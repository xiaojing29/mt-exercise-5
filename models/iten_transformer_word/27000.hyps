<unk> year I showed these <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for nearly three million years , had the size of the United States , <unk> , has <unk> of 40 percent .
I love this <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a way , the heart <unk> of climate system .
It was <unk> by <unk> and <unk> .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You see , you know , it <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That &apos;s the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , of five years , more or more , it &apos;s like the blood , that &apos;s where it &apos;s from the body .
In 25 years it was <unk> by this way , so .
This is a problem because the <unk> is <unk> <unk> around the ocean <unk> where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> , are <unk> in <unk> from the <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> from global <unk> , that amount of <unk> , that <unk> could <unk> , <unk> this point .
In some of the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> is already <unk> by water .
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> was <unk> with a <unk> team at <unk> last <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! Al <unk> : She &apos;s all right . The question is if we <unk> it .
One is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the north .
This is a river in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> had never <unk> similar levels .
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how to <unk> the sea level to <unk> on <unk> , here is where the sea is going to be .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
On the other side of the planet : <unk> , the largest ice <unk> of the planet .
<unk> month scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of ice is in <unk> , and that the Western <unk> , which <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> at six feet of the level of <unk> , like in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the <unk> third largest <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which few years ago were <unk> .
<unk> percent of the world &apos;s population <unk> half of <unk> water from that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : this <unk> is the source of the water <unk> of this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same happens to <unk> water .
In California , <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> of 40 percent .
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they &apos;re <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the world leads to a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and without <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years , <unk> than the <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the whole <unk> .
If you look at it in the <unk> context , you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we &apos;ve <unk> 70 million <unk> of every day .
Look at <unk> the area of the <unk> <unk> , from <unk> , to <unk> , and on both the parts of the <unk> <unk> , where there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean .
The greater cause of the global warming , together to the <unk> , which is 20 percent of <unk> , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of two countries with more emissions with China .
And you <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> <unk> .
But we &apos;re starting to a <unk> of direction .
These are the <unk> projects in the last few years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
Every way , there is a political <unk> in our country .
The <unk> of <unk> and oil have <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I <unk> image something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it on the <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> of <unk> in America .
It &apos;s been <unk> around <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> the <unk> is a <unk> guy .
It &apos;s <unk> here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Al <unk> : From here , this is a big <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
The greatest society on the <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , a part of them .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> , we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business .
So , we &apos;re going to have a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to public and <unk> the truth about <unk> .
It &apos;s actually not <unk> .
We think it &apos;s <unk> -- it &apos;s also a good <unk> .
So , we don &apos;t have to <unk> climate change .
We could do it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you &apos;ve heard of them .
So we &apos;re going to <unk> a <unk> structure as much <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> are a little <unk> , but that &apos;s the sound of <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> is between the <unk> <unk> <unk> , but the <unk> technology <unk> that you see change everything .
Let &apos;s look at this : this is the <unk> technology of <unk> .
Al <unk> : <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security .
<unk> : <unk> America is in the crisis ; the economy , the national security crisis .
The <unk> that all the <unk> of : our <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and oil .
Now , though , there &apos;s a new solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan to <unk> America to work , <unk> more <unk> , and help <unk> the global <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we can solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
<unk> : This is the last one .
<unk> : <unk> : This is about <unk> energy .
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> the end of the <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , a new <unk> network .
<unk> <unk> 2 : <unk> <unk> <unk> for jobs .
<unk> : <unk> America . It &apos;s time to be <unk> .
Al <unk> : A <unk> <unk> says , &quot; If you want to go alone .
If you want to go away , go together . &quot;
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED I made an <unk> on <unk> .
And I &apos;m trying to <unk> to <unk> how the machine works .
So I <unk> here . And for the people who were there , the <unk> is the largest experiment ever <unk> -- ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were there less than a <unk> of a second from the beginning of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second .
All of that is just <unk> .
This is the <unk> machine .
We <unk> these <unk> <unk> into the <unk> .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> feet and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> feet .
This is a <unk> picture of <unk> in building so you can see the <unk> .
<unk> 10 <unk> last year .
And this picture was taken by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> of particles that he had done all the turn of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles inside the <unk> .
In other words , when I <unk> that image the 10 <unk> , I would <unk> that the camera , which is a great <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if that was that <unk> us , or this , when somebody <unk> on Google and they would say the <unk> page was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a <unk> impact on the scientific <unk> .
And I had a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to be these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> bring <unk> <unk> when the machine works at the <unk> of <unk> .
Now , the <unk> of you <unk> the <unk> and <unk> , &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot;
And they can do it because when they &apos;re very <unk> to become the <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees , at a temperature <unk> to that the space between stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> of <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and <unk> <unk> about 30 <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , which we &apos;ve done .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
Now they &apos;re <unk> now everybody in their <unk> place .
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> is going to be new <unk> .
We <unk> it , and we <unk> it to get some data <unk> or <unk> , and continue so our <unk> to find out what the <unk> are going to find out what the universe is .
Now , of course , in some way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering engineering to <unk> . It &apos;s easy to <unk> .
I think that &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that I think is the value of things like <unk> .
I &apos;d like to end with a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who , <unk> , in <unk> of <unk> <unk> experiments of his <unk> , his <unk> was Michael <unk> , said , &quot; No <unk> is that we &apos;re not <unk> in nature , which our science are <unk> , that our <unk> are <unk> , that our <unk> are <unk> , and that are not <unk> in nature , which our <unk> are <unk> , and that are not <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to <unk> <unk> when , as a child , as a child , <unk> with <unk> .
<unk> as I was <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , actually <unk> and <unk> , actually <unk> to think and <unk> problems .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way most of the world around us .
So , as a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with objects , with my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started to <unk> : &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having the <unk> <unk> as a digital <unk> that <unk> on a digital <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> that &apos;s <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> a <unk> information with both hands ,
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
And the question was so interesting that I decided that I was building the answer , building <unk> .
<unk> , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as big as a <unk> .
<unk> , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as big as a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , they can <unk> each other , and they have a screen and they have a screen <unk> and a <unk> <unk> .
But <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> .
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> the digital information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> <unk> of the movement , the other people , and as they become more <unk> , <unk> of their movement , to <unk> their own <unk> , how we can explore new and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Let &apos;s start with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you some video of the video . If you put it in one direction , the <unk> video so , if you <unk> on the other side .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> .
If you <unk> them , you know , you &apos;re <unk> to what it &apos;s going around them .
If they &apos;re <unk> , they <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
If they &apos;re <unk> , they <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We then realized that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> <unk> was the <unk> that we could use common on data , for example , as if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> of <unk> and I can <unk> them to <unk> the color in that central , where they <unk> .
and I can <unk> them to <unk> color in that central .
If you get too much , we can <unk> a little bit .
There are also <unk> possibilities of <unk> , like <unk> , <unk> and <unk> games where people can try things quickly , and they <unk> the results immediately .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a <unk> <unk> that I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a game of words that &apos;s <unk> half between <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , every <unk> <unk> a letter <unk> , on every <unk> , <unk> , at every <unk> , <unk> a letter <unk> to <unk> on every <unk> , and while I was <unk> <unk> on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try and .
Thank you .
Here are <unk> kids in <unk> at the <unk> <unk> , I did a little <unk> of them and <unk> a video .
They &apos;re very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of <unk> .
They just wanted to say , &quot; <unk> of the words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s some other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , and on the right .
It actually wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
You could build a tool for the <unk> of <unk> . He &apos;s <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now he brought a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> work ! Yeah !
So , we <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> can make the characters .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with open final , and it can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with open final , and it can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time to show you is a tool that I &apos;ve been doing is a tool , and I recently .
It &apos;s a tool , that &apos;s a tool that &apos;s made of music .
The <unk> here is <unk> by <unk> as basic , low and <unk> .
<unk> of these has four different <unk> , and you can choose which you use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
And we just <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
These are effects that you can control from , like <unk> and <unk> .
They <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> it .
And then you have the <unk> effects of time and <unk> , which is <unk> to the entire sequence .
It &apos;s how it works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> a <unk> base of a two <unk> <unk> , the <unk> in a series , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Now , we &apos;re going to <unk> a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> : Now <unk> <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> : And now I &apos;m <unk> the <unk> to the <unk> , so I can control the effect of alive .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the entire sequence of time from one side or the other .
<unk> : <unk> : And now we <unk> the <unk> <unk> to give <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the sequence of flight .
So I don &apos;t have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> it , <unk> or more <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the entire sequence on the left the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new <unk> <unk> <unk> as they work , and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this path , and some possibilities that we &apos;re trying to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to <unk> is that it &apos;s going to <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> , which <unk> information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time I &apos;m going to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and <unk> .
And it doesn &apos;t look like me .
But , this particular thing happened was <unk> in my life and career , which led me to <unk> the whole relationship with this job .
The particular thing is I &apos;ve <unk> this book , this <unk> called &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which , <unk> , &quot; which , <unk> from my <unk> books , for some <unk> reason in the world and <unk> a big <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that <unk> everywhere I &apos;m going to be <unk> now , people like I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I &apos;m going to be <unk> and say , &quot; You don &apos;t have any <unk> that you can &apos;t do better ?
You &apos;re not afraid to keep writing for all of life that you could be able to create a book that can <unk> someone to be able to do someone ? &quot;
that it could be <unk> to someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , except I remember that over 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a <unk> -- that I wanted to be a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to be at the same <unk> <unk> .
And people said , &quot; <unk> &apos;t you know how to have success ?
<unk> you don &apos;t fear that <unk> <unk> you ?
You &apos;re not afraid to do this <unk> all over the life that nothing has ever come out and die on a <unk> of <unk> dreams with the mouth of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> like that , you know .
The short answer to all of these questions is , is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yeah , I fear of all those things .
I &apos;ve always been afraid .
And I also <unk> a lot of other things that people could not be <unk> .
Like <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as I &apos;m about writing what I thought and <unk> me is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It &apos;s <unk> that anyone who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel to do .
But what &apos;s so particular about the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about health <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not ?
How do my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and not remember one time in his <unk> <unk> in his <unk> , asked if they were afraid to be <unk> ?
There was never -- that <unk> of the <unk> John , how did it go ?
Don &apos;t do that way , <unk> ?
<unk> , the engineers like <unk> don &apos;t have certainly , in <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> but <unk> of all kinds , we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
And so , as we <unk> to look at the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , young and often <unk> for them .
And the ones that don &apos;t seem to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before I die , in the last <unk> said , &quot; Every my book I <unk> a little bit more &quot; <unk> . &quot; <unk> <unk> about the work of their life .
But we didn &apos;t know when we <unk> it , because we &apos;ve heard these things so long that we &apos;ve got completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> the <unk> , at the end , at the end , <unk> , <unk> always <unk> the <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> to everybody here today is : <unk> you agree with this idea ?
You &apos;re all right to this thing -- because it &apos;s also <unk> from a <unk> distance to me not .
I think it &apos;s <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s also <unk> and I don &apos;t want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to <unk> our big <unk> to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> towards the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I &apos;m in in my career .
<unk> -- look -- look , I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;ve been about 40 years old .
I still have about four <unk> of work in me .
And it &apos;s very <unk> that whatever you &apos;re going to <unk> from the world as the work that I <unk> after my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we are all <unk> here -- is <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
You know , the kind of thought that leads a person to start <unk> <unk> at nine <unk> <unk> at nine <unk> <unk> . And I don &apos;t want to do it .
I continue doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so I think , after many <unk> , that the way to work to keep writing is that you &apos;re going to keep writing a <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to have a <unk> <unk> between me , which I &apos;m <unk> , and my natural <unk> that <unk> that <unk> that <unk> that <unk> that <unk> that <unk> that <unk> that <unk> that last year , trying to find other societies for year , looking through time , looking through the other societies to see if you have a <unk> of the best ideas .
as helping people <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research led me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s because it &apos;s going to be <unk> back and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don &apos;t believe that creativity <unk> from men , OK ?
It turns out that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> from some <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for <unk> reasons and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
The <unk> were the same idea , but they were <unk> that sort of spirit without a <unk> body .
which is <unk> , because the <unk> doesn &apos;t really <unk> that a <unk> was particularly smart .
And we thought a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally <unk> into the <unk> of a <unk> artist &apos;s <unk> , a little bit like the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> of that work .
<unk> <unk> , that &apos;s the distance I &apos;m talking about -- that <unk> <unk> you &apos;re going to <unk> you from the results of your work .
And everybody <unk> that was so that we could <unk> , right ?
So the <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like the too <unk> , right ?
If your work was <unk> not to <unk> <unk> all the <unk> , you all know that you &apos;re going to have been <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your <unk> job , it wasn &apos;t all <unk> your , right ?
Everybody knows that it was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> creativity <unk> a lot of time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and everything , and we <unk> this great idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe over all the <unk> and no longer let &apos;s <unk> creatures that are <unk> from the <unk> .
This was the <unk> principle and <unk> <unk> and people started to think that creativity was completely from <unk> .
And for the first time in history , you start <unk> to this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think that was a big <unk> .
I think that &apos;s a simple person , a simple person to believe that they &apos;re like a source , the <unk> and the <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s like a <unk> to somebody <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> the <unk> and creates all of these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years .
And , if that &apos;s true , and I think it &apos;s going to be , and I think it becomes , and now ?
Can we do that <unk> ?
<unk> back to a <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t do 500 years of thinking about this in a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience who are <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> on their projects .
You probably won &apos;t all <unk> about this thing .
But the question I would like to <unk> is -- why not ?
Why not we &apos;re not going to be like this ?
Because more sense of everything that I &apos;ve ever heard to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process .
A process that , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so basically , everyone here -- knows , you don &apos;t have <unk> <unk> .
And , in fact , it can sometimes look completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , who has now 90 years , but he was a <unk> for his entire life and said that during his <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> , <unk> out in the fields , and <unk> it , in the fields , and <unk> it , in the <unk> , and <unk> it , within them if a <unk> from the <unk> .
He said , he was like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> <unk> to her from the <unk> .
They <unk> it , because it <unk> the earth under his feet .
We decided to have one thing to do to that point and was of , words , &quot; <unk> as a <unk> . &quot;
And so he went back to the house and he was <unk> by this <unk> , and he wouldn &apos;t have anything to take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> on the page .
<unk> times you can &apos;t get enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> them without getting to home and <unk> her <unk> and she would <unk> them through the <unk> , looking , looking at how she said , &quot; another <unk> . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this piece of the time , it never -- there were moments when the was almost <unk> , right ?
So , he was <unk> at home and he was looking for paper and he was looking through , and he was a <unk> just in the while he was <unk> , and he was like , he was like , if you <unk> with the other hand and the <unk> .
It <unk> the tail <unk> and <unk> into his body and <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the page <unk> and <unk> but <unk> , from the last word to first .
So when I <unk> him -- it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not all my process process -- I &apos;m not a <unk> !
I &apos;m a <unk> , and my way to <unk> is ; I <unk> it every day and <unk> work and <unk> and work and <unk> and <unk> over <unk> .
But even me , in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I &apos;m <unk> that many of you will do .
You know , even if I work and the ideas I <unk> them from a certain source , I could not <unk> <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it so we can &apos;t <unk> our head , but , rather , that <unk> <unk> face ?
As far as I am <unk> , the best example that I have <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;ve <unk> several years ago for a <unk> .
I was talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the artist <unk> <unk> <unk> , looking at these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then he <unk> , he <unk> , and he was <unk> on a day , he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , <unk> it .
<unk> fast and everything about a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> , which comes in his head as a <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , you know , and <unk> , and she wants , you know , she &apos;s wonderful , and she doesn &apos;t know how to <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
So it starts to hear this kind of old <unk> <unk> in him , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to <unk> by this <unk> song .
I &apos;m not <unk> enough and I can &apos;t <unk> . &quot;
And instead of going to the <unk> , they <unk> .
<unk> the whole process of <unk> and made something completely new .
I just got the sky and said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t see that I &apos;m <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Do you think it can write a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you know , you &apos;re <unk> when I can take care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> more .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And his process <unk> <unk> after that .
It wasn &apos;t working , it was still <unk> as always as always as a time .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he was <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that he <unk> out of his <unk> <unk> , and he <unk> it back where he was , he didn &apos;t have to be a <unk> thing and <unk> .
but I was <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this thing <unk> , but it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
So , how much that <unk> story to change a little bit about a way that I <unk> and I &apos;m going to <unk> once .
This idea , I &apos;m <unk> when I was <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; and <unk> , &quot; and <unk> in one of those <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re all working on something and we <unk> them , and you start thinking it will be a book , which is going to be the book <unk> .
Not just <unk> , just the book wrote .
And we started thinking about this project .
But then I &apos;m <unk> to <unk> that I <unk> to the air and <unk> .
So I <unk> my face up from <unk> and <unk> my face to a <unk> corner of a room .
And I said <unk> , &quot; <unk> , what , both of them , and we know that if this book is not going to be <unk> , my <unk> ?
Because you see , I &apos;m <unk> all I have , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
Okay . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , I don &apos;t do anything .
I started writing the same because it &apos;s my job .
And I &apos;d like to please that it was <unk> that I &apos;m <unk> to do my own . &quot; Because the end is so , OK , so <unk> does in the <unk> of Africa , the people <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> at the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every while , I <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually actually <unk> .
And I know you know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you &apos;ve all seen , at some point , a <unk> like this .
It was like time , it was <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it wasn &apos;t doing anything different from the usually , like the <unk> <unk> before , but it was all <unk> .
And suddenly , we don &apos;t just <unk> as a human .
But it <unk> from <unk> and <unk> in the fire of <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , they <unk> it with his name .
<unk> hands and <unk> to <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , they <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> from &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which is still you can hear in the <unk> or in <unk> .
In <unk> , when an artist did something impossible to <unk> and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it &apos;s <unk> because we need it .
But , the problem comes the day , for the same , when you <unk> and <unk> that are the 11 of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> God is no longer there .
It &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> with a big <unk> <unk> , and maybe it never <unk> more to <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God again as I <unk> , and what <unk> it must do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so <unk> if you can &apos;t believe , <unk> , <unk> , that the most <unk> <unk> of your being come from yourself .
But let &apos;s just <unk> that you data in <unk> from a <unk> of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to another one .
And , you know , if we think it in this way it changes .
And so I started <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> like I <unk> it for several months in the book that was soon , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of my success .
And what I have to keep <unk> when I feel <unk> on this is , not being <unk> .
Don &apos;t <unk> . You just have your work .
<unk> <unk> for your part , whatever it can be .
If your work is <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> .
If the <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> to you <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for one moment through your <unk> , then <unk> !
<unk> , you do the same <unk> .
And &quot; <unk> ! &quot; to you do that .
I think , and I think , is <unk> <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; to you do that , even for having had love and <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know I &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects about the human genome , what <unk> can <unk> and discovery of new genes of genes .
We &apos;re now <unk> a new path . We &apos;re starting to <unk> biology and now starting from that digital code , we &apos;re <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We &apos;ve been trying to <unk> big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; <unk> is something that a lot of <unk> I think they have <unk> to understand various levels .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to <unk> terms .
We &apos;re <unk> for about 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome has been <unk> to move from the <unk> world of the computer biology to the digital world of computers .
Now , we &apos;re <unk> : Can we <unk> life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species of the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> a <unk> even a smaller <unk> .
We &apos;re able to <unk> a <unk> of about 500 genes that are here .
But when we look at his <unk> map , it &apos;s <unk> as simple as we are .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at a time , it &apos;s very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell .
So , we thought the only way to <unk> this <unk> was <unk> this <unk> so that we could <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions <unk> .
And so we started the <unk> of &quot; <unk> . &quot; Can we <unk> a <unk> ? &quot;
Can the chemistry <unk> to produce these big molecules that we &apos;ve never done before ?
And , in case , can make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The speed with which we &apos;re able to <unk> the life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the code , instead , <unk> rather slowly , but it &apos;s <unk> .
And our most <unk> results bring on a <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before experiments .
But we &apos;ve found that DNA <unk> is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA , of the <unk> <unk> of 30 to 50 <unk> and is a <unk> process : the more <unk> is along , the more <unk> , there are .
So we had to develop a new <unk> <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , starting from information digital information digital genome .
It &apos;s a little <unk> that you can <unk> bacteria .
We designed the <unk> , we <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of about <unk> <unk> .
And what &apos;s interesting is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> it in bacteria , the bacteria <unk> that they <unk> and <unk> the <unk> particles .
The <unk> particles have been there are <unk> by the cells , they <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ve been talking about the <unk> members of the <unk> industry that they &apos;ve been doing this model .
They have <unk> more than you .
We think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we could do the <unk> things in big .
You could build the entire <unk> of <unk> .
They are more than <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we thought we &apos;re going to <unk> in the size of the virus , so that we can change the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> information with information <unk> in a computer , these are very <unk> .
When we did this genome for the first time in <unk> , the standard <unk> was of a <unk> <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve discovered , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If you were used that original sequence never <unk> states to do it .
A part of the process is designing <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> elements here .
You probably have read that <unk> us from the <unk> .
So , we have a <unk> code that <unk> <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , about 20 <unk> <unk> , and there &apos;s a <unk> order of <unk> for every <unk> .
So we can use the <unk> code for <unk> words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did was we did at the beginning , it was <unk> .
Some of them have been <unk> by the fact that it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> <unk> .
And we started <unk> parts , we <unk> with <unk> <unk> from five to seven <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> at the time to get <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , we made these <unk> <unk> in <unk> so that we &apos;re trying to create an extremely <unk> <unk> <unk> as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re looking at the process .
So , this looks like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
When I started these <unk> <unk> , the more than 100 <unk> <unk> <unk> , no <unk> <unk> into the <unk> <unk> .
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> biology .
So we &apos;ve <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
Here &apos;s an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> <unk> .
<unk> hours , it &apos;s <unk> hours , exactly like it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can <unk> completely .
You have to live under <unk> .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life is going into space , and it <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
<unk> , NASA has shown that this happens .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we &apos;ve built these <unk> , just using the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s such a big <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that we <unk> a time of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we &apos;ve done a little bit of time ago .
They are more than <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s the largest <unk> <unk> structure ever <unk> by human .
It has a <unk> weight <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a 10 <unk> without <unk> , you &apos;d just <unk> pages to <unk> this code <unk> .
Now , how do we make it work ? How can we <unk> it ?
<unk> , of course , through a virus is a <unk> game .
It &apos;s a little bit more <unk> when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s <unk> cells as well as it is about <unk> cells as our : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the process of <unk> .
In <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> instead of <unk> into the cell , but we have <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re able to do a <unk> <unk> of a cell <unk> from one cell to another and <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> species .
The two are different as men from the <unk> .
We &apos;ve <unk> some <unk> <unk> in a way that you could decide what you &apos;re going to choose to be .
He then <unk> it with the <unk> so that he <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> . We <unk> the new <unk> <unk> went into the cell .
And we had to <unk> that we didn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to <unk> them more .
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere , we &apos;re going to <unk> into a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So who thinks evolution as a <unk> only <unk> at the time you <unk> doesn &apos;t understand much of biology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell didn &apos;t <unk> one .
The <unk> <unk> we <unk> it .
It <unk> , and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material , it <unk> , and we <unk> it , and we <unk> with only the cell phone and the new <unk> .
has become blue because of the genes that we &apos;ve <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all of the <unk> of a species , and it &apos;s <unk> of all into a new species , <unk> on the new software that we &apos;ve <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the <unk> code exactly what we &apos;ve <unk> you .
Now , this could be <unk> <unk> , but we <unk> the software DNA , we can change things in a fairly <unk> <unk> .
Now , I &apos;ve already <unk> that you &apos;re not talking about <unk> -- but <unk> progress from three million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> <unk> new species on this digital process of <unk> <unk> new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We &apos;re going to spend from six billion people to <unk> billion over the next 40 years .
Just to give an example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> ; in 40 years , there are four .
We &apos;re <unk> problems now to find food , water <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , six and a half billion people .
We &apos;re going to be <unk> to do this for nine billion .
We &apos;re <unk> over five billion <unk> , over 30 billion <unk> of <unk> .
That means 100 million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process to <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
And we have to <unk> that all of the <unk> of the <unk> CO2 from these materials that are in the atmosphere .
<unk> today , because of the <unk> of <unk> all over the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that &apos;s <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry <unk> only a <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from reality and our imagination .
We have <unk> , we &apos;re going to have to <unk> , and we &apos;re able to create what we call the <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think of <unk> these 20 million genes of different genes or trying to <unk> the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , with a small team , and create more biology that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> , <unk> chemistry or chemistry , or chemical production , <unk> <unk> .
This is a few <unk> software that we &apos;re working on to be able to <unk> and design species to be able to <unk> and design species to the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how to be .
We know exactly what their code is .
We &apos;re now <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> generation .
You also saw <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We <unk> <unk> <unk> and third generation that will be quite soon from the <unk> to <unk> <unk> as the <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a very large impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> at all the CO2 before , which we &apos;re working on how much <unk> it , and we &apos;re working on to design , and we think we could have the first <unk> of <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> solar <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> we <unk> in the <unk> .
It &apos;s going to be in the deep ocean , about <unk> meters <unk> to the temperature of water .
<unk> <unk> by using hydrogen <unk> as energy .
We &apos;re looking at understanding if we can <unk> the CO2 , that can easily be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , we think we might be able to <unk> what we might be able to <unk> what life is . We have the <unk> goal for &quot; We , <unk> , we have the <unk> goal for the whole <unk> industry .
<unk> . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t do that ?
We &apos;re going to have a major source of energy .
<unk> , we &apos;re working on the same <unk> to use the same <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
You &apos;ve seen this year with the flu , we always back a year and a dollar less when it comes to find the right <unk> .
I think that you can change building <unk> in <unk> .
This is how the future could start to look <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> the tree with <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> cells .
We are so much to <unk> people .
Our purpose is to make a way of living a long enough to try to <unk> it . Thank you very much .
First of all , I &apos;m going to show you , the <unk> possible , some fundamental work , of the new technology that we took to the <unk> <unk> to a <unk> almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
It &apos;s a environment in which you can <unk> is local <unk> that you can <unk> is a huge amount of data .
Here we are seeing <unk> of <unk> photos with a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , for a fast <unk> , <unk> the images as we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much the amount of information that we see , how big these <unk> of data or images .
Most of them are common <unk> , but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in any time . It &apos;s also very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , a whole example of data not images .
This is the <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
To <unk> that it &apos;s just <unk> and not <unk> , we can do such a thing , to make sure it &apos;s about a real <unk> of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little bit of a <unk> way to read a <unk> book .
You don &apos;t know that .
This is a <unk> example . This is a <unk> number .
Every big image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And I really <unk> you and the beautiful experience of reading the real <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> kind of a half a .
We also did something with the corner of the <unk> of this particular number of The <unk> .
We &apos;ve created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much higher than the one uses in a normal <unk> , and we <unk> the <unk> content .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even the <unk> <unk> .
And that &apos;s really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
We think this is going to put the <unk> and other <unk> <unk> , not to be <unk> .
Of course , <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say we have <unk> <unk> to give in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. <unk> over a NASA <unk> .
So now we &apos;re going to go back to something else .
This is actually live on the Web ; you can see it .
This is a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> research , very interesting that &apos;s done by <unk> <unk> , a student of the <unk> of Washington , with the help of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s live on the Web , <unk> by <unk> .
You can see when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from one image to another and have this kind of experience <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here actually actually has meaning .
So , the <unk> <unk> of the computer <unk> have <unk> these images together , so that they <unk> the <unk> places that the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk> . Here &apos;s what you see of the elements of a <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> , and these things were all <unk> , and these things were all <unk> <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to spend directly to one of the <unk> data and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that we &apos;ve done for the first time the summer of <unk> to show what &apos;s really the key behind this technology , <unk> . And it &apos;s not <unk> as <unk> by looking at the <unk> that we &apos;ve <unk> to the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> and so forth .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> . <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> an image that you &apos;ve got a picture that &apos;s been discovered <unk> to this model .
So , they &apos;re all <unk> images and have all been <unk> at the <unk> level this way .
And you can <unk> this in this <unk> way .
You know , I would never thought of <unk> to work for <unk> .
It &apos;s very <unk> to <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think we &apos;re going to see that it &apos;s a lot of different kinds of <unk> : that &apos;s cell phones to the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I can <unk> them to look at those <unk> .
Many are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
You &apos;re <unk> a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from <unk> to the physical to the physical to the physical <unk> .
The <unk> point is that we can do some things with the social environment . This is now <unk> data from the whole <unk> memory of how the Earth the way that Earth is from the whole <unk> , from the <unk> point of view and <unk> all that data .
All of those pictures become <unk> together , greater than the <unk> of the parts .
You have a model of the Earth &apos;s <unk> .
Think about this as the <unk> of <unk> &apos;s work on Earth .
It &apos;s something that <unk> in complexity , as people <unk> it , and the <unk> <unk> for those who <unk> <unk> it with the use of .
Their photos are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people .
If someone is a idea of <unk> all of these <unk> <unk> the name , my picture of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> is <unk> of all those data , and I can use the as a <unk> <unk> to <unk> in that space , in that <unk> , using the pictures , using the <unk> of anyone else , and to have an experience of social kind and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all of this is extremely <unk> <unk> of every part of the Earth , not only by <unk> <unk> and <unk> images .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What &apos;s the software that your software will <unk> us to do is that at some point , in the next few years , all the pictures are that are that <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is there , it &apos;s basically <unk> .
It &apos;s creating <unk> , if you want , in the images .
And he &apos;s doing it in the <unk> content .
And what it becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> information that a lot of these images are .
As you make a <unk> research , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the page , it &apos;s a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture <unk> all of your photos ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really huge . It &apos;s a <unk> effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it &apos;s really incredible . <unk> .
<unk> : I &apos;m going to talk a lot .
One of the main <unk> when <unk> <unk> and one of the <unk> research is the <unk> that you can live between who has no <unk> <unk> <unk> , between the wind , <unk> it in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> it in the <unk> <unk> of the plants .
We think that the <unk> <unk> will <unk> even beyond the <unk> <unk> , or that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , or that in <unk> , the <unk> still <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , and that the idea that we live in there is no sense , but it &apos;s just a model of reality ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , well , or bad , a lot of <unk> is .
And , of course , everybody <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . Everybody <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We have to <unk> the death <unk> , so we don &apos;t <unk> if we were <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art .
What <unk> is the particular <unk> of the song , the <unk> of the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that matter the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> .
He was my <unk> <unk> in the <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> <unk> , the mother &apos;s mother &apos;s <unk> .
All of these <unk> are <unk> that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And , if you <unk> a second , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of the world create a <unk> of <unk> life and <unk> that <unk> the planet , as the <unk> <unk> <unk> known as <unk> as <unk> as <unk> <unk> .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the total <unk> of all the <unk> , the dreams , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being from the human imagination .
<unk> is the <unk> <unk> of humanity .
It &apos;s the <unk> of what we can be and what we can be as a <unk> species .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or on the <unk> of <unk> just because it &apos;s <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> -- in the field of diversity -- and you can &apos;t even <unk> even at the <unk> <unk> -- the diversity of <unk> .
The <unk> of that is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just <unk> by a <unk> or a series of rules .
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of the <unk> that every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> , a thought , a <unk> <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we &apos;re sitting here at <unk> , at least half not <unk> in the <unk> of children .
They &apos;re not <unk> to children , which means , unless you <unk> something , which is already <unk> .
What &apos;s more <unk> than the <unk> of being <unk> by the <unk> , of the last being <unk> , or not having a way to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the children &apos;s <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of someone in a few weeks , every two weeks of a <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> with it in the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> language .
And I know somebody of you say , &quot; <unk> &apos;t that good ?
The world would not be a better place if we all the same language ? &quot; <unk> , then we &apos;re all talking about . <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> a <unk> thing means that we can &apos;t talk about their language .
So , today I &apos;d like to make you a journey through the <unk> --
And I &apos;m a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we &apos;re <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say &quot; different ways of <unk> &quot; I mean , &quot; I really think of different ways of <unk> .
So , for example , this <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , which <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s not able to <unk> the blue color from green because the time <unk> is <unk> in the forest , which <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; : you have to <unk> a person talking about a different language .
Everything has <unk> in the past <unk> , though the <unk> is that in these <unk> families , they &apos;re talking about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> nobody <unk> .
You &apos;re <unk> to listen and then <unk> .
I had one of the most interesting <unk> that I lived with , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> contact with a <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;ve done <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> <unk> forest <unk> never seen anything .
They <unk> the <unk> pictures , they <unk> them , they <unk> their research <unk> or a <unk> , and they didn &apos;t know anything , they <unk> that <unk> the five <unk> with the <unk> .
But <unk> not only <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> with them .
<unk> percent of the death <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We went back to eight <unk> and we found two cases of natural death . And when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was so <unk> , and then they <unk> it . They <unk> <unk> <unk> . They <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> . At any time , they had a <unk> forest .
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and to <unk> the species .
In the early &apos; <unk> , I was <unk> a really interesting task when my <unk> <unk> of <unk> , if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> between <unk> society and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
To make sense of <unk> , I should have to understand the <unk> culture , and the <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s quite a <unk> view of the world .
Very interesting .
If I &apos;m going to talk about the big <unk> of the world , what about ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent has been left out , thinking that <unk> Africa doesn &apos;t have <unk> <unk> . And instead of the <unk> is not something that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> very <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
What makes interesting is that <unk> is the <unk> of life and death .
So the <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to live in the <unk> way that for a short <unk> becomes the <unk> .
That &apos;s why the <unk> <unk> <unk> to say , &quot; <unk> <unk> go to talk about God .
We <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> God . &quot;
And as you &apos;re <unk> , is the spirit that you &apos;re <unk> , how are you going to <unk> you ,
So you <unk> to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> <unk> in the state of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather strong <unk> of the power of the body &apos;s mind at the time when it was <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> that I <unk> lived with the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> civilization <unk> , that once <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a blood <unk> continent , this <unk> has never been <unk> by the <unk> .
And in <unk> , I &apos;ve been <unk> by a <unk> , but their education is extraordinary <unk> .
<unk> are <unk> by <unk> , and they live in a <unk> world , and they live in a world that was <unk> and <unk> in <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> years of nine years from the way to <unk> the nine months of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of mother &apos;s <unk> ,
For that time , they &apos;re <unk> to the values of their society , values that they &apos;re <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or <unk> to say <unk> <unk> .
And at the end of this <unk> <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> out and for the first time in their life at the age of 18 , and they see a <unk> . And in that moment of the <unk> <unk> , all of the <unk> <unk> , everything that they learned in theory about all of all that they &apos;ve learned in the theory of all of it . The <unk> <unk> <unk> ago , and says :
&quot; <unk> ? <unk> as I said . &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> . Now it &apos;s <unk> . Now it &apos;s about you . &quot;
They &apos;re called <unk> <unk> <unk> and they say that we are the <unk> of the world &apos;s <unk> .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think about the <unk> <unk> and the environment is <unk> <unk> and the old story of <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> concept in its <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are closer to Earth than the Earth of us .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> <unk> by <unk> .
There &apos;s no <unk> for these things in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , but <unk> with time and <unk> , created a <unk> of Earth <unk> not on the concept of <unk> <unk> <unk> but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> : the concept that the Earth can only because it &apos;s <unk> by human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
We should say that a <unk> of the <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> spirit that <unk> its <unk> will be a different <unk> , and will have a very different relationship with the mountain or that place to be <unk> with the mountain or that place to be <unk> .
<unk> a <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> to be <unk> .
That made me a human being in my friends , who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> who live in the north <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
If you go to <unk> that these <unk> can create different , we could actually create different <unk> , they would actually start to understand some of their <unk> .
I <unk> this picture at <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is not the potential of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> from two elements .
On one hand , this <unk> <unk> that <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> alone , you have a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit of a <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> with the <unk> of a family <unk> said <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you ever see the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> the <unk> that make a different kind of <unk> , it <unk> it <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . <unk> &apos;t creates a <unk> of the <unk> .
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of the <unk> <unk> in the &apos; <unk> in the &apos; <unk> .
<unk> to my <unk> you can &apos;t <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you &apos;re done , you can &apos;t tell anybody to be <unk> . <unk> <unk> can &apos;t be <unk> because they &apos;re <unk> by a <unk> that you find out in the <unk> , you know , <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s possible to <unk> <unk> only if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now , it &apos;s the <unk> that you find in this <unk> are <unk> of the <unk> , the same kind of necessary to <unk> the <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> species , as they make these <unk> two <unk> don &apos;t similar , but that if you <unk> this way , they create a <unk> <unk> that &apos;s <unk> .
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you go to the <unk> , we &apos;re going to be , &quot; <unk> talk about . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , who <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that in our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If you <unk> it as they <unk> their <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> of plants , the rest of the rest of the <unk> ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
The solution is : you take the <unk> <unk> in a full of the moon and <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
With that you don &apos;t <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , &#91; <unk> &#93; the problem is that even those of us who have to heart <unk> <unk> <unk> them , but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of history than our real world , and it <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , not 300 years , we &apos;re not going to be <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk> <unk> , but rather the way the was that we &apos;ve <unk> and <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> diversity and <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All the <unk> are <unk> in a new <unk> for life .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> like <unk> don &apos;t have <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It &apos;s the power .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you look at a look at the world , you &apos;ll see that these are not <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of the existence of the <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that lived in the <unk> to a generation ago , and now <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> , where you can see the <unk> from the <unk> that seems <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that seems <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> from the <unk> that seems <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of the <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> .
If we <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the <unk> <unk> of politics .
As the <unk> , the <unk> of a <unk> , is <unk> <unk> on the <unk> level , but the <unk> of the <unk> of a <unk> &apos;s <unk> , not only is <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it &apos;s part of the development of the development <unk> .
And you can &apos;t understand the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> until you go from the beginning .
I <unk> the <unk> miles from <unk> in China through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> <unk> , I realized what &apos;s behind the <unk> that I &apos;m going to see what the <unk> that I &apos;m going to talk about .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> at the <unk> <unk> .
That means that it &apos;s been <unk> to the Chinese times of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that led the <unk> <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk> .
It was taken by <unk> in <unk> at the age of two <unk> years under its <unk> because it wouldn &apos;t have to live without having him .
The <unk> , which has done the same , was <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
One day he <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to work for seven years .
The pain of the <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of <unk> is from <unk> present .
<unk> , all of that <unk> to a choice .
<unk> to live in the world of <unk> or <unk> , we want to <unk> the world <unk> of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died said that his greatest fear was that , in our <unk> <unk> view of the world , not only <unk> the entire <unk> of human imagination , to a <unk> <unk> of human imagination , to a <unk> <unk> of thinking , but one day we <unk> from a <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it &apos;s <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , which <unk> us to <unk> <unk> , which <unk> us to the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , and we &apos;re talking about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has to <unk> 300 years old .
That <unk> history doesn &apos;t <unk> me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we <unk> to come .
When these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human , what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all need to be what we are : a <unk> species , which has to make sure all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are big <unk> moments of <unk> moments .
I took this picture on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> island , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> me , he <unk> the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The government has not been <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> to <unk> our <unk> , and we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man is <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> for his life , he <unk> all the <unk> away all of his <unk> .
You have to know that <unk> don &apos;t <unk> the cold , <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> were made of <unk> fish .
The <unk> of this man didn &apos;t <unk> from night or from the <unk> that <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> away , it <unk> the <unk> <unk> in the skin of <unk> and <unk> in their own hand . When I did I <unk> them , <unk> them by them by creating a <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> you &apos;re talking to you ? <unk> . And this , in different ways , &#91; <unk> &#93; is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> the government <unk> has <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of a total <unk> area of a larger <unk> of California and <unk> <unk> together .
It &apos;s their new <unk> . It &apos;s called <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s all the <unk> resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , finally , I think , is quite <unk> to the people that are in these <unk> areas of the planet , <unk> that &apos;s not at all .
It &apos;s for somebody &apos;s house .
<unk> <unk> of human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the time . And for all of these kids , like the dreams of our children , become part of the <unk> <unk> of hope .
<unk> , we are <unk> that <unk> are <unk> that the political <unk> will never <unk> .
We think the <unk> --
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> , but we think the stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our site is <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in the <unk> to bring our public in places to <unk> <unk> from which they <unk> away from how they &apos;ve seen and , <unk> a <unk> <unk> for a <unk> world of <unk> into diversity , and we have to find a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , the world &apos;s <unk> of <unk> diversity , and we have to find a <unk> <unk> world .
where the <unk> of all of the <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I &apos;ve written about this book that I hope you &apos;ve already heard and you &apos;ve heard some <unk> , in case you don &apos;t <unk> them .
I &apos;d like to start with what I call the <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all the societies <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> : &quot; If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens . &quot; The way to do it is to <unk> freedom <unk> . &quot;
The reason is , on one hand , in the fact that freedom is itself a value , is useful , useful , useful for humans .
On the other is that if we &apos;re <unk> , every one of us can do everything that <unk> our <unk> , without nobody <unk> in the name .
The way to <unk> freedom is <unk> choice .
More choices and more <unk> , and more <unk> is their <unk> .
This is , <unk> <unk> so <unk> in society that nobody <unk> <unk> to <unk> in society .
And it &apos;s also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
And I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I <unk> a simple note on the <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that nobody <unk> . <unk> already that nobody <unk> already <unk> is to your <unk> .
Here &apos;s what the <unk> is .
Then you go to the <unk> store for <unk> . <unk> a <unk> : <unk> , radio , <unk> , radio , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there &apos;s a big number of <unk> <unk> .
We can make six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one <unk> .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice .
<unk> fields : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the <unk> services , <unk> <unk> , who were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , you don &apos;t <unk> it .
A <unk> of that , by the way , was that the <unk> never <unk> .
These days they went .
We have a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , especially between cell phones .
Here are cell phones of the future .
My <unk> is the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
If you don &apos;t have that <unk> yet seen in the house , you &apos;re very <unk> , and you &apos;re very soon going to be <unk> .
And what happens is that people <unk> <unk> and <unk> this question . And he <unk> this question is ? The answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do anything .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , they <unk> the same <unk> as choices .
<unk> <unk> : no longer in the United States that you are from the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> you what you have to do .
Instead , <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> says , &quot; OK , we could do A , or <unk> , &quot; A <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> . &quot; &quot; <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You <unk> , &quot; <unk> , what would you do ? &quot;
And the <unk> says , &quot; <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> these <unk> . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; <unk> if you were me , what ? &quot;
And the <unk> , &quot; But I &apos;m not <unk> . &quot;
And the result we call it the <unk> <unk> , <unk> that makes it look like a thing .
But it &apos;s actually not that a <unk> the weight and the responsibility for someone who knows something , is <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> , to <unk> , to someone else that doesn &apos;t know -- and it &apos;s <unk> -- and so not in the <unk> <unk> to make decisions , the patient decisions .
There &apos;s a huge <unk> of products , which is <unk> to people like me and you , if you think about it doesn &apos;t make any sense , because we can &apos;t <unk> it .
But if we can &apos;t <unk> , why are we <unk> them ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> as a fundamental issue is our <unk> now is a <unk> issue , as you see in this <unk> . &quot; We don &apos;t want to <unk> kids . They want to be no longer <unk> . <unk> : we have to <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
That means that every <unk> , at <unk> , you have to decide what you want to be .
<unk> to the family and <unk> , a time perspective , the common perspective , the common perspective , it was that you <unk> as soon as possible .
The only real choice was to who , not when , and even what to do after .
<unk> , everything is really to play .
They &apos;re going to be very smart students , and they &apos;re going to be 20 percent <unk> on a time .
And they &apos;re not because they &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re not <unk> .
but why I &apos;m <unk> , I &apos;m <unk> to say , &quot; <unk> <unk> or not ? <unk> you do it now ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> later ? I have to think before the children or the career ? &quot;
They are <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this <unk> doesn &apos;t <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and don &apos;t have a nice <unk> to my <unk> .
And they really have to do that . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the job : we &apos;re <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> , because the technology allows us to work every minute day from <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> , and I &apos;m not going to say nobody to , where the <unk> works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this incredible <unk> of choice , what is that we have about working ? It &apos;s that we have to decide , <unk> at any time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son play <unk> , with the mobile phone in a <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> in the <unk> .
And even though they &apos;re all <unk> , every minute that we see our son <unk> the <unk> , we &apos;re also <unk> , &quot; I have to answer this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to <unk> this <unk> ? I <unk> to <unk> this letter ? I <unk> this letter ? I <unk> ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , &quot; that &apos;s all the experience of your child &apos;s very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , any <unk> we look , small things and big , and big objects , life is a matter of choices .
Once the world the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but not everything was about choice .
The world of today is this : <unk> is , &quot; Is it a <unk> thing <unk> , or <unk> ? &quot;
The answer is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the <unk> .
<unk> this <unk> <unk> two effects of people on people .
The first one , <unk> , is that it <unk> instead of <unk> .
With a lot of <unk> between you , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I &apos;m going to give you an example : a <unk> study on <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> has had access access to <unk> data , the <unk> <unk> society , with about a million <unk> <unk> in <unk> different companies .
What she found out is that for every 10 to the solutions that are <unk> more , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s 10 percent <unk> in less than when they &apos;re available five .
Because with 50 <unk> between them , is it very difficult to decide , and it &apos;s <unk> to decide .
And in <unk> , and again , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course <unk> never comes never .
<unk> that doesn &apos;t mean just that these are going to be <unk> <unk> for <unk> because they don &apos;t have enough money , they also want to say that the decision is so <unk> that the decision <unk> so that they also <unk> the <unk> <unk> of work .
They &apos;re not <unk> , until five to <unk> <unk> per year from the <unk> of work , which would be well <unk> to <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices .
And I think it &apos;s going to change the world like this .
&quot; And finally , to end the <unk> : <unk> <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
I could just make the right decision , if it &apos;s for <unk> , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and you <unk> the wrong <unk> .
So that &apos;s the first effect . The second is that even if we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice , at the end is less <unk> by the result of how we <unk> states with less <unk> between the <unk> .
And that &apos;s for several reasons .
One of them is that with so many <unk> between the <unk> , if you <unk> one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better . And what &apos;s going on is that <unk> <unk> us to <unk> them to <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> the decision <unk> by <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> decision <unk> by , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> decision ,
even when it was a decision <unk> .
More choices you have , it &apos;s easier to <unk> than any <unk> that is <unk> of choice .
<unk> , there &apos;s what <unk> call <unk> call .
<unk> has <unk> very well <unk> how the value we value to <unk> things from what we <unk> .
You know , when you have a lot of <unk> , it &apos;s easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and be <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;ll <unk> with everyone who &apos;s not in New York .
But that &apos;s what you &apos;re probably going to happen .
There &apos;s this <unk> to the <unk> .
A <unk> place .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not <unk> . But what he thinks , &quot; Well , <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Everybody &apos;s my <unk> to <unk> are away . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> right in front of the house . &quot;
And it <unk> two weeks <unk> from the idea that &apos;s <unk> -- every day -- the chance of <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> the <unk> for what we have , even when we <unk> the choice was <unk> .
And the most of the <unk> that we have from <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> us as a <unk> .
Here &apos;s another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It &apos;s about living the moment , and maybe <unk> to live .
But the most important point is that whatever you <unk> you are <unk> , you &apos;re not doing other .
The things that don &apos;t <unk> have so many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new <unk> of <unk> .
They &apos;re almost always <unk> .
<unk> once the <unk> were just one kind of <unk> , <unk> them and <unk> by <unk> , they were <unk> , only after they had a <unk> and <unk> a lot of times , they would go well .
So , I went to <unk> a couple of new when the people were there , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> said , &quot; <unk> wants to <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
I want them with <unk> or <unk> ? &quot; <unk> &quot; or &quot; <unk> &quot; ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> wants to <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> wants to <unk> or <unk> ? &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; <unk> <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a while I was able to say , &quot; I want the only guy , &quot; I want the only guy , &quot; he had no idea what it was , so for a <unk> I all <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then I <unk> it , and then I <unk> it , and then I &apos;d ever <unk> out of the <unk> .
It was the <unk> . With all that choice I had <unk> the best .
But I &apos;m <unk> worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice , my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn &apos;t know anything about it when I was just one guy , but when I was 100 different , <unk> , at least one of them had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After I <unk> that I was <unk> in <unk> to the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in life of people don &apos;t <unk> the <unk> that these have respect to the <unk> of the <unk> .
And this is <unk> <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of <unk> , it makes it <unk> .
Because if I <unk> it , I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth will be more to that .
&quot; You were better when you were worse , &quot; The reason you were better at the time , is worse than when you were worse , you could even <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world we live in -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things to the <unk> of <unk> .
You never have <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> are <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; Yes , you want it . &quot;
I mean -- little <unk> moment -- that I &apos;m really <unk> , and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn &apos;t have done it better , I didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
But <unk> is not always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> a couple of <unk> <unk> when there is only that you &apos;re not <unk> , and I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; Why ? &quot;
Who is <unk> ? &quot; <unk> , the answer is <unk> .
The world is <unk> . What could I do ?
When you have hundreds of <unk> , and you get one <unk> , and you &apos;ll see who &apos;s the <unk> , is clear that the <unk> you are .
We could have done better .
With hundreds of <unk> , there are no <unk> <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even if the result , it &apos;s <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> and they &apos;re <unk> and they &apos;re <unk> to them .
In the last few years , the <unk> is <unk> in the world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only one , but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is just that people have experiences because the <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation , they think <unk> is they .
So the final result is that in general we &apos;re better , but we &apos;re going to take a worse .
Let me show you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and is completely <unk> . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no <unk> that a little bit better than not <unk> , but from that not <unk> at all , but from this doesn &apos;t <unk> that much choice is better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a <unk> value , <unk> . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m quite sure we &apos;ve <unk> from a piece of the level that the choices <unk> our life .
Now , from a <unk> point of view -- I almost finished -- from a <unk> point of view , <unk> is the <unk> .
What &apos;s allows all this choice in <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There are a lot of places in the world , and you &apos;re <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that they have <unk> .
The problem is they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I &apos;m talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> talked about yesterday about how <unk> those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> are <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> of money .
I mean these choices , <unk> and <unk> , not that they are just <unk> .
They are <unk> <unk> .
They make worse being .
If you have what in our society <unk> , it <unk> to be <unk> in those where people have too few possibilities , not be their lives to <unk> , but also our <unk> .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income is <unk> all -- not just to the poor people -- not just to the poor people -- as this choice in <unk> that <unk> us .
And to <unk> , &quot; <unk> , you can become everything you want . &quot;
<unk> , people of culture , they said , &quot; What are you going to do that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s <unk> that you can &apos;t do anything in a glass <unk> . &quot;
&quot; A <unk> imagination , a <unk> view of the world --
and I <unk> it like this , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I realized that that fish knows a long one .
Because the reality of the fact of the <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk> , so that &quot; everything is possible . &quot; You can &apos;t <unk> the freedom . &quot; <unk> the <unk> . &quot;
If you <unk> the <unk> so that you can <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Everybody needs a <unk> .
This is almost certainly almost certainly too <unk> , maybe for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
