<unk> year I showed these <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years had the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three years had the <unk> <unk> of the United States .
I &apos;m going to <unk> this <unk> of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a sense , the heart <unk> of climate system .
It <unk> <unk> and <unk> of the summer .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You see , you know , you &apos;re <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That &apos;s the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> in the summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , of five years or more , it &apos;s like the blood , which here is <unk> by the body .
<unk> years old , and so on .
This is a problem because the <unk> is the <unk> <unk> around the <unk> of the <unk> around the ocean , where there are huge <unk> <unk> that , <unk> , are <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , that amount of <unk> <unk> , that <unk> could <unk> , <unk> this point of not <unk> .
In a few <unk> <unk> in <unk> the <unk> is already <unk> by water .
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : She &apos;s good . The question is if we &apos;re also going to do it .
That &apos;s why this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a river in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> had never <unk> like that .
This is the <unk> river , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how it &apos;s going to <unk> the sea <unk> on <unk> , here is where the sea <unk> .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
On the other side of the planet : <unk> , the largest ice <unk> of the planet .
<unk> month scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of ice is in <unk> , and that the <unk> <unk> , which <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the largest third largest <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which few years ago were <unk> .
<unk> 40 percent of the world &apos;s population <unk> <unk> by that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : This is the source of the water <unk> of this city .
The <unk> is <unk> .
But when you &apos;re going to <unk> , the same thing as the water is <unk> .
In California <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> of 40 percent .
<unk> <unk> are in crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they &apos;re <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in the world <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a normal , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years of <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the whole thing .
If you look at the context of it , you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we &apos;ve <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every day .
Look at the area of the <unk> <unk> , from <unk> , to <unk> , and on both <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , where there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the oceans .
The largest cause of global warming , together to the <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
The oil is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And you &apos;re going to build a lot of <unk> .
But we &apos;re <unk> to a <unk> of direction .
These are the <unk> projects in the last few years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there &apos;s a political <unk> in our country .
The <unk> of <unk> and oil have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I <unk> image something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it on <unk> .
This is the second largest flow in America .
It &apos;s successful around <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> â™« <unk> the <unk> is a <unk> and happy .
It &apos;s <unk> here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
<unk> the <unk> is more <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> here is a lot of <unk> <unk> .
The largest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , one part .
<unk> : <unk> , we can see the changes as a <unk> <unk> in our business .
So , for our <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public <unk> and <unk> the truth of <unk> .
Actually , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it &apos;s <unk> -- it &apos;s also a good <unk> .
So we don &apos;t want to <unk> climate change .
We &apos;re going to do that .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> -- you &apos;ve heard about that much .
So I &apos;m going to <unk> a <unk> structure as it &apos;s about <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! The machines are a little <unk> , but this is the sound of <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> is between the major <unk> <unk> , but the <unk> technology of <unk> , but the <unk> technology of <unk> that you see changes everything .
And let &apos;s look at this : this is the <unk> <unk> technology .
<unk> : <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> and the national security .
<unk> : <unk> , America &apos;s in the crisis ; the <unk> , national security crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all : our <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and oil <unk> .
Now , there &apos;s a new way , you know , there &apos;s a new solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan to <unk> America to work , <unk> more <unk> , and help <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we &apos;re going to solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
<unk> : This is the last .
<unk> : It &apos;s about <unk> energy to America .
One of the most <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> <unk> two : <unk> <unk> for jobs <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> America . It &apos;s time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A old <unk> <unk> says , &quot; If you want to go to alone .
If you want to go far , you go , you go to the <unk> . &quot;
We have to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year I did a <unk> on <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to try to <unk> on how the car works .
So here it is . And for the ones that the other time there were no , the <unk> is the largest experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
His task is to <unk> the conditions that they were in less than a <unk> <unk> from the beginning of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second .
All right is just <unk> .
This is the <unk> machine .
And I &apos;m going to <unk> these <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> <unk> feet .
This is a <unk> image of <unk> in construction , so you can see the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> last year we <unk> the car for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was because of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
It &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> <unk> that had done all the <unk> , <unk> in <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles in the <unk> .
In other words , when I <unk> that image the 10 <unk> , <unk> that the machine <unk> , which is a big <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if that was that to make us <unk> , or when someone <unk> on Google and <unk> that the page was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a <unk> impact over to be <unk> .
And I was going to take a week later , there was a problem with the car , to just these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works , when the car works ,
Now , the <unk> of you <unk> <unk> and <unk> , &quot; It &apos;s not true . I &apos;m <unk> too <unk> . I &apos;m too <unk> . &quot;
And they can do that because when they &apos;re very <unk> to become <unk> <unk> .
So , <unk> degrees <unk> , at a temperature <unk> to that of the space between stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the most <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and that &apos;s <unk> of about 30 <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We have them <unk> and <unk> .
They &apos;re now <unk> everybody to their <unk> place .
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> is going to be again .
And I <unk> it , and we &apos;re trying to get data to <unk> or <unk> , and on that our <unk> to find out what the <unk> of the universe is .
Now , of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering engineering <unk> . It &apos;s easy to <unk> .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s so hard , I think it &apos;s the value of things like <unk> .
I want to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> <unk> , which , in <unk> <unk> of <unk> experiments of his <unk> , <unk> <unk> , said , &quot; No , it &apos;s so <unk> for the progress of human mind , as <unk> that there are no <unk> to nature &apos;s <unk> , and that there are <unk> <unk> , and that there are <unk> <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> <unk> when , as children , <unk> with <unk> .
<unk> <unk> like <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , actually , to actually think and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way most of the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with objects , together to my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started to <unk> , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of just <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> as a digital <unk> that &apos;s moving on a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> information with both hands ,
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that I was trying to explore the answer , building the <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , they can <unk> them , and they have a screen and they have a screen and a radio <unk> .
But <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> it .
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> <unk> to <unk> the digital information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement of the other , and as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , of the <unk> , of how we <unk> them , we can explore new <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ll start with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you of the video -- if you <unk> it in a direction , the <unk> video , if you <unk> on the other side , <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , you &apos;re <unk> to what they &apos;re doing around them .
If they &apos;re <unk> , and they can <unk> it a little bit .
If they &apos;re <unk> , and they can <unk> it a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We then realized that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was the <unk> that we can use common <unk> on data , for example , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> like <unk> and I can <unk> it to <unk> the color of the <unk> in the <unk> , where you &apos;re <unk> .
and I can <unk> to <unk> color in that central <unk> , where you &apos;re <unk> .
And we can do it a little bit about it , we can <unk> a little bit .
There are also <unk> possibilities of <unk> , like <unk> , <unk> and games and games <unk> , <unk> <unk> , where people can try things , and <unk> the results immediately .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a <unk> sequence that I do with a <unk> <unk> .
So here we have a game here that &apos;s half between <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> a letter <unk> a letter to <unk> on every <unk> , <unk> , every <unk> <unk> a letter <unk> , <unk> a letter <unk> on every <unk> , and as I was <unk> words on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you &apos;ve got a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s <unk> children in <unk> <unk> <unk> , I did , I did so I <unk> them and I <unk> them up and <unk> video .
They &apos;re very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things like this <unk> is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just wanted to say , &quot; <unk> of words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , right there .
It actually wanted to <unk> it .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
I could build a device for the <unk> of <unk> . He &apos;s <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
That &apos;s , it &apos;s doing the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now , he took a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
You &apos;re working ! Yeah ! Yeah !
So , I <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with the final <unk> , and it can decide how to do you <unk> .
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with the final <unk> , and it can decide how to do you <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I &apos;ve been showing you is a <unk> , and I recently did a <unk> <unk> , to <unk> music .
It &apos;s a device that <unk> , <unk> recently , to <unk> music .
<unk> <unk> here , <unk> <unk> like <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> of these has four different <unk> , and you can choose which to use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of your <unk> .
And I just <unk> by doing a <unk> <unk> . &quot;
These are actually effects that you can control live , like the <unk> and the <unk> .
I <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are the <unk> effects of <unk> , which is <unk> to the whole sequence .
<unk> like that .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> in a series , the <unk> in a series , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m going to <unk> a <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : Now , I &apos;m going to <unk> --
<unk> : And now I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> , so I can control the <unk> . So I can control the live in .
<unk> : I can <unk> the entire sequence over time over one side or the other .
<unk> : And now , I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> to give more <unk> .
<unk> : I can <unk> the sequence of <unk> .
So I don &apos;t have to <unk> , but I can <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the entire sequence on the left the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new <unk> <unk> <unk> to how we work our brain and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of this results , and also some possibilities we &apos;re trying to bring out of the <unk> .
The concept I want to <unk> is that it &apos;s <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> <unk> , which information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time of talking to all you .
I &apos;m a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it &apos;s more than that , obviously .
It &apos;s also love and my <unk> of life .
And I don &apos;t look like that .
But , I said this , something particular happened was <unk> in my life and in my career , which led me to <unk> the entire relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I wrote this book , this <unk> called &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And the result is that everywhere I &apos;m going to be <unk> now , people like I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I &apos;m going to go to me now and say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear of being able to do better ?
You don &apos;t fear to keep writing all life , and so much life without being able to create a book that can <unk> someone ? &quot;
What can you get to someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , to part of that I remember more than 20 years ago , when I was trying to tell people -- I was a <unk> -- which I wanted to be a <unk> .
I was <unk> to the same <unk> <unk> .
And people say , &quot; Don &apos;t you want to have success ?
Do you have not fear that <unk> you ?
You don &apos;t fear to do this <unk> for all life without any life that you ever get out and to die on a <unk> of <unk> <unk> ?
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yeah , I fear of all those things .
I always <unk> .
And I also <unk> of many other things that people could not <unk> .
And as the <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as it is about the writing what I thought and I <unk> <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It &apos;s <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel <unk> to do .
But what is there is so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> do they do they do ?
How did my father , for instance , he was a <unk> <unk> and I don &apos;t remember one time in her 40 years of activity in <unk> <unk> ?
There was never -- that <unk> of John <unk> , how did that go ?
Don &apos;t you like that , what ?
<unk> , the engineers <unk> as a group they don &apos;t have , in the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
We have enough , we have this <unk> , and not just <unk> , but we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
And so , not even though looking at the <unk> of the dead <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , young people and often as they .
And even the ones that they don &apos;t seem to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before you die , in the last <unk> said , &quot; Every my book has <unk> me a little more <unk> than a <unk> <unk> of your work .
But I don &apos;t know when I &apos;m going to say that because we &apos;ve heard these things so long , we &apos;ve got completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and creativity <unk> are <unk> in some way , and that art , at the end , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> always <unk> to the <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> all over here today is : you &apos;re <unk> with this idea ?
And you &apos;re going to be good for a <unk> distance to me not . It &apos;s not going to be OK for that .
I think it &apos;s <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s also <unk> and I don &apos;t want to be <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better <unk> our big <unk> to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I &apos;m in my career .
<unk> -- look , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m about 40 years .
I &apos;ve got about four <unk> of work in me .
And it &apos;s very <unk> that everything <unk> of the time in the world is going to be <unk> by the world like the work that <unk> after the last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- is <unk> that my greatest <unk> is my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
You know , you know , the kind of thought that it &apos;s <unk> a person to start <unk> <unk> at nine <unk> <unk> in the morning and I don &apos;t want to do that .
I want to continue doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so , I think , after many <unk> , that the way to work to continue writing is that we can create a <unk> <unk> <unk> , right ?
I have to have to <unk> a few ways to find out , which I &apos;m <unk> , and my natural <unk> on which <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> to get . And as I was going to be looking through the <unk> <unk> , to look at the other societies to see if we could have better than <unk> ideas and more <unk> .
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research took me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And I was because I was <unk> in <unk> and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don &apos;t believe that creativity is <unk> <unk> by men , OK ?
And that <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , for <unk> reasons and <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> <unk> <unk> from far away .
The <unk> were the same idea , but I <unk> that sort of spirit without a <unk> .
And that &apos;s <unk> , because the <unk> didn &apos;t really want a <unk> was particularly <unk> .
And I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally <unk> in the <unk> of a <unk> artist , a little <unk> , a while the <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> out of <unk> <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the work of that work .
<unk> <unk> , that &apos;s the distance I talk -- that <unk> <unk> you from the results of your work .
And everybody <unk> that he was so <unk> , right ?
So the artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like , for example , right ?
If your work was <unk> not to <unk> <unk> all the <unk> , you all <unk> that you have been <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it wasn &apos;t all your <unk> , right ?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> creativity <unk> in <unk> for a long time .
And then the <unk> <unk> and everything , and we <unk> this big idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe on the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the <unk> principle and people think that they &apos;re going to be completely <unk> by the <unk> .
And for the first time in history , you start <unk> to this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> rather than a person with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think I &apos;m going to try to someone , a simple person , to believe that I &apos;m like a source , the source , the <unk> of all the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a responsibility for too big to give to the human <unk> .
It &apos;s like to ask someone to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely the <unk> and creates all of these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in 500 years .
And if that &apos;s true , and I think that &apos;s true , the question becomes , and I think that it &apos;s going to be , and now ?
Can we do that ?
I want to go back to a more <unk> than human relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe it &apos;s not .
Maybe we can &apos;t do 500 years of thinking <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of , <unk> , you do <unk> people <unk> <unk> on their projects .
You probably don &apos;t <unk> all about this .
But the question I would like to <unk> is -- why not ?
Why not you &apos;re not going to be like this ?
Because more sense of everything that I ever heard about to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> process .
And a process that , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so , basically , all of them here -- you know , you don &apos;t <unk> <unk> .
And , in fact , it can sometimes look completely <unk> .
And I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s now 90 years , but that was a <unk> for all life and said that during his <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out of the <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> .
He said that he was like a <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> to her from the <unk> .
And I <unk> it to get it , because it <unk> the Earth under its feet .
I was trying to have one thing to do that point and it was of , words , &quot; <unk> as a <unk> . &quot;
And so I was going to go home and he was <unk> by this <unk> , and he didn &apos;t have any more than you take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> , as the <unk> and <unk> on the page .
<unk> times you can &apos;t be enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without being able to get into the home and the <unk> <unk> through and she would <unk> them to <unk> through the <unk> , looking like she said , &quot; another <unk> . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this piece never <unk> -- there were moments there -- there were moments when the was almost <unk> , right ?
So , he was going to go home and he was looking for paper and <unk> the <unk> through , and I had a <unk> right in the while he was <unk> , and then he said , that he was like , if he <unk> with the other hand and the <unk> .
He <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> in his body and <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the page <unk> and <unk> , but on the <unk> , the last one word to the first word .
So when I <unk> him -- it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not all my <unk> process -- I &apos;m not a <unk> .
I &apos;m a <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> &apos;s <unk> ; I <unk> every day and <unk> and work and <unk> and work <unk> over the <unk> .
But even me , in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I &apos;m going to be that many of you the <unk> .
You know , even though the work and the ideas <unk> me <unk> from a certain source I couldn &apos;t <unk> it .
And what is this ?
And how can we <unk> it in a way we don &apos;t have to <unk> the head , but , what do we <unk> <unk> ?
And as much of the best example , I &apos;ve got is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;ve <unk> several years ago for a <unk> .
I &apos;m talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the artist <unk> <unk> , trying to control , <unk> , <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , <unk> , and one day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , <unk> everything for him .
<unk> fast and everything from a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> , who &apos;s in his head as a <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the <unk> , but it doesn &apos;t know how to <unk> .
It has no piece of paper , it has no <unk> , it has no <unk> .
So , it starts to hear this kind of old <unk> <unk> in him like , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose it from this <unk> <unk> song .
I &apos;m not <unk> enough and I can &apos;t <unk> . &quot;
And instead of going to go to the <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> .
And I <unk> the entire <unk> process and made something completely new .
He just <unk> the sky and said , &quot; <unk> , you don &apos;t see that I &apos;m <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Do you feel a song now ? &quot;
If you really want to <unk> , you &apos;re going to be a <unk> moment when I can <unk> care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> <unk> more .
<unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And his process <unk> <unk> <unk> after that .
It wasn &apos;t the work , it was still <unk> as always as time .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when I was <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> <unk> out of him <unk> , <unk> <unk> that he had to be <unk> <unk> back from where he was , <unk> that he didn &apos;t have to be a <unk> thing and <unk> .
But I <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing , and <unk> <unk> that was not <unk> .
So , how much I &apos;m going to change a little bit even the way I &apos;m going to <unk> and I already <unk> .
This idea , I &apos;m going to be when I was <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and I <unk> in one of those <unk> of the <unk> that we &apos;re all working when we &apos;re working on something and we &apos;re not going to be a <unk> , which will ever be the <unk> book .
Not just <unk> , just the <unk> book .
And I started thinking about this project .
But then I &apos;m going to try to <unk> that <unk> the air and <unk> us .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> corner of a <unk> <unk> .
And I said to <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , what , both of them and we know that if this book is not going to be <unk> .
Because you see me , I &apos;m <unk> everything I have , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , I don &apos;t do .
I started writing the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I would like to please be <unk> that I &apos;m <unk> to do my part . &quot; Because at the end , &quot; Because , it &apos;s so , OK , let &apos;s go into the <unk> of Africa , people <unk> for the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> music , and <unk> music that will be <unk> for hours to the <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk> .
But every while , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these artists , actually <unk> <unk> .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you &apos;ve all got to do , at some point , a <unk> like that .
It was like time , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> through a sort of <unk> and it wasn &apos;t doing anything different from the usually , like the <unk> <unk> <unk> before , but everything <unk> .
And suddenly , not just as a human .
But it <unk> and <unk> under the <unk> of the <unk> .
And when that <unk> , in the time , people <unk> what was , the <unk> with his name .
And I <unk> my hands and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , God , &quot; God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , that you can still feel in the <unk> or the <unk> .
In <unk> , when a artist has done something impossible and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- one <unk> of God .
And it &apos;s <unk> because we need .
But , the problem is coming up the next day , for the <unk> itself , when you &apos;re <unk> and <unk> that are the 11 of the <unk> and the <unk> of God is no more .
It &apos;s just a <unk> with a big <unk> , and maybe I never <unk> to that <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God , as I was going to do the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it &apos;s not to be so <unk> if you &apos;re not <unk> , <unk> , that the most <unk> <unk> of your being being being being from you .
But let &apos;s just just just just <unk> you that you data from a source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk> and somebody else when you &apos;re done .
And , you know , if we think about this way , it &apos;s going to change it .
And so I started <unk> , and it &apos;s certainly how I <unk> it for several months during the <unk> <unk> of my book that I was <unk> soon , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> of my success .
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel that I &apos;m <unk> by that &apos;s , I don &apos;t fear .
Don &apos;t <unk> . You just <unk> your work .
<unk> to <unk> for your <unk> , whatever it can be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , you &apos;re going to be <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for one moment through your <unk> , then , &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
<unk> , do the same <unk> .
And &quot; <unk> ! &quot; to you do the same .
I think and I think I &apos;m <unk> <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; to yourself , even for having <unk> love and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
And as you know , I &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects on the human genome on what it can <unk> and find new <unk> of genes .
We &apos;re now <unk> a new path , we &apos;ve started <unk> the biology and now we &apos;re <unk> in a new <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> in a new <unk> <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We &apos;ve always been trying to <unk> big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; is something that I think they have <unk> to understand how to various <unk> .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> by almost 20 years now .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go from the world <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the computer .
Now , we &apos;re going to <unk> the life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> species from the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> a little more <unk> .
We &apos;re able to <unk> a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that are here .
But when we look at his <unk> map , it &apos;s very simple than our own .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at a time , it &apos;s very <unk> that this can bring to a cell phone .
So I <unk> that the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> so that we could <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of &quot; Can we <unk> a <unk> ? &quot;
Can you create these big molecules that we never have done before ?
And in case , can we make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The speed with which we &apos;re able to <unk> the life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the code , instead , <unk> rather slowly , but it &apos;s <unk> .
And our most <unk> results that are <unk> on a <unk> .
We &apos;ve been <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> many <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before they <unk> the experiments .
But we found that <unk> DNA <unk> is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of the world that <unk> little <unk> of DNA , of the <unk> <unk> of 30 to 50 <unk> and it &apos;s a <unk> process : the more <unk> is , the more <unk> , <unk> there .
So we had to develop a new way to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , <unk> <unk> information <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a little <unk> that you <unk> bacteria .
We designed <unk> , <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> it in bacteria , and they <unk> it in bacteria , and they <unk> the <unk> particles .
<unk> particles have <unk> , and they <unk> the cells , they <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ve been talking about <unk> members of the <unk> industry that they have certainly <unk> this model .
They have <unk> more than you .
And I think this is a situation where the software can actually build its same <unk> in a <unk> system .
But I could do things in big <unk> .
I could build the entire <unk> of <unk> .
They &apos;re more than <unk> <unk> <unk> code .
So we thought we &apos;re going to <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> , so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a cell <unk> .
<unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> with information <unk> in a computer , these are they must be very <unk> .
When I <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> the <unk> <unk> was of a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We found , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If we were used that original sequence never <unk> states .
A part of the process is to design <unk> <unk> that you <unk> with all the other <unk> of the 50 <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> elements here .
You &apos;ve probably read that you have read that you have to <unk> .
So , we have a <unk> code <unk> on four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , and there &apos;s a <unk> order of <unk> for every <unk> .
So we can use the <unk> code for writing words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did we do at the beginning was <unk> .
Some have been <unk> by the fact that it was not <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> <unk> just <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> <unk> .
And we started <unk> parts , <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , we made these <unk> <unk> in <unk> so that we &apos;re <unk> to create a very <unk> <unk> as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to <unk> the process .
So , this looks like a <unk> <unk> .
When I started these <unk> <unk> much , more than 100 <unk> <unk> <unk> , we don &apos;t <unk> directly into the <unk> <unk> .
You get to the <unk> tools of the <unk> <unk> .
So we &apos;ve got to <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA , and then <unk> the <unk> .
Here &apos;s an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> like his <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
In 12 hours , it &apos;s <unk> exactly like it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely <unk> .
<unk> living under <unk> .
They &apos;re absolutely sure that the life <unk> in space , and they &apos;re <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
And actually , NASA has shown that this happens .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we built using these <unk> , just using the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This image not been <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a big <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that I <unk> a time of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we &apos;ve done a little time ago .
They &apos;re more than <unk> <unk> code .
It &apos;s the largest <unk> of a <unk> structure ever <unk> by man .
It has a <unk> <unk> <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 <unk> <unk> , we &apos;ll just <unk> pages to <unk> this <unk> code .
Now , how do we do that ? How can we <unk> it ?
Of course , through a virus is a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a little more <unk> when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s more simple when it &apos;s about cells , you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the <unk> process .
In the <unk> , the <unk> is instead <unk> in the cell , but we &apos;ve <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re able to do a <unk> <unk> from one cell to another and <unk> .
We have <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> .
The two are different than men from <unk> .
We have <unk> some <unk> more <unk> way we wanted to decide what to choose to do for this <unk> .
He then <unk> it with <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I <unk> <unk> that we didn &apos;t want to go beyond , but we tried to <unk> more in there .
This is one of the major <unk> .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So who thinks evolution as a <unk> <unk> at a time that <unk> doesn &apos;t have much <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> DNA .
The <unk> that was in the cell , you know , you know , you know , the <unk> that was in the cell .
The <unk> <unk> we <unk> it .
He <unk> , and he <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material , and we <unk> it , and we <unk> with only the cell that &apos;s <unk> .
It has become blue <unk> because of the genes we &apos;ve <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species , you go to the whole <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> of the whole new software that we &apos;ve <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , and the <unk> are <unk> , and when you &apos;re <unk> the code that &apos;s going to <unk> you .
Now , this could look <unk> , but we <unk> the software DNA , we can change things in a pretty <unk> .
Now , I &apos;ve already <unk> that here &apos;s not about <unk> -- but of progress from three million years and a half million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> in which we &apos;re going to <unk> new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> when we think of our <unk> .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion people to <unk> billion in the next 40 years .
Right to give one example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re going to <unk> now to find food , water and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> for six billion people .
We &apos;re even more <unk> to do it for nine billion .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> of <unk> , <unk> of 30 billion <unk> .
That means 100 million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process to <unk> , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
And we need to <unk> that all the CO2 <unk> from these materials that are going to be in the atmosphere .
At the day today , because of the <unk> <unk> in the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry <unk> only one <unk> about <unk> , and you think about how many different things are <unk> out there .
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from reality and our imagination .
We now have <unk> , thank you to these <unk> <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think of these 20 million different genes , or try to <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology <unk> . And we can create biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard <unk> .
We can <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , chemistry or chemistry <unk> production .
This is a few software <unk> that we &apos;re working on to be able to <unk> and design species on the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how to be .
We know exactly what their <unk> code .
We &apos;re now <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
You saw that you that <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was an <unk> experiment .
We have <unk> <unk> and third generation that will be <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> than the <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> CO2 in matter , and we think we can reach for cells that we can reach this goal , and we think we can get the first <unk> <unk> <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> solar <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> in the world , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> we &apos;ve <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> in the deep ocean , about <unk> feet deep to the temperature of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> by hydrogen <unk> , using <unk> as much energy source .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2 , which can easily be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , we think we can be able to <unk> what we might be able to <unk> what life is . We , we <unk> , <unk> we have the <unk> goal of <unk> the entire <unk> industry .
<unk> . If you can &apos;t do that from TED , where you can &apos;t ?
I &apos;m going to take a main source of energy .
<unk> , we &apos;re working on the same <unk> to use <unk> <unk> .
You saw this year with flu , we always go back a year and with a <unk> in less when it &apos;s about to find the right .
I think that you can change building <unk> in <unk> .
That &apos;s how the future could start looking <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> the evolution of <unk> bacteria , <unk> , and finally , <unk> cells .
We are so <unk> to <unk> people .
Our goal is to do in a way of living long enough to try to <unk> . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the <unk> , some fundamental <unk> , of the new technology that we took to <unk> <unk> <unk> to a <unk> almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
It &apos;s a environment where you can <unk> is <unk> <unk> that you can <unk> with a huge amount of data <unk> .
And we &apos;re seeing here <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> and <unk> , for a fast <unk> , <unk> the images as we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much the amount of information that we see , how big these <unk> of data .
Most of them are common photographs , but this is a <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in any moment . It &apos;s also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a book entire , example of data not images .
This is the <unk> <unk> of <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And so , to <unk> that it &apos;s not the images and we can do something like that , to make a thing that &apos;s a real <unk> <unk> , not a picture .
It could be a little <unk> to read a book <unk> .
I don &apos;t <unk> it .
This is an example of the <unk> . It &apos;s a number of The <unk> .
Every big image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And I really really really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the real <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature of a <unk> .
We also did something with the corner of this <unk> number in particular <unk> .
We &apos;ve created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much higher than what you use in a normal <unk> , and we <unk> the content .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or even the <unk> <unk> .
And that really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the screen .
And I think that this <unk> <unk> <unk> and other <unk> <unk> , not to be <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this not to lose time , if not to say we have <unk> <unk> in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> over the <unk> of NASA .
So now I &apos;m going to try to do something else .
This is actually live on the Web ; you can see it .
It &apos;s a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> <unk> . A very interesting <unk> <unk> <unk> , a student of the Washington <unk> of Washington , with the help of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s live on the Web , <unk> <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of experience <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here actually has a meaning .
So , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , these pictures together , so that we &apos;re going to <unk> places that <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk> . Here you see some elements of a <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> to be all <unk> at the <unk> level .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of <unk> data and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that we &apos;ve done for the first time , for the summer , to show you what &apos;s really the key to show you what &apos;s really the key to show the <unk> that we put in the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and saying .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of kinds of <unk> and <unk> . And so on . <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> an image that has been discovered <unk> to this model .
So they &apos;re all <unk> <unk> and have all <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re all <unk> on the <unk> level like this .
And it &apos;s possible to <unk> this <unk> .
You know , I would never be thinking about working on <unk> .
It &apos;s very <unk> <unk> to <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think I &apos;m going to see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of <unk> : from those cell phones , a number <unk> , a number <unk> , <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I can go to look for those <unk> .
Many are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
<unk> here is a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from the <unk> to the physics of this environment .
The <unk> point is we can do things with social environment . This is now <unk> data from the whole memory of how to <unk> the Earth , from the <unk> view and <unk> all of the data together .
All those pictures become <unk> together , the greater than the <unk> .
You have a model of the entire Earth that &apos;s going to be <unk> .
Think about this as the <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> on Earth <unk> .
It &apos;s something that you &apos;re going to be <unk> as people who <unk> it , and the <unk> <unk> for who <unk> it with the use .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> by other people .
If somebody &apos;s idea of <unk> all of <unk> , all of these <unk> <unk> , my picture of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> all of that data , and I can use it as a <unk> to <unk> in that space , in that <unk> , using the pictures of anybody else , and have an experience social <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all that are very <unk> <unk> of every part of the Earth , <unk> not just by <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What &apos;s going on software ? What your software is going to be <unk> in the next few years , all the pictures <unk> from anybody in the entire world are <unk> <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is they &apos;re <unk> .
It &apos;s creating <unk> , if you want , in pictures .
And they &apos;re doing it in the <unk> of the pictures .
And the thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> information that a lot of these <unk> <unk> .
And as you do a <unk> <unk> on the Web , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the page , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , when you do a <unk> and the text on the page has a lot of <unk> about pictures .
Now , what happens if that picture is <unk> to all your pictures ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> <unk> that <unk> is really huge . It &apos;s a <unk> effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it &apos;s really incredible . <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> you very much .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> <unk> is the <unk> that we can live in the <unk> , which <unk> the past the wind , the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of plants .
And I think that the <unk> <unk> will be <unk> <unk> , or that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> still <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , and the idea that the <unk> of the <unk> , but it &apos;s just a model , actually , it &apos;s just a model , but it &apos;s just a model , reality ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , good or bad , a lot of <unk> .
And , of course , all of course , all the <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . Everybody <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
We need to <unk> the <unk> of death , so we don &apos;t want to be <unk> and <unk> --
We all have an art .
What <unk> is the particular <unk> of the song , the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that it &apos;s the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> .
He was my <unk> <unk> in the <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , on the <unk> , the mother of the world .
All of these <unk> are <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And if you <unk> a second , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of the world create a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and <unk> the planet , and it &apos;s important for the <unk> of the planet as <unk> <unk> .
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the total <unk> of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> to be from the human imagination of <unk> .
The <unk> is the fantastic <unk> of humanity .
It &apos;s the <unk> of what we can be and what we can be as <unk> species .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all the species was or is on the <unk> of the <unk> , because it &apos;s <unk> , or -- in the most <unk> -- in the <unk> of diversity -- and you don &apos;t even <unk> <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> of diversity .
The <unk> of all that is , obviously , the <unk> <unk> .
When you &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just <unk> by a <unk> or a series of rules .
One language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the <unk> <unk> that the <unk> of every culture is in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> , a thought , a <unk> of <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we &apos;re sitting here at least <unk> , at least half not is <unk> in the <unk> of children .
They &apos;re not <unk> to the children , the <unk> , which is <unk> not <unk> something , which they &apos;re already <unk> .
What is the most <unk> of being <unk> by the <unk> , of the last being the last one language , not to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of someone in the world every two weeks : every two weeks of every two weeks : every two weeks of a <unk> <unk> and <unk> with them in the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> .
And I know that somebody of you <unk> , &quot; <unk> &apos;t that ?
The world would not be a better place if we <unk> all the same language ? &quot; <unk> , then we talk all the time .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> of a <unk> thing that means that you can &apos;t speak your language .
And today I &apos;d like to show you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we &apos;re doing .
Many of us <unk> that when I say , &quot; different ways of <unk> . &quot; I mean different ways of <unk> .
And for example , this <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , which <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s not able to <unk> the blue color from green , because the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; You have to <unk> a different language .
And all this <unk> in the past <unk> , but the <unk> is that in these <unk> families , where you &apos;re talking about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> nobody <unk> .
You <unk> to listen and then I &apos;m going to talk about .
I <unk> one of the most interesting <unk> that I lived , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
They did <unk> by the <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> forest <unk> never saw anything .
They <unk> the pictures from the Earth , they <unk> the <unk> of a shape or a <unk> and , they didn &apos;t know anything , they <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with the <unk> .
But the <unk> don &apos;t just <unk> the <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> to them .
<unk> percent <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We &apos;re <unk> at eight <unk> and we found two cases of death and when we &apos;ve been <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was <unk> , and then they <unk> the same . And then they <unk> the same . And then they <unk> the same . They <unk> . And then they <unk> the same . And then they <unk> the same thing .
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species .
<unk> years old , I was really <unk> a really interesting task when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> between <unk> society and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And to make sense of <unk> , I should have to understand the <unk> culture , and the <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s pretty much a <unk> <unk> view of the world .
Very interesting .
If I &apos;m going to show you the big <unk> of the world , what do you want to <unk> me ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that <unk> <unk> Africa has no <unk> <unk> . And instead , and the <unk> is not more than the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
What makes interesting is that the <unk> is the <unk> of life and death .
So the <unk> do <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> to live in such a way that for a moment , the <unk> becomes the <unk> .
And that &apos;s why the <unk> <unk> <unk> , you go to <unk> to <unk> God .
We <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> God . &quot;
And since you &apos;re <unk> , is the spirit that you &apos;re <unk> , how do you <unk> ?
So , you start these incredible events : <unk> <unk> in the state of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I <unk> all the <unk> that I lived the most <unk> <unk> are the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that once you <unk> on the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> has never been <unk> by the <unk> .
And today I &apos;m <unk> by a <unk> , but their education is extraordinary <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> by <unk> families by <unk> , and they live <unk> in a world that <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> of nine years <unk> of the way to <unk> the nine months of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of mother , now I &apos;m <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
And for that time , they &apos;re <unk> to the values of their society , values that they <unk> their <unk> and just their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to better say , <unk> <unk> .
And at the end of this incredible <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> <unk> out and for the first time in their lives , at 18 years , see a <unk> . And in that moment of <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> , everything that they learned in <unk> theory , everything that they learned in the theory of <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and says ,
&quot; <unk> ? <unk> , how did I say .
It &apos;s <unk> . Now it &apos;s <unk> . Now it &apos;s <unk> .
They call <unk> <unk> big and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re the <unk> of the world .
This level of <unk> is very important .
When we think of the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> story , which is a <unk> <unk> in its <unk> or maybe <unk> and say that these <unk> are closer to Earth &apos;s Earth .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by the <unk> .
There &apos;s no <unk> for these things in the <unk> <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , but through the <unk> of the <unk> , but through the <unk> , they &apos;ve created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> . But on a <unk> <unk> <unk> : the concept that the Earth can only live because it &apos;s <unk> by human <unk> .
What does that mean ?
I mean that a <unk> <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> <unk> <unk> to be a human <unk> , and it will have a different relationship with the mountain or that place to be a different <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that a mountain is a <unk> to be <unk> .
That &apos;s a <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> is <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that the <unk> to be <unk> .
And that made me a human being different from my friends who believe that the <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> that live in the north of the world , <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> .
If I try to <unk> that these <unk> can actually create different , we &apos;re going to start understand some <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I <unk> this picture of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you may have heard about the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What makes fascinating is not the potential of the <unk> of the <unk> , but his <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> by two elements .
<unk> one side , this <unk> <unk> that <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> you have a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> with a <unk> &apos;s family <unk> <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you ever see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , the <unk> that they do from a different <unk> of species , <unk> it <unk> <unk> .
And I think that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . <unk> &apos;t creates a <unk> ; it creates a <unk> of reality , it &apos;s the reality of reality .
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk> , with his <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> my <unk> you can &apos;t tell me how you &apos;re going to <unk> because if you did you can &apos;t tell anybody to be <unk> . <unk> can &apos;t be <unk> <unk> because they &apos;re <unk> by a <unk> that &apos;s obviously in the <unk> , in the <unk> , <unk> .
It &apos;s possible to <unk> <unk> if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> .
Now it &apos;s the beauty : the <unk> that you find in this <unk> are <unk> , the same kind of <unk> <unk> , the same kind of <unk> <unk> . The question <unk> : in a <unk> of plants , how they do these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , they make two <unk> <unk> , they create a <unk> that , they create a <unk> that &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you <unk> to the <unk> , we &apos;re going to be <unk> .
What does that mean ?
This <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , who <unk> <unk> in the forest , and our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If you <unk> how to <unk> their <unk> <unk> us , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> of plants , you don &apos;t know everything ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take the <unk> <unk> in a <unk> of the moon and <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
And that &apos;s not <unk> you to <unk> , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , &#91; <unk> &#93; the problem is that even the ones that have to heart <unk> <unk> them <unk> , but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of history of the <unk> of our real world , and it <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , in 300 years , I didn &apos;t want to be <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk> , but rather like the was where we <unk> and <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> the <unk> of mass diversity and <unk> the planet &apos;s <unk> of the <unk> of the diversity and <unk> of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All the <unk> were <unk> in a new <unk> for life .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> don &apos;t have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> like this <unk> didn &apos;t have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s not the change or the technology that <unk> the <unk> . It &apos;s the power .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And if you look at a look at the world , you &apos;ll see that these are not <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of <unk> <unk> <unk> that go beyond their <unk> <unk> .
And I think you &apos;re <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> who lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where you can see the river from the <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> .
If we &apos;re <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the <unk> of politics .
As a <unk> , the <unk> of a <unk> , is <unk> at the <unk> level , but the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of life of a <unk> , not just is <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it &apos;s part of the development of the <unk> .
And you can &apos;t understand the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> until you part of the <unk> .
I <unk> miles from <unk> <unk> in China through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> <unk> <unk> , I just realized what behind the <unk> that I <unk> to talk about .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> <unk> .
That means that it &apos;s been <unk> to the Chinese time .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> who took the <unk> in <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and her <unk> was <unk> .
It was taken to <unk> <unk> at age of two <unk> under his <unk> because he couldn &apos;t live without having to live without him .
The <unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
One day he <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to work for seven years .
The pain of the <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> is by present .
And then , all <unk> to a choice .
Do you live in the <unk> world or <unk> we want to <unk> the world of diversity ?
The big <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died said that his greatest <unk> said that , in our <unk> <unk> of the world , not just <unk> the entire <unk> of the world , not just <unk> the entire <unk> of thinking , but one day , we <unk> us from a <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it &apos;s <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , who gave us <unk> <unk> , who made us <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has to <unk> 300 years .
That <unk> story , I didn &apos;t want to <unk> all the challenges that we &apos;re going to <unk> in the <unk> to come .
When these <unk> <unk> of the world is what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> <unk> different <unk> .
And that &apos;s in these answers that we all <unk> the possibilities of being what we are : a <unk> species , which has to <unk> that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are great moments of <unk> moments .
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> island , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> me , and this man , <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The <unk> government didn &apos;t always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> <unk> for our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
The family , <unk> for his life , the <unk> away all the <unk> , and all of his <unk> .
You want to know that <unk> don &apos;t <unk> the cold , you know .
The <unk> <unk> were made of fish .
The <unk> of this man didn &apos;t <unk> from the night or the <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> away , you know , you <unk> the <unk> skin and <unk> in your hand . When I did I <unk> them , <unk> them by creating a <unk> .
He &apos;s <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> created a <unk> , <unk> another dog , and it &apos;s <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> with nothing ? <unk> ? <unk> <unk> . And this , in different ways , <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> <unk> to <unk> the total <unk> of an area bigger <unk> of California and <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s their new <unk> . It &apos;s called <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> all the <unk> .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> at least <unk> at least who we &apos;ve been in these <unk> <unk> <unk> of the planet , <unk> that &apos;s not at all .
For somebody &apos;s house .
<unk> <unk> of human imagination that we <unk> to the <unk> of the time . And for us all , the dreams , the dreams , as the dreams , become part of the <unk> <unk> of hope .
And finally , we <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to anything .
I think the <unk> --
<unk> are not <unk> , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in the <unk> to bring our public places in places of <unk> <unk> <unk> by which they <unk> <unk> from how they saw and , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , for a <unk> <unk> , and we need to find a <unk> in a <unk> world , and we need to find a <unk> in the world , and we need to find a <unk> in a <unk> world .
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I &apos;m going to be <unk> <unk> <unk> , in case you &apos;ve already heard and <unk> some <unk> , in case you don &apos;t .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
What about what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> : &quot; If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens , &quot; The way to do it is to <unk> the freedom <unk> . &quot;
The reason is , on one side , in fact that the freedom is itself a value , is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> for humans .
And so , there &apos;s the fact that if we &apos;re <unk> , we &apos;re all <unk> to do everything that we <unk> our <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> no one that <unk> in our <unk> .
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> .
More choices , people have more <unk> , and more they are <unk> , and more they are the <unk> .
This , <unk> , is so <unk> <unk> in society that no one <unk> <unk> in society .
And it &apos;s also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you a few examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to take a simple note on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that no one of already <unk> in your <unk> .
That &apos;s what the <unk> is .
And then you go to the <unk> store for a <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there &apos;s a big number of <unk> <unk> .
We can do six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one <unk> .
<unk> <unk> there &apos;s <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a kid , you could get all the <unk> services , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the <unk> , you don &apos;t <unk> it .
A <unk> of that , one , was that the <unk> never <unk> .
These days they went .
We now have a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , especially in <unk> .
Here &apos;s cell phones of the future .
My <unk> is that in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
If you don &apos;t have seen it in the <unk> , you &apos;re very much <unk> .
And what happens to the end is that people come in the <unk> and they do this question . And you know , what &apos;s the answer is ? The answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , you <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : You don &apos;t happen in the United States that you &apos;re <unk> from the <unk> and the <unk> you have to do .
Instead , <unk> by the <unk> , and the <unk> says , &quot; OK , we could do it , or <unk> . &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> these and these <unk> , &quot; <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You <unk> them , &quot; <unk> , what do you do ? &quot;
And the <unk> says , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> and <unk> these <unk> . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; <unk> if she was me , what do you say ? &quot;
And the <unk> , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call it &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; , <unk> that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not a <unk> the weight and the responsibility for someone who knows something , <unk> the <unk> , to <unk> the other than that we don &apos;t know -- and almost certainly is <unk> -- and so it &apos;s not in the <unk> <unk> to make decisions , which is the patient .
There &apos;s a huge <unk> of products , <unk> to people like me and you , who if you think about it not makes sense , because we can &apos;t think about it .
But if we can &apos;t <unk> , why do we <unk> them ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> , we call the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
And so fundamental how we are now our <unk> now is a question of choice , as you see in this <unk> , &quot; We don &apos;t want to <unk> the kids . They want to be <unk> . &quot; We don &apos;t want to <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times we &apos;re <unk> .
That means that every <unk> , <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
And I was going to go to the family and <unk> , a time the common perspective , almost for anybody , was that <unk> you get the most <unk> soon , and you <unk> to <unk> them to be able to .
The only one real choice was with who , not when , and even what to do after that .
<unk> , all is really to play .
<unk> students , very smart students , and they <unk> them 20 percent less than a time .
And they &apos;re not because they &apos;re not <unk> , because they &apos;re <unk> .
But why are I <unk> , I &apos;m going to try to <unk> , &quot; <unk> or not ? <unk> do that now ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> later ? I have to think before or <unk> ? &quot;
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even though that <unk> doesn &apos;t <unk> the <unk> <unk> that <unk> and not get a good <unk> to my <unk> .
And they really have to do that . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the work : we &apos;re <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> , because the technology allows us to work every minute , from every day on the planet , <unk> that from the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> , and I &apos;m not going to tell anybody what the <unk> works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this incredible choice ? Is it incredible choice of choice ? Is it that we have to decide , <unk> at all time , if we &apos;re working or not .
We can go to see our son , and we can go to a <unk> , the <unk> in a <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> on the <unk> .
And even though they &apos;re all <unk> , every minute we see our <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re also <unk> , we &apos;re also trying to <unk> this ?
&quot; I have to <unk> this letter ? I have to <unk> this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , that &apos;s all of the experience of your <unk> very different than what it would be in other conditions .
So , from any of the things that you look at the little , things and <unk> of life , life is a question of choices .
And once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but not everything was a question of choice .
The world of today <unk> to this : <unk> is , &quot; Is it a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? &quot;
The answer is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> them all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to show this choice , two effects <unk> on people .
The first one , <unk> , is that it &apos;s <unk> instead of <unk> .
And so many <unk> between you , it &apos;s very difficult to do that .
I &apos;ll give you an example of <unk> : a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> has had access to the data <unk> , the <unk> society , <unk> <unk> society , with about a million <unk> <unk> in different <unk> <unk> .
What she found out is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> <unk> in more , the <unk> <unk> <unk> of two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s 10 percent <unk> <unk> than when they &apos;re only <unk> . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> <unk> between which , is it &apos;s very difficult to decide , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And <unk> , and again , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> <unk> , and of course , <unk> <unk> never <unk> .
And I think that &apos;s not just going to be <unk> <unk> <unk> , because they don &apos;t have enough money , it &apos;s so <unk> that we &apos;re also <unk> <unk> <unk> of the work .
They &apos;re not going to be <unk> until five <unk> per year from the <unk> of work , which would be <unk> to <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices .
And I think that I &apos;m going to <unk> the world like this .
&quot; And to end , for the <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
They &apos;re really going to make the right decision , if it &apos;s for the <unk> , right ?
You don &apos;t want to pick the wrong , and you <unk> the wrong <unk> .
So that &apos;s the first effect . The second is that even though we can <unk> the <unk> and make a choice , at the end , we &apos;re less <unk> by the result of how we were <unk> with less <unk> than the result .
And that &apos;s different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of <unk> between , and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy , to imagine that we could do a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the decision , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the decision ,
even when it was a decision .
More choices there are , it &apos;s easy to <unk> than any <unk> that it &apos;s <unk> .
<unk> , there &apos;s what <unk> call them <unk> .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well to <unk> how the value we value to <unk> things from what we &apos;re <unk> .
And then , when there are so many <unk> you can , it &apos;s easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> that &apos;s choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m not in the <unk> of all of the ones that I &apos;m not in New York .
But that &apos;s probably going to happen .
There &apos;s this <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> place .
<unk> <unk> . It &apos;s all about it . It &apos;s all for them .
I don &apos;t know . But what he thinks he &apos;s thinking is , &quot; Well , <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; All my <unk> <unk> are away . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> right in front of home . &quot;
And it <unk> two weeks <unk> from the idea that it &apos;s <unk> -- every day -- the possibility of <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the more of the <unk> we have <unk> , the more the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> how to <unk> .
Here &apos;s another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot .
It &apos;s about living the moment , and maybe it &apos;s going to live on .
But the most important point is that anything you want , you &apos;re <unk> , you &apos;re not going to be able to do other .
The things that they don &apos;t <unk> so many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a couple of <unk> .
It &apos;s almost always <unk> .
And once the <unk> were just one kind of <unk> , <unk> them and <unk> <unk> , they were <unk> , only after they had to <unk> a whole bunch of times , <unk> to go well .
So , I started <unk> a couple of new when they were <unk> , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . &quot;
And the <unk> said , &quot; Do you want to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
Do you want them to <unk> or with <unk> ? &quot; <unk> &quot;
&quot; Do you want to <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- &quot; <unk> <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a little bit , I could say , &quot; I want the guy -- which was the only guy . &quot; He didn &apos;t have any idea what it was , so for a time . I was all <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then <unk> from the <unk> , <unk> , with the best couple of <unk> that I had ever had .
It was the <unk> . With all that choice I had to <unk> the best .
But I &apos;ll get worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to <unk> .
The reason I was that I was worse with all that choice , my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I was <unk> <unk> . I didn &apos;t want to <unk> when I was just one guy , but when I was going to do that , at least one of them had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After I <unk> that I was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in life of people don &apos;t do that <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> same .
And this is less <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of <unk> , it &apos;s got to do .
Because if I <unk> it , I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more about that .
&quot; He was better when he was doing that when he was worse , he was when he was worse was when he was worse was <unk> .
<unk> , in the world we live in -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that the things are at the <unk> .
You &apos;ve never been <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you &apos;re here is , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; Yes , you want to do that . &quot;
I mean -- little <unk> moment -- that I &apos;m really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn &apos;t do that , I didn &apos;t <unk> .
But <unk> is not always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> a couple of <unk> <unk> when there &apos;s only that kind of <unk> is that when you &apos;re not <unk> , and you &apos;re <unk> , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who &apos;s <unk> ? &quot; <unk> , the answer is <unk> .
The world is the <unk> . What do I do we do ?
When there are hundreds of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> , and you &apos;ll see who &apos;s the <unk> , and you &apos;ll see who &apos;s the <unk> , is clear that the <unk> you are .
We could have to do better .
With hundreds of <unk> <unk> , there are no <unk> for the <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even if the result is <unk> , they <unk> <unk> and they give them to them themselves .
In the last few years , the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only one , but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is just that people have experiences because the standard are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation they think that they &apos;re <unk> .
So the final result is that in general we &apos;re better , <unk> , but we &apos;re going to do worse .
Let me show you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all do for good and it &apos;s completely <unk> . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no <unk> that a little bit better than that we don &apos;t want to <unk> at all , but it &apos;s not going to be a lot better choice than a little bit .
There &apos;s a <unk> value , <unk> . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure that we &apos;ve <unk> from a piece of the level that the choices that the <unk> choices we have .
Now , from the <unk> <unk> -- I &apos;ve almost finished -- from the <unk> point of view , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What it allows all this choice in <unk> society is the <unk> .
There are many places in the world , and you &apos;re going to be <unk> , where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice .
The problem is that they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I &apos;m talking about is a <unk> <unk> , <unk> society .
And what it does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> has talked about yesterday about how <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> are <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> of money .
I mean these choices , <unk> and <unk> , not is that they are <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
They do us to be worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows us to be <unk> in those where people have too few <unk> , not just be <unk> in those where people have too few <unk> , but also our .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of the income is good at all -- not just to the poor -- not just to the poor people -- not just to the poor --
And to end , &quot; <unk> , you can become everything you want , &quot;
<unk> , people of culture , <unk> , &quot; What are you going to do that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s <unk> that you can &apos;t get into a glass . &quot;
&quot; A <unk> imagination , a <unk> view of the world --
and I <unk> it like this , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I realized that fish <unk> know that fish know , the <unk> knows that fish know .
Because the reality of <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk> , so that , &quot; everything is possible . &quot; You don &apos;t <unk> freedom . &quot;
If you <unk> the <unk> so that you can <unk> the <unk> .
I <unk> the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
They all need a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for the <unk> .
Thank you very much .
