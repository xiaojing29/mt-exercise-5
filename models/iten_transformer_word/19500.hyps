<unk> year I showed these <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years , had the size of the United States <unk> , is <unk> of the United States , is <unk> of 40 percent .
We <unk> this <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a way , the heart <unk> of climate system .
It <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You can see , you know , they <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That &apos;s the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> of summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , of five years or more , it &apos;s like blood , that you &apos;re <unk> from the body .
It &apos;s 25 years of the past , so .
This is a problem because the <unk> is <unk> <unk> around the <unk> <unk> around the <unk> <unk> , where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> , are <unk> , are <unk> in <unk> by the <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the amount of <unk> <unk> , the amount of <unk> , <unk> this point of not <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> in <unk> the <unk> is already <unk> from the water .
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> was <unk> with a <unk> last <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : She &apos;s fine . The question is if we do it .
One reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the north .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> had never <unk> like that .
This is the <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how the <unk> level of the sea <unk> on <unk> , here &apos;s where the sea the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> on the planet : <unk> , the biggest <unk> of the planet .
<unk> month scientists have <unk> that the ice <unk> is in <unk> , and that the Western <unk> , which <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> at six feet of the <unk> of <unk> , like in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the biggest <unk> of ice , you see some new <unk> , which few years ago were <unk> .
40 percent of the world population <unk> half of <unk> water from the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : this <unk> is the source of <unk> <unk> of this city .
The <unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same happens to <unk> water .
In California <unk> on the <unk> <unk> is <unk> of 40 percent .
<unk> <unk> are in crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they &apos;re <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in the world is <unk> to a <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> to a normal , <unk> out of the normal and without <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years of <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> .
If you look at it in the <unk> context if they can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we &apos;ve <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every day .
Look at the area of the <unk> <unk> , from <unk> , to <unk> , and on both of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> oxygen in the ocean .
The biggest cause of global warming , together to <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of two countries with more emissions , with China .
And they <unk> to build many other <unk> <unk> .
But we &apos;re <unk> to a <unk> of direction .
These are the <unk> projects over the last few years and some <unk> <unk> .
Every way , there &apos;s a political <unk> in our country .
<unk> of <unk> and oil have <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I <unk> image something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it on the <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> in America .
It &apos;s <unk> around <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> of the <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> â™« <unk> <unk> is a <unk> kind of happy and happy .
It &apos;s <unk> here in America , and grow our economy .
<unk> the <unk> is <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
Al <unk> : <unk> here is a lot of <unk> <unk> .
The biggest society <unk> on the <unk> <unk> is <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al <unk> : So <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , one part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> , we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> of our business .
For that our <unk> is <unk> a lot of money in a <unk> <unk> to public and <unk> the truth about <unk> .
It &apos;s actually not <unk> .
We think it &apos;s <unk> -- it &apos;s also a good <unk> .
So , we don &apos;t <unk> of climate change .
We can do it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you &apos;ve heard about it very much .
So , we &apos;re going to <unk> a <unk> structure as a <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> are a little <unk> , but this is the sound of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is between global warming <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> technology that you see changes everything .
And let &apos;s look at this : this is the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Al <unk> : <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> issue and the national security .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> is in the crisis ; the <unk> , national security , the <unk> crisis .
The <unk> that all the <unk> of : our <unk> <unk> <unk> and oil .
Now , though , there &apos;s a new solution , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A <unk> for <unk> to work , <unk> more <unk> , and helping to <unk> the global warming .
<unk> , a solution that we can solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
<unk> : This is the last one .
<unk> : <unk> : It &apos;s about <unk> energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> , at the end of the <unk> of the <unk> that we &apos;re going to be our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , sun , a new <unk> network .
<unk> <unk> 2 : <unk> <unk> for jobs well .
<unk> : <unk> America . It &apos;s time to be <unk> .
Al <unk> : A <unk> <unk> <unk> says , &quot; If you want to go for yourself .
If you want to go far , you go . &quot;
We have to go very quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED I made a <unk> on <unk> .
And I try to <unk> to <unk> how the machine works .
So , here we go . And for the people who were the <unk> was the biggest scientific experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were in less than a <unk> of the second universe -- until <unk> million times a second .
All of this is simply <unk> .
This is the <unk> machine .
We <unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk> .
This is what I work on . It &apos;s called <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> feet and it &apos;s a <unk> of <unk> .
This is a <unk> picture of <unk> in construction . And you can see the <unk> .
The 10 <unk> of the last year we <unk> the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> of particles that had done all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles inside the <unk> .
In other words , when you <unk> that image the <unk> , the machine that the <unk> , the machine that &apos;s <unk> , which is a great <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if that was to make us <unk> more or this , when somebody <unk> on Google and they <unk> that the <unk> page was this .
That means we have had a <unk> impact on the scientific .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to just these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine works at the <unk> of <unk> .
Now , the <unk> of you <unk> the <unk> and <unk> , &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot;
And they can do it because when they &apos;re very <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees <unk> , to the <unk> of the space between stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> of the most <unk> <unk> in <unk> , there was a <unk> of <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a electric <unk> .
That was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and that they &apos;re <unk> about 30 <unk> .
It &apos;s about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
They &apos;re now <unk> everybody to their <unk> place .
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the new <unk> .
We <unk> it , and we &apos;ll try to get data to <unk> or <unk> , and continue so our <unk> to find out what the <unk> that <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering to <unk> . It &apos;s easy to <unk> .
I think that &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s so hard , I think that &apos;s the value of things like <unk> .
I want to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which , in <unk> <unk> of <unk> experiments of his <unk> , his <unk> was Michael <unk> , said , &quot; No is so <unk> to the progress of human mind how <unk> that ideas of science are <unk> , that there are no <unk> in nature , that our <unk> are <unk> , and that our <unk> are <unk> , and that are not <unk> .
Thank you .
I want to <unk> you to <unk> when , from children , <unk> with <unk> .
As we &apos;re <unk> as <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , in fact , to think and solve <unk> problems and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way most of the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects , with my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started to <unk> , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having a computer , instead of having the digital <unk> of the <unk> <unk> as a digital <unk> that moves on a digital <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> a information with both hands ,
and we &apos;re going to <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that we tried to explore the answer , building the <unk> .
In a <unk> words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
In a <unk> words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , they can <unk> <unk> with their movement and they have a screen and they have a screen and they have a <unk> radio .
But <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> digital information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement of others , and as they become <unk> , <unk> of the movement of the <unk> of the movement , of the other , of how we <unk> them , we can explore new new and <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
I &apos;ll start with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you of the video -- if you put it in a direction , the <unk> video so , if we go to the other side back .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> .
If you <unk> them , they &apos;re <unk> to what they &apos;re doing around them .
If they &apos;re <unk> , they can <unk> and they can <unk> a little bit .
If they &apos;re <unk> , they can <unk> and they can <unk> a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We were then we realized that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of data , for example , &quot; <unk> , &quot; a color like it .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as <unk> of <unk> and I can <unk> for the color in that central , where they <unk> .
and I can <unk> for the color in that central to the central color , where they <unk> .
If we <unk> too much , we can <unk> a little bit .
There are also <unk> possibility of <unk> , like <unk> , math and <unk> games where people can try things very quickly , and they <unk> the results immediately .
I &apos;m now --
This is a <unk> <unk> that I do with a <unk> <unk> program .
Here we have a game of words that is in half between <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> , a letter to <unk> on every <unk> , <unk> , at every <unk> , <unk> a letter to <unk> , and as we <unk> of <unk> words , he <unk> on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you &apos;ve got a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try to do .
Thank you .
There are some kids who are <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> , I did so that I <unk> them and I <unk> a video .
They &apos;re very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things like this <unk> is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just wanted to say , &quot; <unk> of words , &quot; and they know what to do .
There &apos;s other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , there on the right .
It really wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
We want to build a tool for <unk> . He &apos;s <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So , it &apos;s <unk> out .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now he took a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> work ! Yeah ! Yeah !
So , <unk> <unk> and <unk> can make the characters and <unk> can make the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
-- <unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It &apos;s a <unk> story with open , and it can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : It &apos;s a <unk> story with open , and it can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time to show you is a tool that I was doing , by recently , to <unk> and music .
It &apos;s a tool that we did , to <unk> and <unk> music .
The <unk> here is <unk> as <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of these has four different <unk> , and you can choose what we use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> sequence .
And we just <unk> by doing a <unk> sound and a sequence .
These are effects that you can control live , like <unk> and <unk> .
We &apos;ll be able to see it with a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are the <unk> effects of how time and <unk> , which is <unk> to the whole sequence .
<unk> how it works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> a <unk> in two <unk> <unk> &quot; sequence , &quot; <unk> in a series , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , on the other <unk> .
Now , we &apos;re going to <unk> a <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : Now let me <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> : And now I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , so I can control the <unk> effect alive .
<unk> : I can <unk> the entire sequence of time from one side or the other .
<unk> : <unk> : And now we &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> to give more <unk> .
<unk> : I can <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
So I don &apos;t have to tell you about it before , but I can <unk> , <unk> long , <unk> .
And now , finally I can <unk> the entire sequence on the left the <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> more and more <unk> to how our brain work and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibilities we &apos;re trying to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to <unk> is that it &apos;s <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> , that information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time of talking to all of you .
I &apos;m a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the <unk> of my life .
And it doesn &apos;t look like me that we can change .
But , this particular , something that happened was <unk> in my life and in my career , which has led me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I wrote this book , this <unk> called &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which , <unk> , &quot; which , <unk> from my books , for some reason to <unk> <unk> in the world and <unk> a great , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere we are now , people like I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I &apos;m going to be <unk> now and say , &quot; You don &apos;t <unk> to be able to be able to do better ?
You don &apos;t have to be <unk> to write for all life without being able to create a book that can <unk> someone to be able to do someone ? &quot;
How can you get to someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> , you know .
But it could be worse , except I remember that over 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a <unk> -- that I wanted to be a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to be <unk> to the same <unk> <unk> .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you know that you can &apos;t have to be <unk> ?
Do you don &apos;t fear the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> you ?
Do you don &apos;t fear of doing this <unk> for all life without any of life that nothing is going to be <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> dreams of <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> ?
So , you know .
The short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I &apos;m afraid of all of that .
I &apos;ve always <unk> .
And I also <unk> of many other things that people can &apos;t <unk> .
Like <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as I think , and I was <unk> to write what I thought and <unk> <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It &apos;s <unk> that anybody who <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel to do .
But what &apos;s so particular about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not do ?
How do my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I don &apos;t remember one time in his <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> ?
It never -- that <unk> of <unk> John <unk> , how did it go ?
Don &apos;t you like that , <unk> ?
<unk> , the engineers <unk> as a group of <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
We have enough , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> but <unk> of all sorts of things , we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk> .
And not even though , looking at the <unk> <unk> of the dead <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often to do their own .
And even the people who don &apos;t seem to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before they die in the last <unk> said , &quot; Every my book <unk> me a little more <unk> . &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> about work .
But we don &apos;t know , when we say we &apos;ve heard these things so long , in some ways we have completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and the art , at the end , <unk> , at the end , <unk> , <unk> always <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> everybody here today is : you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s good for nothing -- because it &apos;s <unk> from a <unk> distance to me .
I think it &apos;s <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s also <unk> , and I don &apos;t want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better <unk> our <unk> to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I &apos;m in my career .
<unk> -- <unk> look , they &apos;re quite young , I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;m quite <unk> .
I &apos;ve got about four <unk> of work in me .
And it &apos;s very <unk> that any <unk> of the world as the work that we &apos;re going to be <unk> by the world as the work that <unk> after the last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we &apos;re all <unk> friends here -- is <unk> that my biggest <unk> is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , what thinking !
You know , this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start <unk> <unk> to nine in the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I could continue doing this work that I love .
So the question becomes , how ?
And so I think , after many <unk> , that the way to work to keep writing is that to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to have a <unk> distance between me , which I &apos;m <unk> , and my natural <unk> on what the <unk> <unk> <unk> on what the <unk> <unk> <unk> on what that <unk> <unk> <unk> do to look at the time , looking through the <unk> of the best ideas and more <unk> .
as to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research led me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s because they <unk> in <unk> and then they go back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don &apos;t believe that <unk> creativity from men , OK ?
It turns out that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk> for <unk> reasons .
The <unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity <unk> <unk> of creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
The <unk> were the same idea , but they <unk> that kind of spirit without a <unk> .
which is <unk> , because the <unk> doesn &apos;t really really really <unk> to be a <unk> someone .
And we thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> literally in the <unk> of a artist &apos;s study , a while the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> out of <unk> to the work of the artist and <unk> the work of that .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , that &apos;s the distance I &apos;m talking about -- that <unk> <unk> you from the results of your work .
And everybody <unk> that it was so that we were <unk> , right ?
So the <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like the too <unk> , right ?
If your work was <unk> <unk> , you &apos;re all <unk> that you &apos;re going to be <unk> by this <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it was not your <unk> , right ?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people are <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and everything <unk> , and we <unk> this great idea . We put the human being at the center of the universe , and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and people started to think that <unk> creativity is completely from <unk> .
And for the first time in history , it &apos;s <unk> to <unk> to this or that artist as a <unk> to a person with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think that was a big <unk> .
I think we &apos;re going to be a simple person to believe that I was like a source , like <unk> , <unk> and <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a responsibility to <unk> too much to give to human <unk> .
It &apos;s like to ask someone to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> the <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think that &apos;s the pressure of <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years .
And if that &apos;s true , and I think that &apos;s , the question is , the question is , right now ?
Can we do it ?
I want to go back to a more <unk> understanding of human relationship and <unk> <unk> .
or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t do it for 500 years of <unk> thinking in a <unk> <unk> .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , do you do people <unk> <unk> of <unk> on their projects .
You probably don &apos;t all <unk> on this .
But the question I want to <unk> you is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t we do it in this way ?
Because more sense of everything that I &apos;ve ever heard to explain the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> process .
A process that , as anybody who ever <unk> to do something -- so basically , everybody here -- knows , you know , you don &apos;t know <unk> .
And , in fact , it can sometimes look like <unk> .
I &apos;ve been doing this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s now 90 years , but who was a <unk> for all life and said that during his <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> , and I <unk> it , inside the <unk> <unk> .
He said that he was like a <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> to her <unk> to her .
The <unk> <unk> to come , because he <unk> the Earth under his feet .
I decided to have one thing to do to that point and was to , he <unk> as a <unk> . &quot;
And so he went back home and he was <unk> by this <unk> , and he wouldn &apos;t have anything else to take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough to the page , and they were <unk> and <unk> on the page .
<unk> times it doesn &apos;t <unk> to be <unk> , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> through her <unk> and she would <unk> her <unk> through and she would <unk> them to <unk> through the <unk> , looking , looking , and he would be <unk> through the <unk> , looking , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this piece of paper never -- there were times when the was about <unk> , OK ?
So , he was <unk> at home and he was looking for paper and <unk> her <unk> through , and then he was <unk> , and then he was <unk> , and then he said , that he was like if he <unk> with the other hand and <unk> .
It <unk> the <unk> from the tail and <unk> into his body and <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the page <unk> and <unk> , but <unk> , <unk> , from the last word to the first word .
So when I <unk> <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not all my <unk> process -- I &apos;m not a <unk> .
I &apos;m a <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> to the same <unk> every day and <unk> and work and <unk> and work <unk> above .
But even I , in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I &apos;ll think that many of you do that .
You know , even if the work and ideas <unk> me <unk> from a certain source I could not <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it to it <unk> to us to <unk> our head , but rather , what do you like to do it ?
As a <unk> , the best example of <unk> that I have <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;ve <unk> different years ago for a <unk> .
<unk> of this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the artist <unk> <unk> <unk> , trying to control , these species of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then he <unk> , he <unk> , and he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> it all for him .
<unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s all of a <unk> <unk> , that comes in his head as <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , you know , and she wants , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and <unk> , but it doesn &apos;t know how to <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
So he starts to hear this kind of old <unk> <unk> in him like , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose it from this <unk> song .
I &apos;m not <unk> enough , and I can &apos;t <unk> . &quot;
And instead of going to <unk> , they <unk> .
<unk> the whole <unk> process and made something completely new .
I just wanted the sky and said , &quot; <unk> , you don &apos;t see I &apos;m <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Do it seem to write a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you &apos;re going to be <unk> when I can take care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> more <unk> today .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And his <unk> process <unk> <unk> after that .
It wasn &apos;t work , it was still <unk> as always as .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he was <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that out of him <unk> <unk> , the <unk> that he <unk> that he had to be <unk> <unk> , where he was <unk> , he didn &apos;t have to be a <unk> and <unk> .
but I was <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> <unk> and this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and this <unk> thing that was , and it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
So how much that story we &apos;re going to change a little bit , even the way I &apos;m going to <unk> and I already <unk> once .
This idea , I &apos;m <unk> when I was <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; and <unk> in one of the <unk> of the <unk> that we &apos;re working on something and we don &apos;t , and we can &apos;t , and you start to think that it will be a <unk> , that &apos;s going to be a <unk> , that &apos;s going to be the <unk> book , and we &apos;re going to think that it will ever be a <unk> book ,
Not only <unk> , the <unk> book .
And we started to think of <unk> this project .
But then I &apos;m going to <unk> to <unk> air and <unk> .
So I <unk> my face on <unk> and <unk> my face to a <unk> corner of the room .
And I said <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , what , both of the <unk> book , and that if this book is not going to be <unk> , right ?
Because as I see I &apos;m going to <unk> everything I have , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , I don &apos;t do anything .
I started writing the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I would like to please , that it was <unk> that I &apos;ve been <unk> to do my part . &quot; Because I mean , it &apos;s like , OK , let &apos;s do in the <unk> of Africa , the people <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the moon , <unk> music that I will go to the moon , and the <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every while , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> .
And I know you know what I do , because I know you &apos;ve all , at some point , at some point , like that .
It was as if time <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it was doing nothing different from the usually , like <unk> <unk> <unk> before , but everything <unk> .
And all of a sudden , not just as a human just .
But it <unk> from <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , the <unk> with his name .
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , &quot; God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; to &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which you can hear in <unk> or in <unk> .
In <unk> , when a artist did something impossible and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
And it &apos;s <unk> because we need it .
But the problem comes the day , the problem comes the next day , the <unk> and <unk> <unk> that are <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> God &apos;s no more .
It &apos;s just a <unk> with a lot of <unk> to <unk> , and maybe not <unk> to that <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God &apos;s even as I &apos;m going to be doing the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so <unk> if you can &apos;t believe , <unk> , <unk> , the most <unk> of your being are being being from you .
But let me just show you that data in <unk> from a <unk> source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk> when you &apos;re done .
And , you know , if we think it all changes .
And so I started <unk> , and it &apos;s certainly how I <unk> it for several months during the <unk> of the book that I was <unk> soon , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of my
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , not fear .
Don &apos;t worry . You just your work .
<unk> to <unk> for your part , any way , it can be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , you will be <unk> to you to <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for one moment through your <unk> , then &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
<unk> , you do the same <unk> .
And &quot; <unk> ! &quot; to yourself .
I think and I think it &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; to yourself , even for <unk> love and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects about the human genome , about what <unk> can <unk> and discovery of genes .
We &apos;re now <unk> a new path : we &apos;ve started <unk> the biology and now starting to <unk> the digital code of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We have <unk> <unk> of <unk> questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; is something that many <unk> I think they have <unk> to understand various levels .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> for almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go from the <unk> world of the digital world of computer biology .
Now we &apos;re <unk> : we can <unk> life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> <unk> species , which is the <unk> <unk> species of the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to make a little more small .
We &apos;re able to <unk> a <unk> of genes about 500 or so that I &apos;m here .
But when we take a look at his <unk> map , it &apos;s <unk> simple than our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at a time , it &apos;s very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell .
So , we thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> <unk> so that we could <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these <unk> questions .
And so we started the <unk> of &quot; <unk> a <unk> ? &quot;
Can we create these big molecules that we &apos;ve never done to create before ?
And , in <unk> <unk> , can we make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The speed with which we &apos;re able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> <unk> the code , instead of <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> .
And our most <unk> results bring on a <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> many <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before experiments .
But we &apos;ve found that DNA <unk> is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA <unk> , of 30 to 50 <unk> and it &apos;s a <unk> process . <unk> is the <unk> of it , the more <unk> is there .
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , starting to <unk> <unk> information <unk> .
It &apos;s a little virus that <unk> bacteria .
We designed <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> about <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> it in bacteria , and they <unk> the <unk> particles .
<unk> particles have been there are <unk> by cells , they &apos;re <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ve talked about recently with <unk> <unk> industry that they &apos;ve talked about this model .
They have more than you .
And we think this is a situation where software really can build its own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we could do the bigger things .
We had to build the entire <unk> of <unk> .
They are more than <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we thought we &apos;re <unk> in the size of the virus , so we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if we <unk> with <unk> information in a computer , these must be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> the <unk> <unk> was of a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve found , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If we wanted to use that original sequence never <unk> to do it .
One of the process is design <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build <unk> <unk> to build smaller <unk> than <unk> .
<unk> <unk> elements here .
You &apos;ve probably read that you &apos;ve seen <unk> .
So , we have a <unk> code on four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about 20 <unk> , and there &apos;s a <unk> order to <unk> .
So we can use the code for writing words , <unk> , <unk> .
So what we did at the beginning was <unk> .
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> <unk> .
And we started <unk> with parts , <unk> with <unk> from five to seven <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to them to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
At every step we <unk> these <unk> in <unk> so that we &apos;re trying to create a extremely <unk> <unk> as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to <unk> the process .
So , this seems a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When we start these <unk> much <unk> , more than 100 <unk> <unk> <unk> , no more directly to the <unk> <unk> .
It comes to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> biology .
So we have <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> is <unk> .
In 12 hours , they &apos;re <unk> exactly as it was before .
<unk> of thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can completely <unk> .
We have to live under <unk> .
They &apos;re absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and they &apos;re <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
Actually , NASA has shown that this happens .
This is a picture of the <unk> we built by using these <unk> , just using the <unk> design with the <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This picture wasn &apos;t <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s so big , we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we &apos;ve done a little time ago .
They are more than <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s the biggest of a <unk> structure ever <unk> by human <unk> .
It has a <unk> weight <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a 10 <unk> without spaces , we &apos;ll just <unk> pages to <unk> this <unk> code .
Now , how do we make it work ?
Of course , with a virus is a <unk> game .
It &apos;s a little bit more <unk> when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s more simple when it comes to <unk> cells like our : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the <unk> process .
In <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> in the cell , but we have <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re able to do a <unk> of a <unk> from a cell to another and of <unk> .
We have <unk> a <unk> from a <unk> species .
The two are different than men are <unk> .
We &apos;ve <unk> some <unk> more <unk> so that we could decide what you to choose to <unk> to <unk> .
He &apos;s got <unk> with the <unk> so that we <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> went into the cell .
And we would say , we don &apos;t want to go beyond , but we tried to <unk> it more in there .
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution .
We &apos;ve found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So who thinks about evolution as a only <unk> at a time that <unk> doesn &apos;t really understand much of biology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> DNA .
The <unk> that was in the cell didn &apos;t <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> we <unk> it .
It &apos;s <unk> , and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> , he <unk> it , and he <unk> it , and we <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk> .
It &apos;s become blue <unk> to the genes we &apos;ve <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species , you go to the <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> of all in a new species , <unk> on the new software that we &apos;ve <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code that exactly what we &apos;ve <unk> .
Now , this may seem <unk> <unk> , but we can <unk> the software , we can change things in a fairly <unk> <unk> .
Now , I &apos;ve already <unk> that you &apos;re not talking about <unk> -- but about progress from three million years and a half million years of evolution , and I &apos;ve already said that maybe we &apos;re creating a new version of the <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re going to create a new <unk> <unk> <unk> new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> when we think of our <unk> .
We &apos;re going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give you an example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in <unk> ; in <unk> , in 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re <unk> problems now to find food , water and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> for six and a half billion people .
We &apos;re going to be even more <unk> it for nine billion .
We &apos;re more than five billion <unk> , over 30 billion <unk> .
That means 100 million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process to <unk> , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
In more we have to realize that we have to <unk> of the entire CO2 <unk> from these materials that we &apos;re <unk> in the atmosphere .
At the day of today , because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> all over the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that &apos;s the <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> only a <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from reality and our imagination .
We now have <unk> , because we have these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think of these 20 million genes , we can <unk> to <unk> <unk> or <unk> to <unk> the <unk> to produce or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology than in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard <unk> .
We can choose for the possibility of <unk> , chemistry or chemistry or <unk> <unk> , or chemistry , <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software that we &apos;re working on to be able to <unk> and design species to computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how to be .
We know exactly how their <unk> code .
We &apos;re now <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
You &apos;ve seen that <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We have <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a great <unk> <unk> to <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> CO2 in matter and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> CO2 in the first place , and we &apos;re working on to design , and we think we &apos;re working on to design this , and we think we &apos;re going to be able to be <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> solar <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> we <unk> in <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> in the deep ocean , about <unk> feet deep to the temperature of water .
We &apos;re <unk> by <unk> <unk> , using <unk> as energy as energy as .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2 , that can easily be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to <unk> this process .
So , in short , we think we might be able to <unk> what the question of the basic question of what is . We have the <unk> goal of <unk> <unk> the entire industry .
<unk> . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you ?
It <unk> a major source of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working for using the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk> .
You &apos;ve seen this year with flu , we always go back a year and with a dollar less when it &apos;s about finding the right <unk> .
I think that you can change building <unk> in <unk> .
That &apos;s how the future could start to look <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> the evolution with <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and finally cells .
We &apos;re so so much better people to <unk> .
Our goal is to do a way to live long enough to try to <unk> . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the <unk> <unk> possible , some <unk> work , the new technology that we took to the <unk> <unk> <unk> to a year ago exactly . This is <unk> .
It &apos;s a environment where you can <unk> is at the local level that you can <unk> with a huge amount of data <unk> .
Here we &apos;re seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a <unk> <unk> , <unk> images like we want to do it .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much we see , how much of information we see , how big these <unk> of data or images .
Most of them are common photographs , but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen . It &apos;s also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a book whole , which is not a <unk> of images .
This is the <unk> <unk> of <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And we can do this , to <unk> that it &apos;s just about images and not to do something like that , to actually see that it &apos;s a real <unk> <unk> , not a picture .
It could be a way to read a little bit of a <unk> book .
I don &apos;t <unk> it .
This is a more <unk> . It &apos;s a more <unk> example .
Each of the big image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the <unk> experience to read the real <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a kind of <unk> .
We also did something with the corner of the <unk> of the <unk> .
We &apos;ve created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much higher than the one you use in a normal <unk> , and we <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even the <unk> <unk> .
And that really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
We think this is going to put the <unk> and other <unk> <unk> , not to be <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say we have <unk> to give us , and we have <unk> <unk> in this field .
These are all the <unk> in the U.S. <unk> .
So now I &apos;ll go to something else .
This is actually live on the Web ; you can see it .
It &apos;s a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> student of <unk> <unk> , a student of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s live on the web , <unk> by <unk> .
You can see when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can move from an image to another , and have this kind of experience to <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of images here actually actually has meaning .
So , the <unk> of <unk> of the computer <unk> have <unk> these images together , so that we <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk> . So you see some <unk> of a <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> , and these things were all <unk> <unk> , and these things were all <unk> <unk> , and these things were all <unk> at the <unk> level .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of <unk> data and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that we &apos;ve done for the first summer to show you what &apos;s really the key to the summer of <unk> to show what &apos;s really the key to this technology , the <unk> technology , the <unk> . And that &apos;s not so <unk> <unk> look at the <unk> that we &apos;ve done in the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> <unk> and so on .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> images of types of kinds of <unk> , and so on . <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> an image that &apos;s image <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s a picture that &apos;s actually <unk> to this model .
So they &apos;re all <unk> <unk> and have been all <unk> at the <unk> level in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to <unk> in this <unk> way .
You know , I would never thought of <unk> to work for <unk> .
It &apos;s very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think we &apos;ll see that it &apos;s a lot of different kinds of <unk> : from the cell phones to those cell phones <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I can , I can try to get those <unk> .
Many are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
<unk> there is a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from <unk> to the physics of this environment .
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now <unk> data from the whole memory of how we <unk> the Earth , from the whole <unk> of how the Earth the <unk> <unk> and <unk> all those data together .
All of the pictures become <unk> together , greater than the <unk> of the parts .
You have a model of the entire <unk> that <unk> .
Think about this as a <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> on Earth .
It &apos;s something that we &apos;re <unk> in complexity as people <unk> it , and the <unk> that we &apos;re <unk> for the people to <unk> it with use .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people .
If somebody comes the idea of <unk> , all these <unk> <unk> the name of <unk> <unk> <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> of all these data , and I can use it as a <unk> to <unk> in the space , in that <unk> , using the pictures of everybody else , and have a social <unk> like <unk> and <unk> .
Now , a <unk> of this is , of course , <unk> of this , is extremely <unk> of every interesting of the Earth , <unk> not only to <unk> <unk> and <unk> images .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand good ? What &apos;s the software is going to <unk> us to do is that at some point in the next few years , all the <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the next <unk> , all of the <unk> <unk> , are going to be <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is we &apos;re <unk> to find .
It &apos;s creating <unk> , if you want , you want , between images .
And he &apos;s doing it in the <unk> content .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> information that many of these <unk> images .
As you &apos;re doing a research of images on the web , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the web page , it &apos;s a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture <unk> all your pictures ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> <unk> that &apos;s really huge . It &apos;s a <unk> effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it &apos;s really incredible . <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> you very much .
One of the major <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is the to live between who has no <unk> <unk> <unk> , between the wind <unk> in the <unk> , the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of plants .
<unk> to think that <unk> will be <unk> <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> , <unk> still <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , and that the world in which we live in there is just a <unk> reality , but it &apos;s just a model of reality ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that our <unk> has done , good or evil , a lot of <unk> .
And of course , everybody <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . Everybody <unk> . Everybody <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We have to <unk> the <unk> of death , so we don &apos;t expect if we &apos;re <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art .
What <unk> is the <unk> of the song , the <unk> of the song of the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that it &apos;s <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> .
He was my <unk> of <unk> in <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> of <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> , the mother of the world .
All of these <unk> are <unk> that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you look at a moment , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of the world as a <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet , and it &apos;s important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , ideas , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being of the human imagination .
<unk> is the <unk> <unk> of humanity .
It &apos;s the <unk> of what we can be and as a <unk> species .
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> -- because it &apos;s <unk> , or -- in the <unk> <unk> -- in the <unk> of the <unk> diversity -- and they don &apos;t even have to <unk> <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> diversity .
The <unk> of this is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just a language <unk> by a <unk> or a series of <unk> rules .
One language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle with the <unk> of every culture comes in the material world .
Each language is a forest of mind , a <unk> , a thought , a <unk> of <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we &apos;re sitting here at <unk> , at least half not <unk> in the <unk> of children .
They &apos;re not <unk> to children , which means , unless you do something , which is not <unk> something , they &apos;re already .
What &apos;s more <unk> of being <unk> by <unk> , of being <unk> by <unk> , of the last being <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or to <unk> the <unk> of children ?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of someone in a few weeks , every two weeks of the world , every two weeks . <unk> a <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> with <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> language .
And I know that anybody &apos;s <unk> . &quot; <unk> &apos;t it better ?
The world would not be a better place if we all the same language ? &quot; <unk> , then we &apos;re all <unk> . <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> of a <unk> thing that means that we can talk about their language .
I &apos;d like to give you a journey to <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we &apos;re <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say &quot; different ways of <unk> <unk> , &quot; I mean , &quot; I mean different ways of <unk> .
<unk> for example , this <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , which <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s not able to <unk> the blue color because the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; : you have to <unk> a person talking about a language .
And all of this has been <unk> in the past <unk> , though the <unk> is that in these <unk> <unk> where you are or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> nobody <unk> .
It <unk> to hear and then he started talking .
I <unk> one of the most interesting <unk> with which I lived , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> contact with a <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;ve been <unk> from the top photographs that <unk> them in <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> forest <unk> had never seen anything .
They &apos;ve <unk> the <unk> pictures from the ground , they <unk> to <unk> a form or a <unk> , they don &apos;t know anything , they <unk> that they <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with the <unk> .
But <unk> not only <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> between them .
<unk> percent of <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We went to eight <unk> and we found two <unk> <unk> <unk> . And we found two <unk> to be <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was so <unk> that he died , and then they <unk> it .
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and to <unk> the species .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> a really interesting task when my <unk> <unk> <unk> , if I wanted to go to <unk> to <unk> between society <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to make the <unk> .
To make sense of <unk> , I should have to understand the <unk> culture , and that <unk> isn &apos;t <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s pretty <unk> of a <unk> view of the world .
Very interesting .
If you &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> of the world , what do you think ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
A continent &apos;s always left out , thinking that Africa <unk> is <unk> <unk> . And instead of yes , and the <unk> is nothing else to these <unk> <unk> very <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes interesting is the <unk> is the <unk> of <unk> of life and death .
So the <unk> do <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of alive so that for a short moment becomes the <unk> .
For this <unk> <unk> to say , &quot; <unk> go to <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re <unk> , is the spirit that you &apos;re <unk> , how do you get <unk> ?
So , you know , these incredible events : <unk> <unk> in the state of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather strong power of power of mind &apos;s mind when it &apos;s <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> that I &apos;ve lived with the most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> <unk> that once you <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> never <unk> from <unk> .
In <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> today , but their education is extraordinary <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> by <unk> <unk> for 18 or four years , and live in a world that &apos;s <unk> and <unk> in a world that &apos;s <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
For this time , they &apos;re <unk> to values about their society , values that <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or just to <unk> the <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> .
In the <unk> of this incredible <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> out and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 , see a <unk> . And in that moment of <unk> <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , everything they &apos;ve learned in the theory of <unk> <unk> , everything they &apos;ve learned in his <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and says :
&quot; <unk> ? <unk> how I said .
It &apos;s <unk> . Now it &apos;s you &apos;re going to <unk> . &quot;
They call more <unk> <unk> and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think about the <unk> and the <unk> environment , and the old <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> in his <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are more <unk> to the Earth than we .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by <unk> .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , but because of time and <unk> , have created a <unk> of the Earth is not about <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> , the idea that the Earth can only to live because it &apos;s <unk> human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
<unk> to say that a <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> spirit that <unk> its <unk> is going to be a <unk> different <unk> and will have a relationship different relationship with the mountain or that place to a <unk> of <unk> <unk> that <unk> a mountain is to be <unk> .
That &apos;s a <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is is that the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> and the natural world .
I grew in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> to be <unk> .
That made me a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> .
If we started <unk> that these <unk> can create different <unk> , we could actually create some <unk> of these <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ve <unk> this picture by <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What makes fascinating is not the <unk> potential of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
On the one hand , this <unk> <unk> that <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> you have a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit of the <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> with a <unk> of a <unk> of the family <unk> said <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> .
If you &apos;re going to see the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> that they do from a different species , <unk> it <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on for the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . <unk> &apos;t creates a <unk> of electricity . It creates a <unk> of reality .
<unk> often with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> my <unk> , you can &apos;t <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you &apos;re done not <unk> because if you &apos;re done not <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> , but they can &apos;t be <unk> <unk> because they &apos;re <unk> by a <unk> that &apos;s <unk> , of course , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s possible to <unk> <unk> if we &apos;re only <unk> with other <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Now it &apos;s the <unk> : the <unk> that are <unk> in this <unk> are <unk> of the <unk> , the same kind of <unk> to <unk> the <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of plants , how do these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , they make two <unk> don &apos;t like that , but if they do that , create a <unk> that &apos;s <unk> to the <unk> of the parts ?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you go to the <unk> , we &apos;ll be , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
What does it mean ?
This <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , who <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that our eyes are <unk> in the forest , and our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If you <unk> how to <unk> their <unk> will be <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> of plants , the rest ? &quot; I said , &quot; No .
The solution is : you take the <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t <unk> you to <unk> , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , &#91; the problem &#93; is that even those of us who are <unk> <unk> , but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of history of the <unk> of our real world , and it <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk> , but rather like the <unk> in which we <unk> and we have <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of mass <unk> of <unk> diversity and <unk> <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of mass <unk> diversity and <unk> of the planet is <unk> .
All the <unk> <unk> have been <unk> in a new <unk> for life .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> don &apos;t have <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> <unk> and <unk> like <unk> don &apos;t have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s not the change or the technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It &apos;s power .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you look at the world , <unk> that these are not <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that go beyond their <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that &apos;s <unk> <unk> in the <unk> to a generation ago , and now you &apos;re <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or in the case of <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> .
If we go to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the <unk> of the political <unk> .
As a <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of a <unk> , is <unk> to <unk> level , but the <unk> of the <unk> of a <unk> of a <unk> , not only is <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it &apos;s part of <unk> development .
And you can &apos;t understand the <unk> of the <unk> until it comes from the beginning .
I &apos;ve got the <unk> miles from <unk> in China through the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only get there to <unk> <unk> I realized what &apos;s behind the <unk> that we &apos;re talking about .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> at the <unk> <unk> .
That means that it &apos;s been <unk> to the <unk> of Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk> .
It was taken of <unk> in <unk> at the age of two <unk> under his <unk> because he wouldn &apos;t have to live without a living .
The <unk> , which he did the same , was <unk> in <unk> .
One day he <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to work for seven years .
The pain of the <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> of <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> , all of that , all <unk> to a choice .
How do we want to live in the <unk> world or we want to <unk> the world <unk> of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before they die said that his greatest fear was <unk> , in our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it &apos;s <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , which has given us <unk> to us to the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , by creating the <unk> of the <unk> , by creating the <unk> of <unk> , and we &apos;re talking about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has to <unk> 300 years .
That <unk> history doesn &apos;t really expect to me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we could <unk> in the <unk> to come .
When to these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of being what we are : a <unk> species , which has to be <unk> . And there are great moments of <unk> . And there are great moments of <unk> .
I &apos;ve <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> island , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> , he <unk> me , he <unk> the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The <unk> government has not been <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> for <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
The family , <unk> for his life , <unk> <unk> away all of the <unk> , and all of his <unk> .
We want to know that <unk> don &apos;t <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> were made of fish <unk> fish .
The <unk> of this man didn &apos;t <unk> at night or at the <unk> that <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> away , it &apos;s <unk> the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did I <unk> it , he <unk> it by it by it <unk> , he <unk> by it <unk> , he <unk> by <unk> .
He &apos;s <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when he <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , he <unk> another dog and he &apos;s <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> of <unk> in <unk> .
Do you want to talk about <unk> ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> the government <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> of an area of <unk> larger California and <unk> <unk> together .
It &apos;s their new <unk> . It &apos;s called <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s all the <unk> resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , to end , I think , is quite <unk> to people who are in these <unk> <unk> of the planet , <unk> that &apos;s not at all <unk> .
For somebody &apos;s house .
<unk> <unk> of human imagination that <unk> at the time . And for all of these children , like dreams , are part of our children , are <unk> part of the hope of the <unk> of hope .
<unk> , we &apos;re <unk> <unk> we &apos;re <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> to nothing .
<unk> that the <unk> --
&#91; <unk> &#93; aren &apos;t <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and perhaps we &apos;re the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our site <unk> <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public places to <unk> <unk> from which <unk> to <unk> from how they &apos;ve seen and , they <unk> , <unk> , once the central <unk> for <unk> , the world of <unk> in <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , the world of <unk> diversity in a <unk> world , and we have to find a <unk> world in a <unk> world . And we have to <unk> a <unk> world
where the <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope <unk> other than you &apos;ve heard and <unk> some <unk> <unk> , in case they don &apos;t .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> of all the <unk> of all of society <unk> . <unk> <unk> : &quot; If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens . &quot; The way to do it is to <unk> freedom to <unk> . &quot;
The reason is , on one side , in fact that freedom is <unk> itself , <unk> for humans .
<unk> else is that if we &apos;re <unk> , we &apos;re all <unk> , we can act to do this for all of us to <unk> , without nobody that to <unk> in our <unk> .
The way to <unk> the freedom is <unk> .
The more choices are <unk> , and more <unk> is their <unk> .
This , <unk> , it &apos;s so <unk> <unk> in society that nobody would <unk> to <unk> in <unk> .
And it &apos;s also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I &apos;ll show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to give me a simple note on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and 12 <unk> <unk> you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that nobody has already <unk> in your <unk> .
That &apos;s how <unk> is .
Then you go to the <unk> store , to buy a <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> <unk> .
We can do six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are only one store .
<unk> <unk> there is choice .
<unk> fields : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a kid , you could get all the <unk> <unk> <unk> , to <unk> that they were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
It <unk> the phone , you don &apos;t <unk> it .
A <unk> of that , by the way , was that the phone never <unk> .
These days they went .
We have a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , especially <unk> <unk> .
That &apos;s cell phones in the future .
My <unk> is the one in the middle , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
If you don &apos;t have seen it in the store , you &apos;re very much <unk> that soon .
And what happens to the end is that people get into the <unk> and they do this question . And you know , what &apos;s the answer is ? The answer is &quot; No .
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do anything .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , they <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : It &apos;s no longer going on in the United States you &apos;re <unk> and the <unk> you &apos;re going to be what you have to do .
Instead , <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> says , &quot; OK , we could do it , or <unk> , &quot; A <unk> , &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> <unk> . What do you do you want to do ? &quot;
You were <unk> , &quot; <unk> , what would you do ? &quot;
And the <unk> says , &quot; He has these <unk> and these <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> <unk> and these <unk> . &quot;
&quot; What do you do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; <unk> if she was me , what would you say ? &quot;
And the <unk> , &quot; I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; , &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; , &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot;
But in fact , it &apos;s not that a <unk> the weight and the responsibility for making decisions of a <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> , <unk> , and of course , is <unk> -- and we don &apos;t know , in the <unk> <unk> to make decisions , the patient .
There &apos;s a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me and you , if you think it doesn &apos;t make sense , because we can &apos;t think that .
But if we can &apos;t <unk> , why do we <unk> them ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> of so <unk> as it is our <unk> <unk> is a matter of choice , as you see in this <unk> . &quot; We don &apos;t want to <unk> kids . We want to <unk> their sex . &quot; We don &apos;t want to <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
That means that every <unk> , <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
<unk> to family and <unk> , a time the common perspective , <unk> to anybody , was that you had to <unk> the <unk> soon , and they were <unk> to children as soon as possible .
The only real <unk> was to the people who , not when , and they didn &apos;t even want to do .
<unk> , it &apos;s really about to play .
We &apos;re going to be very smart students , and they &apos;re going to be 20 percent in time .
And they &apos;re not because they &apos;re less <unk> , not because they &apos;re <unk> .
But why they &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> to <unk> , &quot; <unk> or not ? <unk> , do it now ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> later ? I have to think before kids or <unk> ? &quot;
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this <unk> doesn &apos;t <unk> the <unk> that we &apos;re going to be <unk> to my <unk> .
And they really need to do that . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the work : we &apos;re <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> , because the technology allows us to work every minute , from every corner of the planet , <unk> that from the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> , and I don &apos;t tell anybody what the <unk> works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What does it mean , this incredible <unk> of choice that we have to do it ? It &apos;s that we have to make them <unk> , if we need to work or not .
We can go to see our son to play <unk> , with the <unk> in a <unk> , the other , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> on the <unk> .
And even if they &apos;re all <unk> , every minute we see our son <unk> the <unk> , we &apos;re also <unk> , &quot; I have to answer this ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this <unk> ? I have to <unk> this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , it &apos;s all about the <unk> of your son very different than that it would be in other conditions .
So , from any <unk> , small things , small and big , objects and big , <unk> objects , life is a matter of choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibility , but it wasn &apos;t all of choice .
The world &apos;s world today &apos;s <unk> to this : <unk> is , &quot; Is it a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? &quot;
The answer is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> we all know , so I &apos;ll tell you about the <unk> .
We &apos;re going to be this <unk> two effects of people .
The first one , <unk> , is that it <unk> instead of <unk> .
With a lot of <unk> between , it becomes very difficult .
I &apos;ll give you an example of <unk> : a study <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of my <unk> <unk> data , the <unk> <unk> society , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , with about a million <unk> <unk> in different <unk> <unk> .
What she found her , is that for the 10 <unk> that are <unk> more , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> of two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s 10 percent less than when they &apos;re available , they &apos;re only <unk> . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> between them , is it &apos;s <unk> difficult to decide , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And in <unk> , and still <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course <unk> <unk> never comes from .
<unk> that doesn &apos;t just mean only that these <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they will not have enough money , they want to say that the decision is so <unk> that they &apos;re also <unk> the <unk> of work .
They &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> until about five <unk> <unk> per year from work , which would be well to <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices .
And I think that &apos;s the world like that .
&quot; And to end , to end up the <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
You can just make the right decision , if it &apos;s for the <unk> , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong <unk> , and you &apos;re going to be wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can <unk> the <unk> and make a choice , at the end of how we <unk> to <unk> <unk> with less <unk> than we had to choose .
And that for different reasons .
One of these is that with so many <unk> between you , if you &apos;re going to <unk> one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine you could have a different choice than it would be better . And what happens is that <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> the decision , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the decision <unk> ,
even when it was a <unk> decision .
The more choices there are , the easier to <unk> any <unk> that &apos;s <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> , there &apos;s what <unk> call .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well known as the value we give things to things <unk> from what we <unk> .
<unk> , when there are many <unk> possible , it &apos;s easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and be less <unk> than the <unk> that &apos;s <unk> .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m <unk> with everybody who &apos;s not New York .
But that &apos;s what we &apos;re probably going to happen .
There &apos;s this <unk> to the <unk> .
A <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It &apos;s all for them .
It doesn &apos;t happen . But what he thinks about is , &quot; Well , <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; All my <unk> <unk> are away . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> right in front of the house . &quot;
And it <unk> two weeks <unk> from the idea that &apos;s <unk> -- every day , the possibility of <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the more they are the <unk> that we have <unk> , the more the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
We live the moment of living the moment , and perhaps in the <unk> of the <unk> .
But the most important point is that anything you <unk> , you will <unk> not do other .
The things that don &apos;t <unk> have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> point : <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk> .
It &apos;s almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were just one kind of , and they were <unk> and <unk> by <unk> , they were <unk> , only after they had a <unk> and <unk> a lot of times , <unk> to go well .
So , I started <unk> a couple of new when the <unk> were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> said , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
Do you want them with <unk> or with <unk> ? &quot; <unk> &quot; or &quot; <unk> &quot; ?
&quot; <unk> wants to <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- &quot; <unk> to <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a while I was able to say , &quot; I want the kind of <unk> . &quot; It had no idea what it was , so for a <unk> . I would all be <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , and then <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , and then <unk> , with the best couple of <unk> that I had .
It was <unk> . With that choice I had <unk> the best .
But I &apos;ll be worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to <unk> .
The reason I was that I was worse is that with all of the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
And I had <unk> <unk> . I didn &apos;t know anything about it when I just had a guy , but when I just <unk> 100 different , <unk> , at least a <unk> to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After I <unk> that I was <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in life of people don &apos;t do that <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
And that &apos;s less <unk> , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of <unk> if it <unk> .
Because if I <unk> , I don &apos;t understand what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth will be more to that .
&quot; He was better when he was worse was <unk> , &quot; The reason he was better . &quot; The reason he was even worse than <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world we live in -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> we can <unk> is that things to the <unk> of <unk> .
You &apos;ve never <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you &apos;re here is , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; Yes , you want it . &quot;
I mean -- little <unk> moment -- that I &apos;m really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn &apos;t have to do it better , I don &apos;t have <unk> .
But <unk> is not always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> of a couple of <unk> <unk> when there &apos;s only that kind of <unk> is that when you &apos;re <unk> , and you will tell you , &quot; Why ? &quot;
Who is <unk> ? &quot; <unk> , the answer is <unk> .
The world is <unk> . What can I do with it ?
When there are hundreds of <unk> , and you get a <unk> , and you &apos;ll notice who &apos;s the <unk> , is clear to the <unk> , is clear clear that the <unk> you are .
We could have better .
With hundreds of <unk> <unk> , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even if the <unk> is <unk> , they get <unk> and they give them their own .
In the last few years , the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only one , but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is just that people have <unk> experiences because the standard are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this , they think that <unk> is their .
So the final result is that in general we &apos;re better , but we &apos;re going to be worse .
Let me tell you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and is completely <unk> . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than a bit of choice at all , but this doesn &apos;t <unk> that much better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a <unk> value , <unk> . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve <unk> from a piece of piece of music that we &apos;ve <unk> our <unk> .
Now , from the <unk> <unk> -- I almost finished -- from the <unk> <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
What allows all of this choice in <unk> society is the <unk> <unk> .
There are many places in the world , and you &apos;re <unk> <unk> , where the problem is that they have <unk> .
The problem is that they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I &apos;m talking about is a <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> has talked about yesterday about how <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> of money .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , not is that they &apos;re just <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
They do have worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows us to <unk> to be <unk> in those where people have too few possibilities , it &apos;s not only about their lives to <unk> , but also our own .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income is good at all -- not only to the poor people -- not only because of this choice in <unk> that we &apos;re going to be <unk> .
So to <unk> , &quot; <unk> , you can become what you want . &quot;
<unk> , people of culture , <unk> , &quot; What are the fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s <unk> that you can &apos;t do anything in a glass <unk> . &quot;
&quot; A <unk> imagination , a <unk> <unk> of the world --
and I <unk> it like that , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I realized that fish knows that fish knows the fish knows long .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you &apos;re <unk> the <unk> , so that &quot; everything is possible . &quot; You can &apos;t <unk> the freedom .
If you <unk> the <unk> so that you can <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
Everybody needs a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , perhaps even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
