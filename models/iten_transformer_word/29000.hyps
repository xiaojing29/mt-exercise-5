<unk> year I showed this <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years has been the size of the United States , <unk> <unk> , has <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m going to <unk> this <unk> of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a sense , the heart of the global climate system .
It <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> for the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You see , you know , it &apos;s going to be <unk> until the blue <unk> .
That &apos;s the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> in summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , of five years or more , it &apos;s like the blood <unk> that you &apos;re in here from the body .
In 25 years it was going to be like this .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> is <unk> around the ocean <unk> , where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> , are <unk> in <unk> by the <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , the amount of <unk> <unk> , that amount could <unk> , <unk> this point not <unk> .
In some of the <unk> <unk> in <unk> the <unk> is already <unk> by water .
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> was <unk> with a <unk> team at the bottom <unk> last <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! Al <unk> : She &apos;s fine . The question is , if we <unk> it .
One is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the north .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> never <unk> like that .
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you want to know how to <unk> the sea level to <unk> on <unk> , here is where the sea <unk> .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
On the other hand on the planet : <unk> , the largest ice <unk> of the planet .
<unk> month scientists have <unk> that the ice <unk> is in <unk> , and that the Western <unk> , which <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> at six feet of <unk> , like <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the largest <unk> of ice , you see ice <unk> , which few years ago , and in <unk> .
<unk> percent of the world &apos;s population <unk> half of <unk> water from that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : this <unk> is the source of <unk> <unk> this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same thing happens to <unk> water .
In California , <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> of 40 percent .
<unk> <unk> are in crisis .
<unk> , as you read , as you read , they &apos;re <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the world takes to a <unk> increase in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and without <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years than the <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the whole <unk> .
If you look at it in the <unk> context , you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we &apos;ve <unk> million CO2 <unk> every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the ocean every day .
Look at <unk> , the area of the <unk> <unk> , to <unk> , and on both the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , where there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> oxygen in the ocean .
The greater cause of the global warming , together to the <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of two countries with more emissions with China .
And you &apos;re going to build a lot of other <unk> .
But we &apos;re <unk> to a <unk> of direction .
These are the projects that over the last years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
Every way , there &apos;s a political <unk> in our country .
<unk> of <unk> and <unk> oil have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I <unk> to <unk> something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You may have seen it on the <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> of <unk> in America .
It happened around <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> the <unk> is a <unk> and happy .
It &apos;s <unk> here in America , and <unk> our economy .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Al <unk> : <unk> here is a large <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
The greatest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al <unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , a part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> , we see the <unk> change as a <unk> <unk> to our business .
So , we have a lot of money in a <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> the truth .
Actually , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it &apos;s <unk> -- it &apos;s got a good <unk> .
So we don &apos;t have to <unk> in climate change .
We want to do that .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you &apos;ve heard that much .
So , we &apos;re going to take a <unk> structure for the <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> are a little <unk> , but this is the sound of <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> is between the main <unk> of global warming , but the <unk> technology of <unk> that you see change everything .
Let &apos;s look at this : this is the <unk> technology of <unk> .
Al <unk> : <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security .
<unk> : <unk> : America is in the crisis , national security , the <unk> crisis .
The <unk> that all the <unk> that all of us from the <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and <unk> .
Now , there &apos;s a new solution for <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan to <unk> America to work , <unk> more <unk> , and help <unk> the global <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we &apos;re going to solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
Al <unk> : This is the last .
<unk> : <unk> : It &apos;s about <unk> energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , sun , <unk> , a new <unk> network .
<unk> 2 : <unk> <unk> <unk> for jobs <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> America . It &apos;s time to be <unk> .
Al <unk> : A <unk> <unk> <unk> says , &quot; If you want to go alone , go alone .
If you want to go far , go . &quot;
We have to go far away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED I made a <unk> on <unk> .
And I &apos;m trying to <unk> to <unk> how the machine works .
So here we go . And for the ones that the other time didn &apos;t have , the <unk> is the largest experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles .
<unk> is to <unk> the conditions that were present less than a <unk> of the second <unk> from the universe -- until <unk> million times a second .
All of this is simply <unk> .
This is the <unk> machine .
They <unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk> .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> feet and it &apos;s a <unk> feet .
This is a <unk> image of <unk> in construction . And so you can see the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of the last year we <unk> the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in control in the <unk> .
It &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> of particles that he had done all the <unk> , <unk> in <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles inside the <unk> .
In other words , when you <unk> that image , the 10 <unk> , you know that the machine <unk> , which is a big <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if that was that to make us <unk> , or this , when someone <unk> on Google and they would <unk> that the <unk> page was this .
That means we have a <unk> impact on the scientific .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to do this <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine works at the <unk> of the <unk> .
Now , the <unk> of you <unk> and <unk> , &quot; It &apos;s not true . I &apos;m too <unk> . I &apos;m too <unk> . &quot;
And instead they can do it because when they &apos;re very <unk> to become the <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees , to a temperature <unk> to that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a electric <unk> .
That was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> will be more than 20 <unk> , and that &apos;s <unk> about 30 <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , which we did .
We have <unk> and <unk> .
They &apos;re now <unk> everybody in their <unk> .
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> is going to be new <unk> .
We <unk> it , and we &apos;ll try to get <unk> data or <unk> , and continue that way our <unk> to find out what the <unk> are going to find out what the universe is .
Now , of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> <unk> the value of science and engineering <unk> . It &apos;s easy to <unk> .
I think it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s value of things like <unk> .
I &apos;d like to end with a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> , in <unk> of <unk> experiments of his <unk> , his <unk> was Michael <unk> , said , &quot; No is that there &apos;s no <unk> <unk> in the human mind as the science of the human mind as the science of the human mind , that our <unk> are <unk> , and that we don &apos;t have <unk> in nature , which our <unk> are <unk> <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to <unk> when , as a children , <unk> with <unk> .
<unk> <unk> as we <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , in fact , to think and <unk> , <unk> relationships .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way most of the world around us .
So , as a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects , with my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started to say , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having the only <unk> <unk> of the digital <unk> that <unk> on a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> a <unk> information with both with both hands ,
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
So , the question was so interesting that I was going to go into the answer , and we build the <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as big as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as big as a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , they can feel their movement and feel their movement and they have a screen and they have a screen .
But <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> them .
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> the digital information .
And as it <unk> as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement , and others . And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement , and others , how we can explore them , to explore new <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
I &apos;ll start with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you some video . If you put it in one direction , the <unk> video , so if we were on the other side , it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> .
If you <unk> them , they &apos;re <unk> to what it &apos;s going around .
If they &apos;re <unk> , they <unk> and they can <unk> it a little bit .
If they &apos;re <unk> , they <unk> and they can <unk> it a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We then realized that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> <unk> was the <unk> that you could use common on data , for example , as if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> of <unk> and I can <unk> it to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , where they <unk> .
and I can <unk> it to <unk> the <unk> color in that central .
If you get too much , we can <unk> it a little bit .
There are also <unk> possibilities to <unk> , like <unk> , <unk> and <unk> games where people can try things quickly , and they can try things quickly .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a <unk> sequence I &apos;m doing with a <unk> program .
Here we have a game of words that is in half between <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> , a letter to <unk> , on every <unk> , <unk> , at every <unk> , a letter <unk> , and <unk> <unk> of <unk> words on every <unk> , and while <unk> of <unk> him up a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you get , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
There are some kids who are <unk> in <unk> <unk> , I did that <unk> them and I <unk> them a video .
They &apos;re very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things like this is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just say , &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; I &apos;m going to just say , &quot; I &apos;m <unk> . &quot; And they know exactly what to do .
There &apos;s other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , and on the right .
Actually , he wanted to just <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> you build a tool for <unk> <unk> . He &apos;s <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So , he &apos;s making the sun out .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now he brought a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> work ! Yeah !
So , you get the <unk> and <unk> can make the characters .
<unk> : <unk> !
-- <unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with open <unk> , and it can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with open <unk> , and it can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time to show you is a tool that &apos;s made of a recent <unk> to <unk> and <unk> music .
It &apos;s a tool , which is just made of music , to <unk> and music .
<unk> here <unk> as <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of these has four different <unk> , and you can choose which to use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence from <unk> to your <unk> .
And we just <unk> a <unk> sound and a sequence .
These are effects that you can control live , like <unk> and <unk> .
They &apos;re going to <unk> a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then you have the <unk> effects as time and <unk> , which is <unk> to the whole sequence .
<unk> how it works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> one <unk> <unk> , <unk> a <unk> <unk> , <unk> them in a series , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Now , we &apos;re going to take a <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : Now we &apos;re going to <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : And I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> , so I can control the effect of alive .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the whole sequence of time from one side or another .
<unk> : <unk> : And now we get the <unk> <unk> down to give more <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the sequence of <unk> .
So I don &apos;t have to tell you that , but I can get it out , it &apos;s a long or more <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the whole sequence on the left the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> and more <unk> to how we work our brain and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this path , and some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to <unk> is that it &apos;s going to <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> with media <unk> , which <unk> information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I can &apos;t see the time I &apos;m going to talk to you .
I &apos;m a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the <unk> of my life .
And I don &apos;t look what it might change .
But , by the way , something particular happened in my life and in my life , which led me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I &apos;ve written about this book , this <unk> called &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which , <unk> from my <unk> books , for some <unk> reason in the world and <unk> a big , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere I would say , I &apos;m <unk> to <unk> as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I &apos;m going to go to me and say , &quot; Don &apos;t you <unk> to be able to do better ?
You don &apos;t fear of <unk> to write for the whole life that you could <unk> to create a book that can help someone do a book that can help you do a book that would help you get to write about it for someone ? &quot;
that he can help someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> , you know .
But it could be worse , except I remember that over 20 years ago , when I was thinking about people -- I was a <unk> -- that I wanted to be a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to take a <unk> <unk> .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you know that you couldn &apos;t <unk> ?
<unk> &apos;t you that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> you ?
You don &apos;t really fear of doing this <unk> all of life without anything that ever comes out and die on a <unk> of <unk> dreams with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
So , you know .
The short answer to all these questions is , is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yeah , I &apos;m afraid all of all of that .
I &apos;ve always been afraid .
And I also fear of a lot of other things that people can &apos;t <unk> .
Like <unk> and other things that are <unk> .
But I &apos;m going to write it about and writing me , it &apos;s <unk> me , because ?
Is it <unk> ?
It &apos;s <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel to do .
But what is so particular about the <unk> <unk> that we have <unk> in <unk> <unk> that other <unk> do not do ?
How do my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> , and I don &apos;t remember one time in his <unk> <unk> , where he was asked if he was <unk> <unk> ?
There was never -- that <unk> of the <unk> John , how did it ?
Don &apos;t you like that , <unk> ?
<unk> , the engineers <unk> as a group of not have certainly , in <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> .
We have enough , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> but <unk> like that , we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk> .
And so , nothing else that look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that only in the <unk> century , young and often as they .
And the ones that don &apos;t seem to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before he died , in the last <unk> said , &quot; Every my book <unk> me a little bit more , &quot; <unk> <unk> about the work of their life .
But we don &apos;t know <unk> when we say it because we &apos;ve heard these things so long that we have <unk> <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and creativity <unk> in some way <unk> and <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
And the question I want to ask you to everybody here today is : You agree with this idea ?
You &apos;re fine with this thing -- because it &apos;s also <unk> from a <unk> distance to me not .
I think it &apos;s <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s also <unk> and I don &apos;t want to <unk> you in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better <unk> our big <unk> to live .
And certainly , I know that , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start to the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> that I &apos;m in my career .
<unk> -- look , I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;m like , I &apos;m like 40 years old .
I still have about four <unk> of work in me .
And it &apos;s very <unk> that whatever you &apos;re going to do in the world , as a job <unk> that <unk> after the <unk> <unk> of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we &apos;re all about friends here -- it &apos;s <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , what thought !
You know , the kind of thought that leads a person to start <unk> <unk> at nine <unk> in the morning , and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so , it seems to me , after many <unk> , that the way to work to keep writing is that you can do that in order to do a <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to think a way of <unk> a distance between me , which I &apos;m <unk> , and my natural <unk> that <unk> that <unk> that <unk> that <unk> that <unk> <unk> that last year would be looking through the <unk> , trying to find other societies , and to see if you have better ideas and more <unk> than it .
how to help people <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research led me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re going to be because they &apos;re going to go back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don &apos;t believe that creativity <unk> by men , OK ?
It turns out that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> from a <unk> to <unk> and <unk> , for <unk> and <unk> , for <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity <unk> of creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from far away .
The <unk> were the same idea , but it <unk> the kind of spirit without a <unk> .
which is <unk> , because the <unk> don &apos;t really understand that a <unk> was particularly smart .
I thought a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> literally <unk> in the <unk> of the study , a little artist like <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> out to <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the result of that .
<unk> <unk> , that &apos;s the distance I &apos;m talking about -- that <unk> <unk> you &apos;re going to <unk> you from your <unk> .
And everybody <unk> that was so that we were <unk> , right ?
So the <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like too <unk> , you know , you know , too <unk> ?
If your work was <unk> you don &apos;t have to <unk> all the <unk> , you all know that you have been <unk> from this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , you know , it wasn &apos;t all your <unk> , right ?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
And then the <unk> <unk> and everything , and we <unk> this great idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe on top and without to leave space on the <unk> .
This was the <unk> principle and people started to think that creativity was going to completely <unk> by the <unk> .
And for the first time in history , you start <unk> with this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> , rather than a <unk> with a person with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think that was a big <unk> .
I think that &apos;s going to be somebody , a simple person to believe that they &apos;re like a <unk> , like the source , and the <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> is a responsibility to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s like to someone to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> the <unk> and creates all of these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think that &apos;s been <unk> to have <unk> artists in the 500 years .
And , if that &apos;s true , and I think it &apos;s really , the question becomes , and now
Can we do it ?
I want to go back to a <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t do 500 years of thinking <unk> in a <unk> talk .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of , <unk> , you do that people are <unk> to <unk> to their projects .
You probably don &apos;t want to <unk> you all this .
But the question I &apos;d like to ask you is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t we do this way ?
Because more sense of everything I &apos;ve ever heard about to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process .
A process that , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so basically , everybody here -- knows , you don &apos;t know <unk> .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seem completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> to <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , who has now 90 years , but has been a <unk> for the whole life and said that in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the field , <unk> out in the field , and <unk> it , in the field , and I <unk> it , in the <unk> <unk> .
He said that he was like a <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> <unk> towards her <unk> .
He <unk> him to get , because he <unk> the earth under his feet .
I decided to have one thing to do to do that point and was of , words , &quot; <unk> as a <unk> . &quot;
And so he went back home and he came from this <unk> , and he wouldn &apos;t have anything but he should have a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> on the page .
Sometimes I didn &apos;t want to be fast enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> them to get to the house and she would <unk> them up through the <unk> , looking for it , and she would <unk> her , looking at the <unk> , looking at it , and she would <unk> it to <unk> , and she would <unk> them in and <unk> it to <unk> through the
And then there were those times -- this piece of the time , it never -- there were times when the <unk> was almost <unk> , OK ?
So , he was coming back home and he was looking for the <unk> and the <unk> through , and he <unk> a <unk> just in the while he was <unk> , and then he said , that he was like to <unk> with the other hand and the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> and the <unk> in his body and <unk> it into his body and <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk> , but <unk> , from the last word to first .
So when I <unk> <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not all my <unk> process -- I &apos;m not a <unk> .
I &apos;m a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; I &apos;m <unk> at the same <unk> every day and <unk> and work and <unk> on top of the <unk> .
But even I , in my <unk> , I &apos;ve <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I &apos;m <unk> that a lot of you have to do it .
You know , even if I do it and ideas I would <unk> them from a certain source , I can &apos;t <unk> it .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> to it in it so we don &apos;t get your head , but rather , that &apos;s <unk> <unk> us ?
As far as I think , the best example , which I &apos;ve <unk> is the <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;ve <unk> several years ago for a <unk> .
I &apos;m talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the artist <unk> <unk> <unk> , trying to control , <unk> these species of <unk> totally <unk> .
But then <unk> , he <unk> , and one day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , <unk> it all for him .
<unk> on the <unk> and everything about a <unk> of this little <unk> of <unk> , and it comes in his head like <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and <unk> , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the <unk> , but you don &apos;t know how to <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
So he starts to hear this kind of old <unk> <unk> in him like , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to <unk> <unk> from this <unk> song .
I &apos;m not <unk> enough and I can &apos;t <unk> . &quot;
And instead of going to the <unk> , they <unk> .
<unk> the whole process and made something completely new .
He just just <unk> the sky and said , &quot; <unk> , you don &apos;t see that I &apos;m <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Do it seem to write a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you get a more <unk> when I can take care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> more .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And his process <unk> <unk> after that .
Not the work , it was still <unk> as always as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> had been <unk> when he was <unk> the <unk> , he <unk> that out of him <unk> , and he <unk> it back where he was , he was , he was , he was , he was that he had to be <unk> and <unk> .
but I saw this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> <unk> and this thing <unk> , and it was not <unk> .
So , how much that story I <unk> to change a little bit , even the way I &apos;m going to <unk> and I &apos;ve already <unk> .
This idea , I &apos;m going to talk , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; and <unk> , &quot; and <unk> in one of those <unk> <unk> in which we &apos;re all working on something and we &apos;re not going to think it will be a <unk> , which will be the book .
Not just <unk> , really the book <unk> .
And we started thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I &apos;m going to <unk> that I would <unk> up to the air and <unk> .
So I <unk> my face up on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> corner of the room .
And I said , &quot; <unk> , what , we both know that if this book is not going to be <unk> , I &apos;m not going to be <unk> <unk> , my ?
Because you see , I &apos;m <unk> all I have , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , I don &apos;t do anything .
I &apos;m going to write the same because it &apos;s my job .
And I &apos;d like to please , that I &apos;m <unk> today to do my part . &quot; Because at the end is like , &quot; Because , OK , so , so you know , OK , it &apos;s going to do it in the <unk> of Africa , you get <unk> to the moon , and they were <unk> for hours to <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every once in a while , you know , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> .
And I know you know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you &apos;ve all seen , at some point , a <unk> like this .
It was like time to <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it was not doing anything different from the usually , like the <unk> <unk> before , but it was all <unk> .
And suddenly it doesn &apos;t <unk> as a human just .
But it <unk> up from the <unk> and <unk> in the fire of the <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , they <unk> him in his name .
<unk> hands and <unk> to <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , &quot; God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , they <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , they <unk> this <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , &quot; to &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which , you still can hear in the <unk> or in the <unk> .
In <unk> , when an artist did something impossible to <unk> and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it &apos;s <unk> because we need it .
But , the problem comes up the next day , for the <unk> itself , when you go and see that <unk> are 11 <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> . They don &apos;t have more .
It &apos;s just a <unk> with a big <unk> to the <unk> , and maybe not even more to <unk> the <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God as we go and what &apos;s them ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so <unk> if you can &apos;t believe , <unk> , that the most <unk> <unk> of your being are being being being <unk> by yourself .
But just , you know that you &apos;re data in <unk> from a <unk> of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to another one .
And , you know , if we think it in this way , it changes .
And so I started <unk> , and it &apos;s like I &apos;ve been <unk> for several months in the book that I was <unk> early on the book that I was <unk> early on .
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel <unk> on this is , I don &apos;t fear .
You don &apos;t get it . You just have your work .
You &apos;re going to be <unk> for your part , any of you can be .
If you &apos;re <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> .
If the <unk> , you &apos;re going to be <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for one moment through your <unk> , then &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
<unk> , you do the same <unk> .
And &quot; <unk> ! &quot; to you do that .
I think it &apos;s <unk> . I think it &apos;s <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; to you do that , even for <unk> love of human and <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know I &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects on the human genome on what <unk> and discovery of new genes are genes of genes .
We &apos;re <unk> a new path to <unk> biology and we &apos;ve started <unk> the biology and now starting from that digital code , we &apos;re <unk> in a new <unk> <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We &apos;ve always been trying to get big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that a lot of <unk> I think have <unk> that I think have <unk> different <unk> .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> for almost 20 years now .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> from the <unk> world to go from the <unk> world to the digital world of computer .
Now , is <unk> : Can we <unk> life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> a even smaller .
We can actually <unk> a <unk> of genes about 500 that are here .
But when we take a look at his <unk> map , it &apos;s <unk> simple than our own .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at a time , it &apos;s very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell .
So we thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> in a way to <unk> this <unk> , some of these <unk> questions .
And so we started the <unk> of &quot; Can we have a <unk> ? &quot;
Can the chemistry <unk> to produce these big molecules that we &apos;ve never done before ?
And in case , how can we make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> material that &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> .
The speed with which we can <unk> the life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the code , instead of <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> .
And our most <unk> results of <unk> that are <unk> .
We &apos;ve <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before experiments .
But we found that DNA <unk> is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of <unk> in the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA , of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> process : the more the long is , the more <unk> is there .
So we had to develop a new way to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , <unk> <unk> information from digital information digital <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a little virus that <unk> bacteria .
We designed <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of about <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> it in the bacteria , and they <unk> it in the bacteria , and they <unk> the <unk> particles .
<unk> particles have been there were <unk> by the cells , they <unk> back and <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ve talked about the <unk> industry that they &apos;ve talked about the <unk> industry that they &apos;ve certainly <unk> this model .
They &apos;ve <unk> more than you .
I think this is a situation where software really can build its software really can build its same <unk> in a <unk> system .
But you have to do the bigger things .
You had to build the entire <unk> of the <unk> .
They &apos;re more than <unk> <unk> <unk> of code .
So we thought we &apos;re in <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , so that we can change the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> information with <unk> information into a computer , these must be very <unk> .
When we did this genome for the first time in <unk> , the standard <unk> was of a <unk> <unk> for every 10 <unk> .
We found out , we had 30 <unk> . If we were to use that original sequence never could do it .
A process is to design <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build <unk> <unk> that they could build smaller <unk> that <unk> together .
<unk> elements here .
You probably have read that you &apos;ve seen from the <unk> .
So , we have a <unk> code that <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , and there &apos;s a <unk> order to <unk> it for every <unk> .
So we can use the <unk> code to write , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did was at the beginning was <unk> .
Some of them have been <unk> by the fact that it was not <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started <unk> with parts , we had <unk> <unk> from five to seven <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , we have these <unk> <unk> in the <unk> so that we &apos;re trying to create an extremely <unk> <unk> <unk> as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to <unk> the process .
So , this seems like a <unk> <unk> .
When you get these <unk> <unk> , more than 100 <unk> <unk> , you don &apos;t get <unk> directly into the <unk> <unk> .
It comes to the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> biology .
So we have to <unk> more .
<unk> another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> <unk> to <unk> DNA .
Here &apos;s an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , it can take three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> <unk> .
<unk> hours , it &apos;s been <unk> as it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that can do that .
These organisms can <unk> completely .
You have to live under <unk> .
They &apos;re absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and it <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
Actually , NASA , showed that this happens .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we &apos;ve built these <unk> , just using the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> design of <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s such a big <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that I &apos;m going to take a period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> that we &apos;ve done a little bit of time ago .
They &apos;re more than <unk> <unk> of code .
It &apos;s the greatest <unk> of a <unk> structure ever <unk> by man .
It has a <unk> weight <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a 10 <unk> without spaces , we just <unk> pages to <unk> this code .
Now , how do we make it work ? How can we <unk> it ?
Of course , there &apos;s a virus is a <unk> game .
It &apos;s a little bit more <unk> when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s easier even when it comes to <unk> cells like this : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the <unk> process .
In <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> in the cell , but we have <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re able to do a <unk> <unk> from one cell to another and of <unk> .
We have a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> species .
The two are different than men are <unk> .
We &apos;ve <unk> a few <unk> more <unk> to decide what you &apos;re going to choose what this <unk> .
He then <unk> it with the <unk> so that he <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the cell .
And we had <unk> that we didn &apos;t want to go beyond , but we tried to <unk> more .
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere , we <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So , those who think of evolution as a <unk> at a time that <unk> has not <unk> a lot of biology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell didn &apos;t <unk> one .
The <unk> <unk> that we <unk> it .
It <unk> , and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material , it <unk> , and we <unk> it , and we <unk> with only the cell and the <unk> .
has become blue because of the genes that we &apos;ve <unk> .
And in a short amount of time , all of the <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> of the whole <unk> , and it <unk> of all in a new species , <unk> on software that we &apos;ve <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code that will <unk> exactly what we &apos;ve <unk> .
Now , this might seem <unk> <unk> , but we can <unk> the software DNA <unk> , we can change things in a pretty <unk> way .
Now , I &apos;ve already <unk> that you &apos;re not talking about <unk> -- but about progress from three million years and a half million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re creating a new version of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where we &apos;re going to create new <unk> species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> when we think of our <unk> .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion people to <unk> billion in the next 40 years .
Just to give you an example : I was born in <unk> .
Now , there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> ; in the <unk> , and there &apos;s going to be four .
We &apos;re <unk> problems now to find food , water <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , six and a half billion people .
They &apos;re even more <unk> to do it for nine billion .
<unk> over five billion <unk> , over 30 billion <unk> <unk> .
That means 100 million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process to <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
In the more we need to realize that all the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
At the same time , because of the <unk> <unk> all over the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that &apos;s <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry only <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here are <unk> of <unk> and our imagination .
We now have <unk> , because of these <unk> <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think of <unk> these 20 million genes , or <unk> to <unk> the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> , <unk> chemistry or chemistry or chemistry <unk> , or chemistry <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software that we &apos;re working on to be able to <unk> and design species on the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how to be .
We know exactly what their code is .
We &apos;re <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> .
You saw <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We &apos;ve <unk> second and third generation that will be quite soon <unk> from the <unk> to <unk> more <unk> than the <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a very large impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would <unk> <unk> the amount of CO2 in matter before we &apos;re working on design , and we think we can have the first <unk> of <unk> <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> solar <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> , in our <unk> , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> in the deep ocean , about <unk> feet deep to the temperature of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> from CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as energy source .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2 , which can easily be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , we <unk> think that we might be able to <unk> what the basic question of what is life is . We have the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole <unk> for us to <unk> the whole <unk> industry .
<unk> . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can &apos;t you ?
It <unk> a major energy .
<unk> , we &apos;re working on the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk> .
You saw this year with flu , we always <unk> a year and a dollar in less when it comes to find the <unk> <unk> .
I think that you can change building <unk> in <unk> .
Here &apos;s how the future might begin to look at <unk> , now , the tree of the evolution of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and finally cells .
We &apos;re so much better people to <unk> .
Our purpose is to do in a way of living long enough to try to <unk> it . Thank you very much .
First of all , I &apos;m going to show you , the <unk> possible , some fundamental <unk> of the new technology that we took to the <unk> <unk> to a <unk> almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
It &apos;s a environment in which you can <unk> is at local level that you can see in the <unk> of <unk> data .
Here we &apos;re seeing <unk> of <unk> pictures with a kind of <unk> and <unk> , for a fast <unk> , <unk> the images as we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big it is the amount of information that we see , how big it is that big <unk> of data or images .
Most of them are common pictures that we have been doing <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in any moment . It &apos;s also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a book whole , which is not of images .
This is <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
To <unk> that it &apos;s <unk> and not about images , we can do something like that , to make sure it &apos;s a real <unk> of the text , not a picture .
It could be a way that you could read a book <unk> .
You don &apos;t know .
This is an more <unk> example . This is a <unk> number of <unk> .
Every image of a big image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And I really <unk> you and the beautiful experience of reading the real version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> .
We also made something with the corner of this particular number of The <unk> .
We &apos;ve created a <unk> <unk> much higher than what you use in a normal <unk> , and we &apos;ve <unk> you in the <unk> content .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see them here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And that really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
I think this would be able to get to the <unk> and other <unk> <unk> , not to be <unk> .
Of course , <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this one I don &apos;t want to lose time , if we don &apos;t have <unk> to give in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> over the <unk> NASA .
So now we &apos;re going to do something else .
This is actually live on the Web ; you can see it .
It &apos;s a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> <unk> , a very interesting <unk> that was a <unk> student , a <unk> student of Washington , with the aid of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s live on the Web , <unk> by <unk> .
You can see when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from one image to another and have this kind of experience <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of images here actually has meaning .
The <unk> <unk> of computers <unk> these images together , so that they <unk> these pictures together , so that they <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re all <unk> to the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> , and these things were all <unk> to the <unk> <unk> , and these things were all <unk> in .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of <unk> and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> that we &apos;ve done for the first <unk> summer to show you what &apos;s really the key to you , is really the key <unk> of this technology , <unk> . And it &apos;s not quite as <unk> by looking at the <unk> that we &apos;ve done in the website .
We had to <unk> some <unk> and so on .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of types of kinds of <unk> and <unk> , and other <unk> . And so , we <unk> <unk> <unk> an image that <unk> into a picture that has been discovery <unk> to this model .
So , they &apos;re all <unk> <unk> and have all been all <unk> at the <unk> level this way .
And it &apos;s possible to <unk> this <unk> way .
You know , I would never have thought of <unk> to work for it .
It &apos;s very <unk> to <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different kinds of <unk> : from those cell phones to those <unk> <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I can get those <unk> .
Many are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
<unk> here is a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from <unk> to <unk> physics .
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment . This is <unk> data from <unk> by the whole memory <unk> of how to land the Earth , from the whole <unk> <unk> and <unk> all those data together .
All those pictures become <unk> together , greater of the <unk> of the parts .
You have a model of the land that <unk> .
Think of this as the <unk> of <unk> &apos;s work on Earth .
It &apos;s something that <unk> in complexity , as people <unk> it , and the <unk> <unk> for the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> ,
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people .
If someone is a idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name , the picture of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , they &apos;re all those data , and I can use it as a <unk> to <unk> in that space , in that <unk> , using the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all of this is <unk> <unk> that are extremely <unk> of every part of the land , and not only by <unk> <unk> and by <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What &apos;s all the software will allow us to do is that at some point , in the next few years , all the pictures that we &apos;re going to be <unk> <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is we &apos;re going to discover .
It &apos;s <unk> , if you want , in <unk> .
And he &apos;s doing it in the <unk> content .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> information that a lot of these pictures are .
As you make a <unk> research on images , you get a <unk> and the text on the page , it &apos;s a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture , is going to take all your pictures ?
So , the amount of <unk> and <unk> <unk> that <unk> is really huge . It &apos;s a <unk> effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it &apos;s really incredible . <unk> . <unk> .
<unk> : I &apos;m going to <unk> you very much .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is the <unk> that you can live between who has no <unk> <unk> , between who <unk> the wind <unk> , <unk> it in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> it in the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> in the <unk> of plants .
You might think that the <unk> will <unk> more beyond <unk> <unk> , or whether the <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , or whether in <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , and that the idea that we live in there is no sense , but it &apos;s just a model ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , well , <unk> , a lot of <unk> .
And , of course , everybody <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . Everybody <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We have to face the <unk> of death , so we don &apos;t expect them if we were and <unk> --
We all have an art .
What <unk> is the particular <unk> of the song , the <unk> of the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter whether they &apos;re the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> .
And he was my <unk> of the journey in the <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> , on the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> &apos;s mother &apos;s <unk> .
All of these <unk> are <unk> that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And , if you &apos;ll see , it &apos;s a concept that it can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of the world create a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and is important for the <unk> of the planet as as the <unk> <unk> known as <unk> .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the amount of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , ideas , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being by the human imagination .
<unk> is the <unk> <unk> of humanity .
It &apos;s the <unk> of what we can be in the <unk> of what we can be as a kind of <unk> .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> much faster .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all species have been or is on the <unk> of <unk> <unk> -- the diversity of <unk> diversity -- and <unk> in the field of diversity -- and and you don &apos;t even understand a little bit of the <unk> <unk> -- the diversity .
The <unk> of this is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just <unk> by a <unk> or a series of rules .
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of the <unk> that the <unk> of every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a <unk> , a <unk> , a thought , a <unk> of possibility .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we &apos;re sitting here at <unk> , at least half not <unk> in the <unk> of children .
They &apos;re not <unk> to children , which means , which is not to <unk> something , which are already <unk> .
What is more <unk> of being <unk> by the <unk> , of the last to talk about being the language , of not having a <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of someone in the world every two weeks : every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> , and leads with them in the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of a language .
And I know anybody who &apos;s you say , &quot; <unk> &apos;t it better ?
The world would not be a better place if we all the same language ? &quot; <unk> , we all talk . <unk> <unk> . &quot;
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> of a <unk> thing that means that we can &apos;t talk about your language .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we &apos;re <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say &quot; different ways of <unk> , &quot; I mean , in a very different ways of <unk> .
So , for example , this <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , which <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> that you can &apos;t <unk> the blue color because the <unk> is <unk> in the forest because the time <unk> is <unk> in the forest , which <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; : you have to <unk> a person talking about a language .
Everything has <unk> in the past <unk> , but the <unk> is that in these families that are <unk> in these <unk> <unk> , they &apos;re talking about six or seven <unk> because there &apos;s no <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You can start listening and then I &apos;m going to talk .
I was one of the most interesting <unk> that I lived with , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
In <unk> , five <unk> have <unk> contact with a <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;ve done by the top photographs that <unk> them in <unk> that they were <unk> , and they were <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> forest <unk> never saw anything .
They <unk> the <unk> pictures , they <unk> them to a form or a <unk> , and they didn &apos;t know anything , they <unk> that they <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with the <unk> .
But <unk> don &apos;t just <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> with them .
<unk> percent of the <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We went back to eight <unk> and we found two cases of natural death and when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was so <unk> that he &apos;s dead , and then they <unk> it . They <unk> that same . <unk> <unk> , and then they <unk> it . They had a <unk> that .
<unk> were able to recognize the animal that was 40 <unk> <unk> and to <unk> the species .
<unk> the early &apos; <unk> , I was a really interesting <unk> when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> between the <unk> society and the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> to use to do the <unk> .
To make sense of <unk> , I should have to understand the <unk> culture , and the <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a pretty <unk> view of the world .
Very interesting .
If you were to <unk> the <unk> of the world , what would you like ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent is always <unk> out , thinking that <unk> Africa doesn &apos;t have <unk> <unk> . And instead , you know , the <unk> is nothing else that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes interesting is that <unk> is the <unk> of life and death .
So <unk> do <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to live in the <unk> so that for a short <unk> becomes the <unk> .
That &apos;s why the <unk> <unk> to say , &quot; <unk> <unk> go to <unk> the <unk> of God .
We <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> God . &quot;
And what you &apos;re <unk> , is the spirit that you have <unk> , how do you <unk> ?
So you get to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> in the state of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather powerful <unk> of the power of the mind when it was <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> that I &apos;ve lived with the most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> civilization <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> never was <unk> by the <unk> .
In fact , they &apos;re <unk> by a <unk> , but their education is extraordinary <unk> .
<unk> are <unk> by <unk> to <unk> families to three or four years , and live in a world that has been <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> years <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> the nine months of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of mother &apos;s <unk> , now are <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
For all this time , they &apos;re <unk> to the values of their society , <unk> that they <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> .
And so , at the end of this incredible <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> out for the first time , they see a <unk> . And in that moment of <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> , and the sun <unk> <unk> <unk> , all that they learn in theory is <unk> . And in that moment of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , everything they learn in the <unk> . The <unk> does a step back and says ,
&quot; <unk> ? <unk> as I said .
It &apos;s <unk> . Now it &apos;s like you to say , &quot;
They &apos;re called the <unk> <unk> , and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re the <unk> of the world .
This level of <unk> is very important .
When we think of the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the old story of the <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> concept in its <unk> or maybe <unk> and say that these <unk> are closer to Earth .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by <unk> .
There &apos;s no room for these things in the <unk> <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> , but by the time and <unk> , have created a <unk> of the Earth , it &apos;s <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> : the concept that the Earth can only because it &apos;s <unk> by human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
You want to say that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> the mountain is a <unk> spirit that <unk> its <unk> will be a <unk> human being <unk> , and it has a very different relationship with the mountain or that <unk> to a <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> that a mountain is going to be <unk> .
whether it &apos;s a <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is that the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
This made me a human being different from my <unk> friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> that live in the north <unk> , <unk> that live in the world , <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
If we <unk> to <unk> that these <unk> can actually create different , we &apos;re going to understand some of their <unk> <unk> . They <unk> this <unk> .
I took this picture to <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
Some of you have heard about <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes it fascinating is not the potential of the <unk> <unk> , but his <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> .
On one hand , this <unk> <unk> that <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> only one has a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit , but it &apos;s <unk> with the <unk> of a family <unk> said <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you ever see the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> , the <unk> that make a different <unk> , <unk> it <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . <unk> &apos;t create a <unk> of electricity ; it creates a <unk> of reality .
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the &apos; <unk> .
<unk> my <unk> you can &apos;t <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you &apos;re done , you can &apos;t tell anybody to be <unk> . <unk> <unk> . <unk> can &apos;t be <unk> because they &apos;re <unk> by a <unk> that &apos;s <unk> , of course in the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
You can <unk> <unk> only if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now , this is the <unk> that are <unk> in this <unk> are <unk> of the <unk> , the same kind of necessary to <unk> the <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of plants , like these <unk> <unk> two <unk> are not as similar , but that if you <unk> in this way , they create a <unk> version that &apos;s <unk> .
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you <unk> to the <unk> , we &apos;re going to get them to , &quot; <unk> us . &quot;
What does it mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> in the forest , and our eyes <unk> in the forest itself species .
If you <unk> it as you <unk> their <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , you don &apos;t know everything ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you get the <unk> <unk> in a <unk> of the moon and <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
With that you don &apos;t get to <unk> , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , <unk> is that those of us who are <unk> <unk> , but somehow <unk> them to the history of the <unk> of history of our real world than our real world , and it <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk> , or its <unk> <unk> , but rather like the was where we were <unk> and <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> diversity and <unk> and <unk> <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the diversity of the <unk> diversity and <unk> the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All the <unk> were <unk> in a <unk> new possibility for life .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> don &apos;t have <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> by <unk> and <unk> like <unk> don &apos;t have <unk> to be <unk> when they put on the <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> . It &apos;s the power .
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
And if you look at the world , you &apos;ll find that these are not <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of the existence of the <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that lived in the forest until a generation ago , and we <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that seems to be <unk> <unk> by the <unk> that seems to be <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of the <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> .
If we <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the <unk> <unk> of politics .
As the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> physics of a <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> to <unk> , but the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of life , not only is <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it &apos;s part of the development of <unk> .
And you can &apos;t understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you go in the beginning .
I <unk> miles from <unk> in the Western <unk> in China through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> <unk> , I realized what &apos;s behind the <unk> that we &apos;re going to talk about .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> to the <unk> <unk> .
That means that it &apos;s been <unk> in the old Chinese times of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that led the <unk> <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and her <unk> was <unk> .
He was taken of <unk> in <unk> at the age of two <unk> under his <unk> because he couldn &apos;t live without having to live without a living .
The <unk> , which has done the same , was <unk> in <unk> .
One day he <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to work for seven years .
The pain of the <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of <unk> is from there .
<unk> , all of that <unk> to a choice .
How about to live in the world of <unk> or <unk> we want to <unk> the <unk> world of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died said that his greatest fear was that , in our <unk> <unk> , not only <unk> the entire human imagination -- not only <unk> the entire human imagination to a <unk> <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> <unk> of thinking , but one day we <unk> us from a <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it &apos;s <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
<unk> <unk> , which has given us <unk> to <unk> us , which made us <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , by creating the <unk> of the <unk> , and we &apos;re talking about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has to <unk> 300 years old .
The <unk> story I didn &apos;t expect all the challenges of all the challenges that we could <unk> in the <unk> to come .
When these <unk> <unk> in the world , we &apos;re asked what it is human , we &apos;re <unk> with <unk> different <unk> .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of what we are : a <unk> species , which has to <unk> that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are big <unk> moments .
I took this picture on the <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> me , he <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The <unk> government wasn &apos;t always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> for <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> for his life , <unk> <unk> all his <unk> , and he <unk> all his <unk> .
You want to know that <unk> don &apos;t get cold , you &apos;ll see it .
The <unk> of the <unk> were made of <unk> fish .
The <unk> of this man didn &apos;t <unk> from the night or the <unk> that <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> away , it &apos;s <unk> the <unk> in the skin of <unk> and <unk> in their hand . When I did the <unk> , he <unk> them by it by them , he <unk> them by them by them , they <unk> them by it .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> has created a <unk> , he <unk> another dog , and he &apos;s <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> you &apos;re going to talk to <unk> with nothing ? &#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; And this , in different ways , &#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; is the &#93; <unk> of all the <unk> in the world .
<unk> <unk> the government <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of an area , bigger than in California and <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s their new <unk> . It &apos;s called <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s all the <unk> resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> at least , at least , to the people in the planet , <unk> that they &apos;re not <unk> at all .
It &apos;s for someone , it &apos;s home .
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that we <unk> in the <unk> . And for us all , the dreams of these children , become part of the <unk> <unk> of hope .
To end , we &apos;re <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> that the <unk> never <unk> .
I would say , &quot; <unk> , &quot;
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and perhaps we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our site <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> our <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in the <unk> to bring our public in places to <unk> <unk> , where we have seen and , <unk> <unk> , <unk> a <unk> , for a <unk> , <unk> a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , the world <unk> to <unk> diversity , and we have to find a way of <unk> diversity in a <unk> world and <unk>
where the <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I &apos;ve written in this book that I hope you &apos;ve already heard and you &apos;ve already heard some <unk> , in case you don &apos;t know .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
<unk> <unk> what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all the societies <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> : &quot; If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens . &quot; The way is to do it is to <unk> the <unk> freedom . &quot;
The reason is , on one side , in the fact that freedom is itself a value , is useful , useful , <unk> for human beings .
<unk> is the fact that if we &apos;re <unk> , every one of us can do it for it to <unk> to do everything that <unk> our <unk> , without any <unk> that we &apos;re in the name .
The way to <unk> freedom is <unk> .
More choices and more choices are <unk> , and more <unk> , is their <unk> .
This , <unk> , is so <unk> <unk> in the society that no one <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
And it &apos;s also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you a few examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I was just <unk> on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy to a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that nobody <unk> already , in your <unk> .
That &apos;s what the <unk> is .
Then you go to the <unk> store for buy a <unk> : <unk> , radio , <unk> , radio , <unk> , radio , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there &apos;s a large number of <unk> .
We can do six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one <unk> .
<unk> <unk> there is a <unk> choice .
<unk> <unk> : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the <unk> services , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> they were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
You get the phone , you don &apos;t <unk> it .
A <unk> of that , by the way , was that the phone call never <unk> .
These days have gone .
We have now a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , especially cell phones .
Here &apos;s cell phones of the future .
My <unk> is the one in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
If you don &apos;t have that <unk> yet <unk> in the house , you &apos;re very <unk> certain that you can see .
And what happens is that people <unk> in the <unk> and ask the question , and ask this question . And you know what &apos;s the answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t make things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , you get the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : it doesn &apos;t happen in the United States that you &apos;re <unk> from the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> you to do .
Instead , <unk> by <unk> , and the <unk> says , &quot; OK , we can do A , or <unk> , &quot; A <unk> , &quot; <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; <unk> , what would you do ? &quot;
And the <unk> says , &quot; He has these <unk> and these <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> and these <unk> . &quot;
&quot; What do you do ? &quot;
And you ask , &quot; <unk> if you were me , what would you say ? &quot;
And the <unk> , &quot; I &apos;m not her . &quot;
<unk> we call it &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; I &apos;ll see it as a beautiful thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not a <unk> the weight and the responsibility of the decision that you know something , <unk> the <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> , and almost certainly is <unk> -- and , of course , is <unk> -- and not in the <unk> <unk> to make them make decisions about -- and then not in the <unk> <unk> to make decisions about it .
There &apos;s a huge <unk> of products , which is <unk> to people like me and you , that if you think about it , it doesn &apos;t make sense that we can &apos;t <unk> .
But if we can &apos;t <unk> , why do we <unk> them ?
The answer is , which they want to <unk> us to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> so <unk> is a matter of our <unk> now is a question of choice , as you see in this <unk> . &quot; We don &apos;t want to <unk> the kids . We want to be no longer to <unk> . <unk> : we have to <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
That means that every <unk> , at the <unk> , you have to decide what you want to be .
<unk> to the family and <unk> , a time perspective , the common perspective , almost to anybody , had that you <unk> the <unk> as soon as possible .
The only real choice was to the who , not when , and what to do after .
<unk> , everything is really to play .
They &apos;re going to be very smart students , and they <unk> their 20 percent less job than a time .
And they don &apos;t get <unk> , because they &apos;re not <unk> .
but why I &apos;m <unk> , you know , you &apos;re going to say , &quot; <unk> <unk> or not ? Do you want to do that now ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> later ? I have to think before your children or your career ? &quot;
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this <unk> doesn &apos;t <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and do not <unk> <unk> .
And they really have to do that . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the job : we &apos;re <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> , because the technology allows us to work every day , from every corner of the planet , <unk> that by the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> , and I &apos;m not going to tell anybody where the <unk> works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this incredible <unk> of choice ? Is it just <unk> of choice ? It &apos;s that we have to decide , <unk> at any time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son to play <unk> , with the <unk> in one <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> on the <unk> .
And even though they &apos;re all <unk> , every minute that we see our son <unk> the <unk> , we &apos;re also <unk> , &quot; Do I have to answer this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this <unk> ? I have to take this letter ? I have to take this letter ? I have to <unk> this letter ? I have to say that . &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , that &apos;s all the experience of your son very different than what would have been in other conditions .
So , any of you look , and small things , big objects and big , objects and life , life is a matter of choices .
And once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but not all was a question of choice .
The world of today is this : <unk> is , &quot; Is it a <unk> thing <unk> , or <unk> ? &quot;
The answer is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the <unk> .
<unk> this choice two two <unk> effects two people on people .
The first , <unk> , is that it <unk> instead of <unk> .
With a lot of <unk> between you and you get , it &apos;s very difficult to do .
I &apos;ll give you an example of <unk> : a <unk> study on <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> different companies , the <unk> <unk> company , with about a million <unk> <unk> in <unk> different companies .
What she found out is that for every 10 <unk> that are <unk> in more , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> two percent .
With 50 <unk> , there &apos;s 10 percent less than it &apos;s 10 percent <unk> in less than when they &apos;re available for only . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> between them , is it &apos;s hard to decide , and choice <unk> is <unk> .
And <unk> , and again in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course <unk> never comes to .
<unk> that doesn &apos;t mean just these <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don &apos;t have enough money , it wants to say that the decision is so <unk> that we also <unk> the <unk> <unk> of work .
They &apos;re not going to be <unk> , until five <unk> <unk> per year from the <unk> of work , which would be <unk> <unk> .
So , <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices .
And I think it &apos;s going to change the world like this .
&quot; And finally , &quot; <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
I really want to make the right decision , if it &apos;s for the <unk> , isn &apos;t it ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and you get the wrong <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice , at the end is less <unk> by the result of how we <unk> states with less <unk> .
And that for several reasons .
One of them is that with a lot of <unk> between the <unk> , and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> us to <unk> them to <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> that decision that <unk> us to <unk> us to <unk> them , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> that decision ,
even when it was a decision that &apos;s a decision .
The more choices you have , it &apos;s easier to <unk> that &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there &apos;s what <unk> call .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well known as the value that we give things <unk> from what <unk> .
<unk> , you know , when you have a lot of <unk> , it &apos;s easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and be less <unk> than the <unk> <unk> , and be less <unk> than the <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;ll <unk> with all the ones that are not in New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably <unk> .
There &apos;s this <unk> to the <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It &apos;s all about them .
It &apos;s not going to do anything . But what he thinks , &quot; Well , <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; All my <unk> <unk> are away . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> right in front of the home . &quot;
And it <unk> two weeks <unk> from the idea that &apos;s <unk> -- every day -- the possibility of <unk> where you want .
The <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when we have a choice of <unk> .
And the more of the <unk> that we have from <unk> , the more the <unk> <unk> <unk> us <unk> against the <unk> .
Here &apos;s another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot .
It &apos;s about living the moment , and maybe the <unk> of the way .
But the most important point is that anything you want , you &apos;re not going to be doing other .
The things that don &apos;t <unk> have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> point : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk> .
It &apos;s almost always <unk> .
Once they had a <unk> <unk> , and they were <unk> , and they were <unk> , and they were <unk> , only after they had a <unk> and make a lot of times , you could go well .
So , I &apos;m going to <unk> a couple of new when the <unk> were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> said , &quot; Do you want to <unk> them , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
<unk> them wants to <unk> with <unk> or <unk> ? &quot; <unk> or &quot;
&quot; <unk> wants to <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> wants to <unk> or <unk> ? &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; <unk> to <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a while I was able to say , &quot; I want the <unk> <unk> , which was the only guy , &quot; he had no idea what it was , so one . I &apos;m not going to have to <unk> me , and then I was <unk> <unk> , and then <unk> out of the <unk> <unk> , and the best <unk> of <unk> I &apos;ve ever had .
It was <unk> . I had all that choice was better .
But I was worse .
Why ? I have written a book whole for <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that I had that I had to do , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I was <unk> <unk> . I didn &apos;t know anything about it when I was just one like , but when I was 100 different , <unk> , at least one guy had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After I had <unk> that I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in people &apos;s lives not doing <unk> the <unk> that these have <unk> <unk> that these have <unk> to the <unk> themselves .
And that <unk> <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of the <unk> world , it makes it <unk> .
Because if I <unk> it , I don &apos;t understand what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more about this .
&quot; You were better when you were worse , &quot; The reason that was better when you were worse was even worse , when it was even worse , you could <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live in -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things to the <unk> .
You &apos;ve never <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , your <unk> , you know , you &apos;re <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; Yes , you want to . &quot;
I mean -- little <unk> moment -- which I &apos;m really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn &apos;t have done better , I didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
But <unk> isn &apos;t always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> when there &apos;s only that kind of <unk> is that when you &apos;re not <unk> , and you &apos;re <unk> , &quot; Why ? &quot;
Who is <unk> ? &quot; <unk> , the answer is <unk> .
The world is <unk> . What do I could do it do ?
When you have hundreds of types of <unk> , and you get a <unk> , and you know who is the <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> .
I could have done better .
With hundreds of <unk> , you can &apos;t have <unk> for <unk> .
So when people are making decisions , even if the result is <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> and they &apos;re <unk> to them .
In the last years , the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only one , but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is really <unk> as people have experiences because the <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation think that <unk> is they are .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better , <unk> , but we &apos;re worse .
Let me show you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all get to good and is completely <unk> . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no <unk> that a little bit better than not <unk> , but it doesn &apos;t <unk> at all , but it doesn &apos;t <unk> that much choice is better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a <unk> value , <unk> . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m really sure we &apos;ve <unk> from a piece of the level of the choices that we have our lives .
Now , from a <unk> point of view -- I almost finished -- from the <unk> point of view , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What &apos;s all of this choice in <unk> society is <unk> .
There are many places in the world , and you have <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that they have <unk> .
The problem is they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> that I &apos;m talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> talked about yesterday about how <unk> those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to be <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> of money .
I mean these choices , <unk> and <unk> , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
They make worse worse .
If a little bit of what we do in our society <unk> choice was <unk> in those where people have too few possibilities , it would not be just about <unk> , but also our <unk> .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income does good choice to everybody -- not just to the poor -- not just to the poor <unk> -- because of this choice in <unk> that <unk> us .
To finish , &quot; You know , you can become everything you want , &quot;
<unk> , people from culture , I said , &quot; What are you going to do that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s <unk> you can &apos;t do anything in a glass <unk> . &quot;
&quot; A <unk> imagination , a <unk> view of the world -- &quot;
and I <unk> it like this , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I realized that fish knows that that fish knows the long knows .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you <unk> it in <unk> , so that &quot; everything is possible . &quot; You know , &quot; You know , &quot; you can &apos;t <unk> the freedom . &quot; You get the <unk> . &quot;
If you <unk> it so that you can <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
Everybody needs a <unk> .
This is almost certainly almost certainly <unk> , maybe for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
