<unk> year , I showed this <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years , has been <unk> the United States of the United States , <unk> , <unk> 40 percent .
I &apos;m going to do this <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is , in a certain sense , the heart of the climate system .
They <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
As you see , it <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That &apos;s the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , five years old , it &apos;s like blood , you can see that the body .
<unk> years , it &apos;s been <unk> for this .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> the ground around the <unk> of the <unk> around the ocean where there are enormous <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , are <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , that <unk> may <unk> , that <unk> , <unk> this point of not <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> the <unk> is already <unk> by water .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> last <unk> team .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : She &apos;s fine . The question is , if we also do it .
One reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the north .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> had never <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
If you want to know how <unk> the <unk> level to <unk> <unk> on <unk> , here is where the sea <unk> .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
On the other side of the planet : <unk> , the largest <unk> of ice on the planet .
<unk> month scientists have <unk> that the ice <unk> is in <unk> , and that the <unk> <unk> , which <unk> on some <unk> <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> feet of the <unk> , like <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the largest third <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which few years ago , <unk> .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population <unk> <unk> by the <unk> water from the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : this <unk> is the source of the water <unk> of this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same thing happens to <unk> water .
In California , in California , <unk> <unk> is <unk> of 40 percent .
The <unk> <unk> are in crisis .
The <unk> , as you read , they &apos;re <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in the world <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and without <unk> .
<unk> times over the last 30 years , <unk> than <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> .
If you look at it in the <unk> context , you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we &apos;ve <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every day .
Look at <unk> the area of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and on both the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , where there is a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean .
The largest cause of global warming , together to <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
The oil is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And you &apos;re <unk> to build many other <unk> <unk> .
But we &apos;re starting to a <unk> of direction .
These are the <unk> projects over the last few years and some <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And every way , there &apos;s a political <unk> in our country .
The <unk> of <unk> and oil have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I <unk> image something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen the <unk> of the <unk> .
This is the second largest flow in America .
It &apos;s happened around <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> â™« <unk> <unk> is a <unk> and happy .
It &apos;s <unk> here in America , and it &apos;s <unk> our economy .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In <unk> : <unk> , you get a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
The largest <unk> society <unk> on the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
So , the <unk> for the <unk> <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , one part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> , we see <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> <unk> in our business .
So , we have a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> for public health and <unk> the truth about <unk> .
In fact , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it &apos;s <unk> -- it &apos;s got a good <unk> .
So we didn &apos;t <unk> about climate change .
We &apos;re going to do that .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> -- you &apos;ve heard about it very much .
So I &apos;m going to take a <unk> structure for how <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! The cars are a little <unk> , but this is the sound of <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> is between the major <unk> of global warming , but the <unk> technology of <unk> that you see changes everything .
Let &apos;s look at : this is the <unk> technology of <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : America &apos;s in the crisis ; the <unk> , national security crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all of : our <unk> <unk> from <unk> , like <unk> and oil <unk> .
Now , there &apos;s a new solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan to <unk> America to work , <unk> more <unk> , and help <unk> the global warming .
<unk> , a solution that we try to solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
<unk> : This is the last .
<unk> : <unk> : This is about <unk> energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> , <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , sun , <unk> , a new <unk> network .
<unk> <unk> two : <unk> <unk> for jobs well .
<unk> : <unk> America . It &apos;s time to be <unk> .
In the <unk> : A <unk> <unk> says , &quot; If you want to go for yourself , go for yourself .
If you want to go away , you go back , you go together . &quot;
We have to go far , fast .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED I did an <unk> on <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to try to <unk> about how the car works .
So here we go . And for the ones that the other time didn &apos;t have , the <unk> is the largest experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
<unk> is to <unk> the conditions that were <unk> less than a <unk> <unk> of a second from the universe -- until <unk> million times a second .
All this is simply <unk> .
This is the <unk> car .
<unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk> .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> feet , and it &apos;s <unk> feet .
This is a <unk> image of <unk> in building so you can see the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> last year .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was because of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
It &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> of particles who had done everything around the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles in the <unk> .
In other words , when I <unk> that image the <unk> , the <unk> machine , the <unk> , which is a big <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if this was to do that , when someone <unk> on Google and <unk> that the <unk> page was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a <unk> impact over to the scientific .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the car , had to just these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you <unk> and <unk> , &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot;
And they can do that because when they &apos;re very <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees , at least a <unk> temperature at the space of stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think these <unk> <unk> <unk> than 20 <unk> , and you have <unk> about 30 <unk> .
They have about 50 <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We have them <unk> and <unk> .
Now , they &apos;re <unk> now everybody &apos;s <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> <unk> will be again .
The <unk> , and we <unk> to get some of the data to <unk> or <unk> , and continue the way we <unk> to find out what the <unk> of the universe are <unk> .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering . It &apos;s easy to <unk> .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s the value of things like <unk> .
I &apos;d like to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> , in <unk> of <unk> experiments of <unk> , his <unk> was <unk> , and her <unk> was , &quot; <unk> is that there are no <unk> to <unk> human mind how <unk> that are <unk> , that there are no <unk> in nature , that our <unk> are <unk> , and that our <unk> are <unk> , and that we don &apos;t have <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to start when , from children , <unk> with <unk> .
As we <unk> as <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , actually <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> to the way most of the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with objects , together with <unk> objects , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started <unk> . I started <unk> . I started <unk> , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having the only <unk> of <unk> as a digital <unk> that has <unk> <unk> on a <unk> , <unk> <unk> a information with both hands ,
and we &apos;re going to <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that I decided that I decided to explore the answer , building the <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer like a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer like a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , they can <unk> their <unk> , and they have a screen and they have a screen and they <unk> .
But <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> it .
The <unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> the digital information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement of the other people , and as they become more <unk> , <unk> of their <unk> , of how we <unk> them , we can explore new <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So let &apos;s start with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you of the video -- if you put it in one direction , the <unk> video so , if you <unk> on the other side .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
If you <unk> them , you <unk> to what it &apos;s going around them .
If they come up , <unk> and they can <unk> it a little bit .
If they come up , <unk> and they can <unk> it a little bit .
They also <unk> their <unk> and <unk> .
We then realized that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> was the <unk> of data , for example , <unk> , like , &quot; <unk> , &quot; a color like it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk> and I can <unk> for <unk> in the central color in the central one , where they <unk> .
and I can <unk> it to <unk> the color in the central color , where they <unk> .
If we <unk> too much , we can <unk> it a little bit .
I &apos;m also <unk> <unk> possibility , like <unk> , <unk> , math and <unk> games where people can try and <unk> things , and <unk> the results immediately .
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a <unk> of <unk> I do with a <unk> <unk> program .
We have a game here that &apos;s <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at any <unk> <unk> a letter in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , at any <unk> <unk> <unk> a letter to <unk> , and while I was <unk> <unk> <unk> on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try to do .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the children <unk> in <unk> to the <unk> <unk> , I &apos;ve done it , and I &apos;ve <unk> a video .
They &apos;re very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things about this <unk> is that you don &apos;t have to give people many <unk> .
I just say , &quot; <unk> of words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do . &quot;
Here &apos;s another people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , right there .
It actually wanted to <unk> <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
And I had to build a tool for the <unk> of <unk> . He &apos;s <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now , he brought a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
You &apos;re work ! Yeah !
So , we <unk> <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
-- <unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with the final end , and he can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with the final end , and he can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time to show you is a tool that made of <unk> , to <unk> and <unk> music .
It &apos;s a tool , that &apos;s recently made of <unk> and <unk> music .
The <unk> here is <unk> by <unk> like basic , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of these has four different <unk> , and you can choose what to use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> <unk> to your <unk> .
And we just <unk> a <unk> <unk> , &quot; sound &quot; and a <unk> . &quot;
These are actually <unk> you can control from me , like <unk> and <unk> .
They <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are the <unk> effects of time and <unk> , who <unk> to the whole sequence .
<unk> how it works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> , <unk> a <unk> <unk> , <unk> in a series , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
Now let &apos;s <unk> a <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : Now <unk> of <unk> --
<unk> : And now , I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> , so I can control the <unk> .
<unk> : I can <unk> the entire sequence a <unk> time from one side to the other side .
<unk> : And now , we &apos;re going to <unk> the bottom to give more <unk> .
<unk> : I can <unk> the sequence &quot; <unk> . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> it , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
And now , finally , I can <unk> the entire sequence on the left the <unk> <unk> the <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> more and more <unk> to how they work and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show one of this <unk> of this <unk> , and also some possibilities we try to bring out of the results .
The concept I want to <unk> is that it &apos;s <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> <unk> , that <unk> information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I can &apos;t see the time of talking to all of you .
I &apos;m a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it &apos;s more than this , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the <unk> of my life .
And it doesn &apos;t look <unk> .
But I said , something particular happened was <unk> in my life and in my career , and he brought me to <unk> the whole relationship with this whole job .
The particular thing is I wrote this book , this <unk> called &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> . &quot;
And the result is that <unk> everywhere in the time , people <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I &apos;m going to <unk> now and say , &quot; You don &apos;t have any fear of them not be able to do better ? &quot;
You don &apos;t have to <unk> write for all life that we can create a book that can <unk> someone to create a book that can <unk> someone ? &quot;
What can you <unk> to someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , to me , I remember , over 20 years ago , when I was <unk> to say , I was a <unk> .
I was <unk> to the same <unk> <unk> .
And people say , &quot; Don &apos;t <unk> to not be able to have success ? &quot; Don &apos;t <unk> to have success ? &quot; Don &apos;t you know that they have success ? &quot; Don &apos;t <unk> to be <unk> ? &quot;
Do you have not fear that the <unk> <unk> you ?
You don &apos;t have to do this <unk> for all life without any life that nothing has ever come out and die on a <unk> of <unk> dreams with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
So you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
Yeah , I &apos;m afraid of all of the things .
I always <unk> .
And I &apos;ve also <unk> of many other things that people could not <unk> .
As <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as it &apos;s about the <unk> and I thought and <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It &apos;s <unk> that everybody <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job you feel to do .
But what is the particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about health <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not ?
As my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> , and I don &apos;t remember , I was asked for the only time in her <unk> , if she had <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
We never -- that <unk> <unk> <unk> , how did that ?
Don &apos;t we <unk> that , <unk> ?
<unk> , the <unk> engineers like <unk> didn &apos;t have certainly in <unk> , <unk> the <unk> to be <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We have enough , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> , but we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And the other people who look at the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often for them .
And the ones that have not <unk> to be <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before I die , <unk> , <unk> said , &quot; Every my book <unk> me a little more <unk> . &quot; A <unk> <unk> <unk> about work of their life .
But we didn &apos;t know about <unk> when we say it because we &apos;ve heard these things so long , we have completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> , in some way , <unk> , and that <unk> , at the end .
And the question I want to <unk> you to all over here today is : Can you agree with this idea ?
You &apos;re OK , this thing -- because it &apos;s also <unk> from a <unk> distance to me not .
I think it &apos;s <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s also <unk> , and I don &apos;t want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better <unk> our <unk> to live .
And I certainly know , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I am in my career .
<unk> -- look -- look , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m a <unk> .
I &apos;ve still about four <unk> of work in me .
And it &apos;s very <unk> that everything we &apos;re going to be <unk> by the world as the work that <unk> after the <unk> of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we &apos;re all <unk> friends , is <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> , what thought !
You know , this is the kind of <unk> that <unk> a person to start <unk> <unk> to nine <unk> at nine <unk> in the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I could continue doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so , it looks to me , after many <unk> , who the way to work and <unk> and <unk> to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to have to find a distance of me , which I &apos;m <unk> , and the natural <unk> about what I &apos;m <unk> about , and I &apos;m going to <unk> it for last year , how we would do it , to look through other societies to see if you have better ideas and more <unk> than to see if you have better ideas and more <unk> than <unk> .
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that <unk> me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> because they <unk> in <unk> and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don &apos;t believe that creativity is <unk> by men , OK ?
It turns out that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to the men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for reasons and <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> <unk> <unk> from far .
The <unk> were the same idea , but <unk> that sort of the spirit without a <unk> .
The <unk> , because the <unk> didn &apos;t really know that a <unk> was particularly <unk> someone who was <unk> .
I thought a <unk> was this <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , literally in the <unk> of the study of a artist , a little <unk> , and I <unk> out to <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the work of that the artist and <unk> the work of that .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , that &apos;s the distance I talk -- that <unk> <unk> you from the results of your work .
And everybody <unk> that was the way we <unk> , right ?
So the <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like too <unk> , right ?
If your work was <unk> <unk> , you didn &apos;t <unk> all the <unk> , you all know , you &apos;d have been <unk> <unk> by this <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it wasn &apos;t all <unk> , right ?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and everything <unk> , and we <unk> this great idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe above all and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
This was the <unk> principle of <unk> and people started to think that creativity is <unk> <unk> by <unk> .
And for the first time in history , you start <unk> to <unk> this or the artist <unk> to a rather than a <unk> person with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think people , a simple person to believe that it was like a source , like the source , the <unk> and the <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> is a responsibility to <unk> too big to give <unk> human .
It &apos;s like to ask someone to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> the <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think it &apos;s , the question becomes , the question it becomes , and now ?
Can we do that ?
They &apos;re going to go back to a <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe it doesn &apos;t .
Maybe we can &apos;t <unk> 500 years of <unk> thought in a talk of 18 minutes .
And there are probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on their own <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you <unk> , you <unk> , you <unk> , you <unk> , you <unk> , you <unk> , you <unk> , you <unk> , you <unk> , <unk> , about <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
You probably won &apos;t all <unk> about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to <unk> you is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t we <unk> this way ?
Because more sense of everything I &apos;ve ever heard about to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process of <unk> .
A process of the way everyone ever <unk> to do something -- so , basically , all of course , all of you -- you know , you don &apos;t <unk> <unk> .
And in fact , it can sometimes seem <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> <unk> , who has now 90 years , but it was a <unk> for all life and said that during his life and said that during his <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> , and I <unk> it , inside the <unk> , and I <unk> it , inside the <unk> .
He said , he was like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> to her <unk> to her from <unk> .
He <unk> it to come , because he <unk> the earth under his feet .
We decided to have one thing to do at that point and it was , words , &quot; <unk> like a <unk> . &quot;
And so he went back to home and he was <unk> by this <unk> , and he didn &apos;t have any other that take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> , and he <unk> on the page .
<unk> times you can &apos;t be <unk> enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without getting to get to home and she would <unk> them up and she would <unk> it to <unk> through the <unk> , looking for how she said , &quot; she said , &quot; another <unk> . &quot;
And then there were the time -- this piece never -- there were moments .
So , he was <unk> at home and he was looking for the <unk> and he was looking at the <unk> <unk> right in , and he was <unk> , and then he said , he was like , if he <unk> with the other hand and the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> and the <unk> in his body and <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk> , but in the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
So when I <unk> it -- it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not all my <unk> process -- I &apos;m not a <unk> !
I &apos;m a <unk> , and my <unk> way of <unk> is ; I &apos;m <unk> at the same <unk> every day and <unk> and work <unk> on it .
But even I have <unk> against that thing , I &apos;ve <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I think many of you <unk> the fact .
You know , even though the work and ideas <unk> me <unk> from a certain source I couldn &apos;t <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> to it in a way we don &apos;t have to <unk> your head , but rather , that <unk> <unk> us ?
As I think , the best example , I &apos;ve <unk> is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;ve <unk> several years ago for a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> <unk> <unk> , trying to control , <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , he <unk> , and he was <unk> on a day , and he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , <unk> everything .
<unk> fast and everything in a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> , who gets in his head as <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , you know , <unk> , and she wants , you know , <unk> , and the <unk> , but it doesn &apos;t know how to <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
So , it starts to feel this old kind of old <unk> <unk> to him , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose it from this <unk> song .
I &apos;m not <unk> enough and I can &apos;t <unk> . &quot;
And instead of going to go to the <unk> , they <unk> .
<unk> the whole process and made something completely new .
He just <unk> the sky and said , &quot; <unk> , you don &apos;t see what I &apos;m <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Do you think it &apos;s a song about to write a song about ?
If you really want to <unk> , you know , <unk> at a <unk> moment when I can <unk> care for you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> other people today .
<unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And his <unk> process after this .
It wasn &apos;t the work , it was still <unk> as <unk> .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that he <unk> the <unk> that he <unk> <unk> away from where he was , <unk> that she didn &apos;t have to be a <unk> and <unk> .
But I <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation with <unk> and this <unk> thing , and <unk> , but it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
And as I &apos;m <unk> that story to change some way I &apos;m going to change a little bit .
This idea , I &apos;m <unk> when I was <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; and I &apos;m going to be in one of the <unk> of the <unk> that we &apos;re all working when we &apos;re working on something and we &apos;re not going to be <unk> , that &apos;s going to be a <unk> , which is going to be the <unk> book .
Not only <unk> , the <unk> book .
And I started thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I &apos;m <unk> to <unk> that <unk> to the air and <unk> us .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> corner of the room .
And I said to <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , what , both of us know that if this book will not be <unk> <unk> , you know , you &apos;re not going to be <unk> my , no ?
Because as you see I &apos;m <unk> everything I have , I &apos;m not <unk> about that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , I don &apos;t do anything .
I started writing the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to please , you know , I &apos;m <unk> to do my part . &quot; Because I &apos;m -- I &apos;m <unk> to do in the <unk> of Africa , the people <unk> to <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the moon , <unk> and music that you <unk> it for hours and until <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because <unk> were <unk> and <unk> .
But every while , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these artists <unk> actually .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you &apos;ve all seen , at some point , a <unk> like this .
It was like time , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it wasn &apos;t doing anything different from the usually , like <unk> <unk> <unk> before , but everything <unk> .
And all of a sudden not just as a human .
But it <unk> up from <unk> and <unk> in fire <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , he <unk> it up with his name .
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , &quot; God , &quot; God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , you still feel , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , you still feel <unk> in <unk> or in <unk> .
In <unk> , when an artist did something impossible , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it &apos;s <unk> because we need it .
But the problem comes after , to the <unk> itself , when you <unk> and <unk> and <unk> that are the 11 of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> God <unk> . And the <unk> of God is no longer .
It &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and maybe I never <unk> to that <unk> <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God again while I &apos;m <unk> , and what has to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so <unk> if you can &apos;t believe , <unk> , <unk> , the most <unk> <unk> of your being come from yourself .
But let me just <unk> you that you &apos;re <unk> from a source of this <unk> part of your life you have to go to another when you &apos;re done .
And , you know , if we think this way everything changes .
And so I started <unk> , and it &apos;s certainly how I <unk> it for several months during the <unk> <unk> that I was <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of my success .
And I have to keep <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , I don &apos;t fear .
Don &apos;t <unk> . You just <unk> your work .
<unk> to <unk> for your own part , whatever it can be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If you <unk> , you will <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for one moment through your <unk> , then you &apos;re <unk> !
<unk> , you do the same <unk> .
And I said , &quot; <unk> ! &quot; to you do it .
I think , and I think it &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; to you do the same , even for <unk> love human and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> : <unk> !
As you know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects on the human genome , about what it can <unk> and discovery of new genes .
We &apos;re now <unk> a new <unk> : we &apos;ve started <unk> the biology and now starting to <unk> the biology code we &apos;re <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We &apos;ve always tried to <unk> big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; is something that many <unk> <unk> I think have <unk> <unk> to understand how much <unk> . &quot;
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to <unk> terms .
We &apos;re <unk> for almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome has <unk> <unk> from the world &apos;s world &apos;s <unk> .
Now we &apos;re going to <unk> : Can we <unk> life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> species from the most small genome between those that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> a little more small .
We &apos;re able to <unk> a <unk> of genes about 500 are here .
But when we look at his <unk> map , it &apos;s <unk> simple than our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at a time , it &apos;s very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell .
So I thought the only way to <unk> this <unk> was <unk> this <unk> in a way to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of &quot; <unk> . &quot; Can we <unk> a <unk> ? &quot;
Can you create these big molecules that we &apos;ve never done before ?
And in case , we can make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> material <unk> .
The speed we are able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the <unk> code , instead , <unk> rather slowly , but it &apos;s <unk> .
And our most <unk> results <unk> on a <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve been <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> many <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before <unk> experiments .
But we found that <unk> DNA of it is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that we have little <unk> of DNA <unk> , of <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> process : the more <unk> is .
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , <unk> from information <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a little <unk> that you <unk> bacteria .
We have designed <unk> , <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> material <unk> , and we <unk> it in the bacteria , and they <unk> the <unk> particles .
The <unk> particles have been <unk> by the cells , they <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I talked about recently with the <unk> industry that they have <unk> this model .
They have more <unk> than you .
I think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we could do the bigger things .
They wanted to build the entire <unk> of <unk> .
They &apos;re more than <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we thought about <unk> in the size of the virus , so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> are the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> with information <unk> in a computer , these have to be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> , the <unk> <unk> was to <unk> <unk> .
We found out , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If we used that original sequence never <unk> states to do it .
One of the process is to design <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of the <unk> to build smaller <unk> than <unk> .
<unk> elements here .
You &apos;ve probably read that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> <unk> together , and there &apos;s a <unk> order of <unk> for any <unk> .
So we can use the <unk> code for writing , <unk> , <unk> .
So , what we did at the beginning was <unk> .
Some have been <unk> by the fact that it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
We &apos;ve designed these <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> <unk> .
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In any step we have produced these <unk> in <unk> so that we &apos;re <unk> to create a extremely <unk> <unk> as you &apos;ll be able to create a very <unk> <unk> as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to <unk> the process .
So , this looks like a <unk> <unk> .
When we go to these <unk> <unk> , more than 100 <unk> <unk> <unk> , no longer we &apos;re <unk> directly in the <unk> <unk> .
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> tools of <unk> biology .
So we have <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA to <unk> the DNA that can <unk> the <unk> .
Here &apos;s an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In 12 hours , it &apos;s <unk> exactly as it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely <unk> .
You have to live under <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> that life <unk> in space , and they &apos;re <unk> to find new <unk> <unk> of water .
In fact , NASA <unk> showed that this happens .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we &apos;ve built these <unk> , just using the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a big <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that I &apos;m <unk> a time of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we &apos;ve done a little time .
They &apos;re more than <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s the largest <unk> of a <unk> structure ever <unk> by man .
He has a <unk> <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 without spaces , we <unk> pages to <unk> this <unk> code .
Now , how do we do it work ? How can we <unk> it ?
Of course , with a virus is a <unk> game .
It &apos;s a little <unk> when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> when it &apos;s <unk> cells like our : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the process of <unk> .
In <unk> , the <unk> is instead of <unk> in the cell , but we &apos;ve <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re able to do a <unk> <unk> from a cell to another and <unk> .
We &apos;ve <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> species .
The two are different as humans from <unk> .
We &apos;ve <unk> some <unk> <unk> in a way that you could decide what to choose for this <unk> .
He then <unk> it with the <unk> <unk> to <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And we <unk> that we didn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried still <unk> to <unk> them in there .
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere , <unk> , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So , who thinks in evolution as a <unk> <unk> <unk> , it doesn &apos;t <unk> much of biology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the DNA .
The <unk> that was in the cell didn &apos;t <unk> one .
The <unk> <unk> we have <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material , he <unk> it , and we &apos;re <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk> .
It &apos;s become blue because of the genes we have <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species , you go <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> all in a new species , <unk> on the new software we &apos;ve <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the <unk> code exactly the <unk> <unk> exactly what we &apos;ve <unk> you .
Now , this may be <unk> <unk> , but <unk> the software DNA , we can change things in a <unk> way .
Now , I &apos;ve already <unk> that you &apos;re not talking about <unk> -- but <unk> progress from three million years and a half million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> in which we &apos;re going to create new <unk> about this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> when we think of our <unk> .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion people to <unk> billion over the next 40 years .
Just to give you an example : I was born in <unk> .
Now , there are three people on the planet to <unk> in <unk> ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re <unk> now to find food , water and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> for six billion people .
We &apos;re even <unk> to do it for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , over 30 billion <unk> of <unk> .
That means 100 million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process to <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
In the more we have to realize the whole <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
In the day today , because of the <unk> <unk> in the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> <unk> only a <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here is <unk> <unk> of <unk> and our imagination .
We have now <unk> , because of these <unk> <unk> <unk> , that we &apos;re able to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think of <unk> these 20 million genes , or try to <unk> <unk> <unk> to make <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology <unk> now that in the last 20 years .
And it &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> , chemistry or chemistry , or <unk> production , <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> on which we &apos;re working on to be able to <unk> and design species to make it .
Well , we don &apos;t know how to be .
We know exactly what their <unk> code .
We &apos;re now <unk> about <unk> <unk> .
You also saw you that <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We &apos;ve <unk> <unk> and third generation that we have <unk> enough <unk> from <unk> to <unk> more value as the <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> to <unk> the CO2 in matter , and we think we can have this purpose , and we think we can have the first <unk> <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> solar <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> around the world , we &apos;ve found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we have <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> in the deep ocean , at about <unk> feet deep to the temperature of <unk> water .
<unk> <unk> from CO2 <unk> by using <unk> as energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand whether we can easily <unk> CO2 , which can easily be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So we <unk> we think that we might be able to <unk> what the basic question , &quot; What is life is , &quot; We have the <unk> goal of <unk> the entire <unk> of <unk> the entire <unk> industry .
<unk> . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t ?
We &apos;re going to <unk> a <unk> of energy .
<unk> , we &apos;re working on the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk> .
You &apos;ve seen this year with the flu , we always <unk> a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s about <unk> .
I think that you can change building <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
This is how the future could start to look <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> the evolution with <unk> , <unk> , and finally <unk> .
We &apos;re at so <unk> people .
Our purpose is to do in a way of living in a long time to try to <unk> . Thank you very much .
First of all , I &apos;m going to show you , the <unk> , some <unk> , the new technology we &apos;ve taken to a <unk> almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
It &apos;s a environment where you can <unk> is at local level that you can <unk> with a huge amount of data <unk> .
We &apos;re seeing here <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> images as we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much the amount of information we see , how big it is the <unk> of data or the images .
Most of the <unk> are common <unk> , but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in any time . It &apos;s also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a book , all of data .
This is <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And so , you know , it &apos;s not about images , we can do something like that , to make a really , to make it really is a real <unk> <unk> , not a picture .
It could be a little <unk> to read a <unk> book .
I won &apos;t tell you .
This is an <unk> example . This is a <unk> number of The <unk> .
Every big image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the <unk> and the beautiful experience of reading the real experience of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> <unk> .
We also did something with the corner of the <unk> of the <unk> .
We &apos;ve created a <unk> <unk> much <unk> than the one you use in a normal <unk> , and we &apos;ve <unk> you in the <unk> <unk> .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see it here .
Or even models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
We think this <unk> will be <unk> to <unk> and other <unk> <unk> , not to be <unk> .
Of course , <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this . I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say that we have <unk> <unk> to give in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. <unk> over a NASA <unk> .
So now I &apos;m going to talk about something else .
This is actually live on the Web ; you can <unk> to see .
This is a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> <unk> . A very interesting <unk> <unk> , a student of the <unk> <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s live on the Web , <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this type of <unk> , where we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of experience <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of images here actually has a meaning .
The <unk> <unk> of the computer <unk> have <unk> these images together , so that we <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk> . So here of you see the elements of a <unk> <unk> or <unk> , and these things have been all <unk> <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of <unk> data , and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that we &apos;ve done for the first time , we &apos;re going to show you what &apos;s really is the key behind this technology , the technology is really the key technology behind this technology , <unk> .
We had to <unk> <unk> and so on .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> and <unk> images of types of <unk> and <unk> images of types in <unk> , other <unk> and so on . <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> an image of <unk> .
So they &apos;re all <unk> images and have been all <unk> <unk> in this way .
And you can <unk> this <unk> .
You know , I never would never thought to work for <unk> .
It &apos;s very <unk> <unk> this type of <unk> here .
I think you &apos;ll see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of <unk> : from the cell phones to the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can do that , I <unk> to look for those <unk> .
A lot of <unk> , etc .
<unk> there is a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from <unk> to the physics of this environment .
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now <unk> data from the entire memory of how <unk> the earth <unk> , from the entire <unk> of how <unk> the earth , from the <unk> view and <unk> all of those data together .
All those pictures become <unk> together , the greater than the <unk> parts .
You have a model of the earth that you <unk> .
Think about this as the <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> on Earth .
It &apos;s something that we &apos;re going to <unk> hands that people will <unk> it , and the <unk> that we &apos;re going to <unk> with the use .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people .
If someone gets the idea of <unk> all of <unk> <unk> , the name of the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> all of those data , and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> to <unk> in that space , in that <unk> , using the pictures of everyone else , and have an experience of social kind of <unk> and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all of this is <unk> <unk> <unk> of any interesting interesting <unk> of the land , <unk> not only <unk> <unk> and <unk> images .
<unk> : <unk> .
Chris Anderson : I understand that ? What &apos;s the software will <unk> us to do is that at some point in the next years , all the photographs that we &apos;re going to be <unk> with anybody in the world , are <unk> <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is it <unk> to find .
It &apos;s <unk> by <unk> , if you want , you know , in images .
And he &apos;s doing it in the <unk> of the images .
And the thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> information that many of these <unk> images .
As you do a <unk> research on the web , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the page , you know , the text on the images .
Now , what happens if that picture <unk> all of your picture ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s really enormous . It &apos;s a <unk> effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it &apos;s really amazing . <unk> .
<unk> : I &apos;m going to <unk> you very much .
One of the major <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is the <unk> to live in the <unk> , <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of plants .
<unk> to think that <unk> <unk> still beyond the <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> still <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of the world we live in there is no <unk> , but it &apos;s just a model , reality , but it &apos;s just a <unk> of reality .
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , well , <unk> , many <unk> .
And of course , all the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
All <unk> . <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> to <unk> .
We have to <unk> the death <unk> , so we don &apos;t know if we <unk> and <unk> --
We all have an art .
What <unk> is the <unk> of the song , the <unk> of any culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that it &apos;s the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> .
He was the <unk> of my journey in the <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , the mother &apos;s <unk> .
All of these <unk> <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of <unk> moving around the world .
And , if you <unk> a second , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of the world &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and <unk> the planet , and it &apos;s important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> known as <unk> .
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the total <unk> of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> in being from being the human imagination .
<unk> is the <unk> <unk> of humanity .
It &apos;s the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as <unk> species .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or is about the <unk> of <unk> because it &apos;s <unk> , or -- in the most <unk> -- in the field of diversity , and you don &apos;t even <unk> <unk> at the <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> -- the <unk> of <unk> .
The <unk> of all of that is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
One language is not just <unk> by a <unk> or a series of rules .
One is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle with the <unk> that the <unk> of any culture is coming in the world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> .
And the <unk> <unk> , while we &apos;re in here at least <unk> , at least half not <unk> in the <unk> of children .
They &apos;re not <unk> to children , which means not <unk> something , which is <unk> not <unk> something , which is already death .
What is most <unk> of the <unk> of being <unk> by the <unk> , of the last to talk about a language , of not <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of someone in the world every two weeks of the world every two weeks -- every two weeks a <unk> <unk> and <unk> it <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
And I know some of you will say , &quot; Don &apos;t that better ?
The world would not be a better place if we all the same language ? &quot; <unk> , we all talk about it . &quot;
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> of a <unk> thing that means that we can &apos;t speak of its own language .
Today I &apos;d like to make you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we &apos;re <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say , &quot; different ways of <unk> , &quot; I mean different ways of <unk> .
So , for example , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> that it &apos;s not able to <unk> the blue color from green because the time <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the time of the forest , which we <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> , <unk> , you have to <unk> a person talking about a <unk> language .
All of this has <unk> in the past <unk> , but the <unk> is that in these <unk> <unk> where you talk about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> nobody <unk> .
You <unk> to listen and then <unk> to talk .
I &apos;m going to talk about one of the most interesting <unk> with , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , an amazing <unk> that has had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
They did <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> forest <unk> never saw anything <unk> .
They <unk> the <unk> from the land , they <unk> the <unk> of a form or a <unk> and , not <unk> anything , they <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
But <unk> not only <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> to them .
<unk> percent <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We &apos;re <unk> at eight <unk> and found two cases of death <unk> and when we &apos;ve been <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was so <unk> he died , and then they <unk> it the same . And then they <unk> it . And then they <unk> it . And then they <unk> it . And then they <unk> it . <unk> <unk> , they had a <unk> <unk> of the forest .
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species .
In the early &apos; <unk> , I was <unk> a really interesting <unk> when my <unk> <unk> <unk> , if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> between the <unk> society and <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> to make the <unk> .
To make sense of <unk> , I should have to understand culture <unk> and <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> view of the world .
Very interesting .
If you &apos;re <unk> the <unk> of the world &apos;s great <unk> of the world , what about ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent has always <unk> out , thinking that <unk> Africa has no <unk> <unk> . And instead of the <unk> is nothing else <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is the <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> of life and death .
So <unk> do <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> live in a short time that for a short time , <unk> becomes the <unk> .
For this <unk> <unk> to say , &quot; <unk> <unk> , you go to <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> God . &quot;
And what you &apos;re <unk> , is the spirit that you have , how do you , you can make you <unk> of evil ?
So you &apos;re <unk> to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> in the state of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> with which I lived the most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> civilization that once <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> never <unk> .
In <unk> , I &apos;ve been <unk> by a <unk> , but their education is <unk> extraordinary .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> by <unk> , or four years , and they live in a world that &apos;s made of <unk> and <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> years of <unk> <unk> by the nine months of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of the mother , now are <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
For this time , they &apos;re <unk> to the values of their society , <unk> that <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or for better , the <unk> <unk> .
In the <unk> of this incredible <unk> , they <unk> out and for the first time in their life , at <unk> age . And in that moment of <unk> , <unk> . And in that moment of <unk> <unk> , everything that <unk> <unk> <unk> , everything they learned in the theory is <unk> <unk> , everything that they &apos;ve learned in the theory . The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . And it <unk> does a step back and says .
&quot; <unk> ? <unk> , how I said . &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> . Now it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
They call the major <unk> and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re the <unk> of the world .
This is <unk> important .
When we think about <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and the old story of the <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> in his <unk> or <unk> <unk> and we say that these <unk> are <unk> <unk> to the Earth than we are .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> <unk> <unk> .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , but because of time and <unk> and <unk> , have created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> . <unk> on a <unk> : the concept that the Earth can only live because it &apos;s <unk> by human <unk> .
What does it mean ?
You should say that a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> its <unk> will be a human <unk> , and will have a <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> a <unk> is a human <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> a mountain is <unk> to be <unk> .
<unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
That made me a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> .
If we started <unk> that these <unk> can create different reality , we could actually start to understand some of them <unk> <unk> . <unk> this <unk> .
I &apos;ve <unk> this picture at <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What makes fascinating <unk> is not the potential of the <unk> of the <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> by two elements .
On one hand , this <unk> <unk> that <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> you have a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit of <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> with the <unk> of a family <unk> <unk> said <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you &apos;ve ever seen <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . It &apos;s not a <unk> of reality .
<unk> often with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk> , with his <unk> <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> to my <unk> you can &apos;t <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you &apos;re not <unk> because if you can &apos;t tell anybody to be <unk> . <unk> , you can &apos;t be <unk> because they &apos;re <unk> by a <unk> that &apos;s <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> .
It &apos;s possible to <unk> <unk> if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Now , it &apos;s the <unk> : the <unk> that you have in this <unk> of <unk> , the same kind of <unk> to <unk> the <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> species , how do these <unk> <unk> <unk> , they make two <unk> not <unk> , but that if they <unk> in this way , they create <unk> <unk> . But that if they do this way , they create <unk> <unk> .
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you <unk> to the <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> us . &quot;
What does it mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in the forest , and our eyes in the forest itself species .
If you <unk> it as <unk> their <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , you don &apos;t know everything ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take the <unk> <unk> in a night of the moon and <unk> with a different <unk> .
And so , you don &apos;t get <unk> , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , &#91; <unk> &#93; the problem is that the <unk> of us who have to heart <unk> <unk> them , but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of the history of our history , and <unk> beyond .
In fact , the <unk> century , not <unk> <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk> , but rather like the <unk> <unk> , but rather like the <unk> was where we have <unk> and <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the planet is not the change .
All the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities of life .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> didn &apos;t have <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> <unk> and <unk> like this <unk> didn &apos;t have <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It &apos;s the power .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And if you look at the world , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , if you look at the world .
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> and <unk> out of the existence of <unk> <unk> that go beyond their <unk> <unk> .
<unk> you <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> , a <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> in the forest until a generation ago , and now <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> on the <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that seems to be <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> to <unk> <unk> with the forest <unk> .
Or in the case of <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> .
If we <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I &apos;m doing many research , you &apos;ll see the <unk> <unk> of politics .
As <unk> <unk> , <unk> physics , <unk> physics , it &apos;s <unk> to <unk> , but the <unk> of the <unk> of life of a <unk> , not only is <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it &apos;s part of the development of the development of the development of the development is <unk> .
And you can &apos;t understand the <unk> <unk> until you go from the beginning .
I <unk> miles from <unk> miles from <unk> in China through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> <unk> <unk> . I got it to understand what &apos;s behind the <unk> that we &apos;re going to talk .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> at the <unk> <unk> .
That means that it &apos;s been <unk> to the <unk> of Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and her <unk> , and her <unk> was <unk> .
It was <unk> to <unk> at the age of two years old <unk> under his <unk> because he couldn &apos;t live without him .
The <unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> .
One day he <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> , and he was <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for seven years .
The pain of the <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> , all <unk> to a choice .
How many of the world <unk> or <unk> of <unk> , or we want to <unk> the world of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died said that his greatest fear was , that , in our <unk> to the world &apos;s <unk> , not only <unk> the entire <unk> of the human imagination to a <unk> <unk> of thought , but one day we <unk> us from a <unk> <unk> that there was other possibilities .
And it &apos;s <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , who <unk> us to <unk> agriculture , who <unk> us to the <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has to <unk> 300 years .
That <unk> story I didn &apos;t <unk> to me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to come .
When you <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all <unk> the chance of being what we are : a <unk> species , that has to <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are big moments of <unk> moments .
I took this picture on the <unk> of the island of <unk> , when I went to <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> me , and this man , <unk> me the wonderful story of her <unk> .
The <unk> government was not <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> for our <unk> , we &apos;ve <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> .
The family , <unk> for his life , <unk> all the <unk> away all the <unk> , and all of her <unk> .
You know , you know , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> were made of <unk> fish .
The <unk> of this man didn &apos;t <unk> <unk> from night or <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> away , you know , you <unk> the <unk> skin and <unk> in your hand . When I did <unk> , he <unk> it by it , he <unk> it by <unk> it by <unk> a <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> created a <unk> , he <unk> another dog , and he <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
What do you talk about <unk> with nothing ? <unk> . And this , in different ways , <unk> <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of an area larger than the California and <unk> <unk> together .
It &apos;s their new <unk> . It &apos;s called <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s all the <unk> resources .
So , you know , a <unk> of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , to end , I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> at least at least <unk> , <unk> , <unk> that they &apos;re not at all <unk> .
For somebody &apos;s home .
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the time . And for us all , the dreams of our children , become part of the <unk> <unk> of hope .
To end , we &apos;re <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> that the <unk> never <unk> .
I think the <unk> --
&#91; <unk> &#93; are not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our site is <unk> million <unk> . &#93;
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our audience to places to <unk> our public in places to <unk> <unk> from how much seen and , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> a time <unk> the central <unk> : the world &apos;s <unk> in the <unk> , and we have to find a <unk> world in a <unk> world . And <unk> , we have to find a <unk> world in a <unk> and <unk> world .
where the <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I &apos;ve written about this book that I hope <unk> other <unk> , and <unk> <unk> some <unk> <unk> , in case they didn &apos;t <unk> them .
I &apos;d like to start with what I call &quot; the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> : &quot; If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens . &quot; The way to do it is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
The reason is , on one side , in the fact that the <unk> is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> for human beings .
<unk> the other is that if we &apos;re <unk> , each of us can act for the <unk> to do everything that we <unk> our <unk> , without any <unk> that we &apos;re going to <unk> our <unk> , <unk> in our name .
The way to <unk> the freedom is <unk> .
The more choices people have , more <unk> , and more of them is the <unk> , the more of them is their <unk> .
This , <unk> , it &apos;s so <unk> <unk> in the society that nobody <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it &apos;s also <unk> <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I <unk> a simple <unk> on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> that nobody is already <unk> in your <unk> <unk> , that nobody &apos;s already <unk> .
This is what the <unk> is what the <unk> .
Then you go to the <unk> store for a <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there &apos;s a big number of <unk> <unk> .
We can do six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one only one store .
<unk> <unk> there is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a baby , you could get all the services <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , you didn &apos;t <unk> it .
A <unk> of that , in the other , was that the phone never <unk> .
These days went .
We have now a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , especially in <unk> .
Here &apos;s <unk> cell phones .
My <unk> is the one in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
If you haven &apos;t seen it still in the <unk> store , you &apos;re very soon <unk> .
And what happens to the end is that people come in the <unk> and does this question . And you know what the answer is ? The answer is &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t make things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> : <unk> &apos;t happens in the United States you <unk> from the <unk> and the <unk> you <unk> what you have to do .
Instead , <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> says , &quot; OK , we can do . &quot; <unk> , we can do it , or <unk> , &quot; A <unk> , &quot; <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> <unk> . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You say , &quot; <unk> , what do you do ? &quot;
And the <unk> says , &quot; A <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> these <unk> and <unk> these <unk> . &quot;
What do you want to do ?
And you say , &quot; <unk> if you were me , what would you say ? &quot;
And the <unk> , &quot; But I &apos;m not <unk> . &quot;
The result we call &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot;
But actually , it &apos;s not that one <unk> the weight and the responsibility for someone who knows something , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and so that doesn &apos;t know -- and it &apos;s not in the <unk> <unk> to make decisions , the patient .
There &apos;s a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me and you , that if you think it doesn &apos;t make any sense , because you can &apos;t <unk> .
But if we can &apos;t <unk> , why do we <unk> them ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> , we call the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> to this <unk> as our <unk> is a question of choice , how you see in this <unk> . &quot; We don &apos;t want to <unk> kids . You don &apos;t want to <unk> . &quot; We don &apos;t want to <unk> . &quot; We have to <unk> it . &quot; We have to <unk> it . &quot;
And we can <unk> how many times we have .
That means that every <unk> , at <unk> , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
<unk> to the family and <unk> , a time the common perspective , <unk> almost for anybody , was that you would <unk> the most soon , and you <unk> to <unk> them to be the <unk> of it as possible .
The only one real choice was with who , not when , and even what to do after .
<unk> , it &apos;s really to play .
We &apos;re going to <unk> students very smart , and <unk> them , 20 percent less than a time .
And they &apos;re not because they &apos;re not <unk> , because they &apos;re not <unk> .
But why am I <unk> , I &apos;m <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> or not ? <unk> it . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> later ? I got to think before or a career ? &quot;
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even though that <unk> didn &apos;t <unk> the <unk> <unk> that <unk> and <unk> not to do a beautiful <unk> to my <unk> .
And they have to do that . They have to do that .
Now , the work : we &apos;re <unk> , like <unk> <unk> , because the technology <unk> us to work every minute , from the <unk> of the planet , <unk> that the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> , and I &apos;m not going to anybody who , where the <unk> works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What does that <unk> to choice ? It &apos;s amazing freedom we have to decide , <unk> , <unk> at any time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to our son to <unk> , with the mobile phone in a <unk> , the <unk> in the other way , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , on the <unk> .
And even though they &apos;re all <unk> , every minute we see our son <unk> , we also <unk> the <unk> , we &apos;re also <unk> , &quot; <unk> to this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to <unk> this <unk> ? I got to <unk> this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , this <unk> experience of your <unk> very different child than that would have been in other conditions .
So , from any part of the things , small and big , and <unk> and <unk> of life , life is a matter of choices .
And once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but not everything was a <unk> of choice .
The world today &apos;s <unk> to this : <unk> is , &quot; Is it a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? &quot;
The answer is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the <unk> .
<unk> this choice <unk> two effects <unk> people .
The first one , <unk> , is <unk> instead of <unk> .
With many <unk> <unk> between , and <unk> , it &apos;s very difficult to do it .
I &apos;ll give you an example . <unk> : a study <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of my <unk> has had access to <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , with about a million <unk> <unk> in different <unk> <unk> .
And what she discovered is that for all 10 solutions are <unk> <unk> in more , the <unk> <unk> <unk> two percent .
In 50 <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s 10 percent <unk> <unk> than when they &apos;re available to it .
Because with 50 <unk> <unk> between <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> to decide , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And in <unk> , and still <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course <unk> never <unk> .
<unk> that doesn &apos;t mean it just these <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don &apos;t have enough money , it &apos;s not enough money , it &apos;s so <unk> that you can <unk> the <unk> <unk> of work .
They &apos;re not <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> to <unk> <unk> for year from the <unk> of work , which would be <unk> to <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices .
And I think it &apos;s going to <unk> the world like this .
&quot; And to end , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
You know , you really want to make the right decision , if it &apos;s for the <unk> , isn &apos;t it ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and you &apos;re <unk> the wrong <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second effect is that even though we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice , at the end of the result of how we <unk> <unk> with less <unk> from the result of how we <unk> with less <unk> .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of <unk> between , if you <unk> one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s <unk> to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> the choice , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the decision , and the <unk> <unk> from the decision ,
even when it was a <unk> decision .
More choices there are , it &apos;s more <unk> than any <unk> that is <unk> of choice .
<unk> , there &apos;s what <unk> call .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well <unk> as <unk> as the value we give things from what we &apos;re <unk> .
<unk> , when there are many <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and be less <unk> than the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m not in New York .
But that &apos;s probably <unk> .
There &apos;s this <unk> to the <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It &apos;s all for them .
We didn &apos;t know . But what he thinks he thinks , &quot; Well , <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; All of my <unk> are <unk> . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> right in front of home . &quot;
And it <unk> two weeks <unk> from the idea that &apos;s <unk> -- every day -- the possibility of <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the more of the <unk> that we have <unk> , the most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> us <unk> against how <unk> .
Here &apos;s another example .
This <unk> tells us many things .
We live the moment , and maybe it &apos;s about to live .
But the most important point is that anything you <unk> , you &apos;re not to do other .
The things that don &apos;t <unk> have many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new <unk> .
It &apos;s almost always <unk> <unk> .
Once they were just one kind of the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and they were <unk> , only after they <unk> a lot of times , <unk> to do well .
So , I went to <unk> a couple of new when <unk> <unk> , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> said , &quot; Do you want to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
Do you want them with <unk> or with <unk> ? &quot; <unk> &quot;
&quot; Do you want to <unk> it ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> them wants to <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> -- &quot; <unk> to <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a little bit of a <unk> , and I was <unk> , &quot; I want the guy , &quot; I didn &apos;t know what it was , so for an hour , I &apos;m <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then <unk> out of the <unk> , with the best couple of <unk> I &apos;ve ever had .
It was the <unk> . With all that choice I had <unk> the best .
But I &apos;m <unk> worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to <unk> .
The reason I was most of the <unk> is that I was <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn &apos;t <unk> anything <unk> when I was just one guy , but when I was just <unk> 100 , <unk> , at least one guy had to be perfect .
And I &apos;d <unk> was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
After I <unk> the <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in life of people don &apos;t <unk> <unk> that these have <unk> <unk> that these have <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And this is less <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of the <unk> <unk> .
Because if I <unk> , I &apos;m not talking about what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth will <unk> to this .
&quot; You were better when you &apos;re worse , &quot; The reason he was better when he was worse was <unk> , he was <unk> possible <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world we live in -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things to the <unk> <unk> .
You &apos;ve never <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; Yes , you want it . &quot;
I mean -- little <unk> moment -- that I &apos;m really <unk> and my wife is very <unk> .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t <unk> .
But <unk> isn &apos;t always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> . When you have a <unk> of <unk> when there &apos;s only that kind of <unk> is that when you &apos;re not <unk> , and you will tell you , &quot; Why ? &quot;
Who is <unk> ? &quot; <unk> , the answer is <unk> .
The world is <unk> . What do I could do that ?
When there are hundreds of <unk> , and you get a <unk> , and you &apos;ll see who &apos;s the <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , it clear that the <unk> you are .
We could have done better .
With hundreds of <unk> <unk> , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even if the <unk> is <unk> , they <unk> <unk> and they give their own .
In the last years , the <unk> is <unk> in the world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only one , but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is just that people have <unk> experiences because the <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation they think that <unk> is their <unk> .
So the final result is that in general , we &apos;re better , <unk> , but we &apos;re even worse .
Let me <unk> you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all do for good and it &apos;s completely <unk> . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no <unk> that a little bit better than not <unk> at all , but it doesn &apos;t <unk> that much choice , but it doesn &apos;t <unk> that much better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a <unk> value , <unk> . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve <unk> from a piece of <unk> the level that the choices we have to <unk> our life .
Now , from the <unk> perspective , I &apos;ve almost finished -- from the <unk> point of view , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What allows all this choice in <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not <unk> .
The problem is they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I &apos;m talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> society .
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> yesterday about how <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> are <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> of money .
I mean , these choices , <unk> and <unk> , not that they are just <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
They do have worse to be .
If you some of what in our <unk> society <unk> was <unk> in those where people have too much chance , it would not only be their lives to <unk> , but our <unk> .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of the income does well , not only to the poor -- not only because of this choice in <unk> us .
And to <unk> , &quot; <unk> , you can become everything you want , &quot;
<unk> , people of culture , <unk> , &quot; What &apos;s going to <unk> that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s <unk> you can &apos;t make anything in a glass <unk> . &quot;
&quot; A <unk> imagination , a <unk> view of the world --
and I <unk> it like this , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I realized that fish know that fish know the <unk> knows .
Because the reality of fact is that if you <unk> the <unk> , in a way that you can &apos;t <unk> the <unk> <unk> . You <unk> it .
If you <unk> the <unk> in the way that you can <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They all need a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
