<unk> year , I showed these <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for nearly three million years , had the <unk> <unk> of the United States , it was <unk> 40 percent .
It <unk> this <unk> of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is , in a way , the heart <unk> of climate system .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> and <unk> of the summer .
The next <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You see , it <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That &apos;s the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , of five years or more , it &apos;s like the blood , that &apos;s like the body .
It &apos;s been like this , in 25 years .
This is a problem because the <unk> is <unk> <unk> around the <unk> ocean , where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> , are <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , that amount of <unk> , that amount of <unk> , <unk> this <unk> <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> in <unk> the <unk> is already <unk> by the water .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> of <unk> was <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> last <unk> team .
<unk> : <unk> ! Al <unk> : She &apos;s good . The question is if we <unk> it .
One is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the north .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> never <unk> like that .
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you want to know how it <unk> <unk> the sea level to <unk> on <unk> , here is where the sea is <unk> .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
On the other hand on the planet : <unk> , the biggest ice <unk> of the planet .
<unk> month , scientists have <unk> that the ice <unk> is in <unk> , and that the Western <unk> , that <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> at six feet of <unk> , as in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the third largest <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , that few years ago , they were <unk> .
40 percent of the world population <unk> half of <unk> water from that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : this <unk> is the source of <unk> water of this city .
The <unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same thing happens to <unk> water .
In California , <unk> <unk> is <unk> of 40 percent .
The <unk> <unk> are in crisis .
<unk> , as you read , you &apos;re <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the world leads to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and without <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years , than <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> .
If you look at it in the <unk> context , you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve <unk> million <unk> of <unk> every day . 25 million <unk> in the oceans , 25 million <unk> in the oceans .
Look at <unk> the area of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , to <unk> , and on both the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the oceans .
The greater cause of global warming , together to <unk> , which is 20 percent of them , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the <unk> of the <unk> , with China .
And they <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> .
But we &apos;re starting to a <unk> of direction .
These are the projects over the last few years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
So , there &apos;s a political <unk> in our country .
The <unk> of <unk> and oil have <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
So , I <unk> , I <unk> something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it on the <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> in America .
It &apos;s been <unk> around <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> of one of the <unk> of <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> â™« <unk> <unk> is a <unk> and happy .
It &apos;s been here in America , and it &apos;s <unk> our economy .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> .
It &apos;s at good price , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
Al <unk> : From here , you know , from here , a lot of <unk> <unk> .
The biggest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al <unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , one part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> , we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business .
So , for our <unk> is <unk> a lot of money in a <unk> <unk> to public and <unk> the truth to <unk> .
In fact , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it &apos;s <unk> -- it &apos;s got a good <unk> .
So , we don &apos;t have to <unk> the climate change .
We can do it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you &apos;ve heard about that a lot .
So we &apos;re going to <unk> a <unk> structure in a <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> ! The machines are a little <unk> , but this is the sound of the <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> is between the global <unk> of <unk> , but the <unk> technology of <unk> that you see is changing everything .
So , let &apos;s look at a <unk> technology .
Al <unk> : <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security .
<unk> : <unk> , America is in the crisis ; the economy , the national security crisis .
The <unk> that all the <unk> of : our <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and oil .
Now , but there &apos;s a new one , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan to <unk> America to work , <unk> more <unk> , and help <unk> <unk> , and help <unk> the global <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we can solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
Al <unk> : This is the last .
<unk> : <unk> : This is about <unk> energy .
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , a new network .
<unk> <unk> 2 : <unk> <unk> <unk> for jobs .
<unk> : <unk> America . It &apos;s time to be <unk> .
Al <unk> : A <unk> <unk> <unk> says , &quot; If you want to go , go for yourself .
If you want to go far , you go , go together . &quot;
We have to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED , I made a <unk> on the <unk> .
And we &apos;re trying to <unk> on how the car works .
So , I went . And for the ones that <unk> the other time , there were the biggest scientific <unk> ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were present less than a <unk> of a second from the beginning of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second .
This is just <unk> .
This is the <unk> machine .
They <unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk> .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> feet and it &apos;s a <unk> feet .
This is a <unk> picture in building so you can see the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of the last year , we <unk> the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> of particles that had done all the <unk> , <unk> in <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles in the <unk> .
In other words , when you <unk> that image , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> machine , which is a great <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if that was that <unk> us more or this , when somebody <unk> on Google , and they <unk> that the <unk> page was this .
That means that we had a <unk> impact on the scientific .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to be <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> of <unk> .
Now , the <unk> of you <unk> the <unk> and <unk> , &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot;
And they can do that because when they &apos;re very <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees , at least <unk> to the space of the stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> between the <unk> <unk> in <unk> , there was a <unk> of <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and <unk> <unk> of about 30 <unk> .
They have about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We have <unk> and <unk> .
Now they &apos;re <unk> now everybody in their <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> is new <unk> .
We <unk> it , and we <unk> that data to <unk> or <unk> , and on that way our <unk> <unk> to find out what are the <unk> that we <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering of <unk> engineering of <unk> engineering and engineering . It &apos;s easy to <unk> .
I think that it &apos;s so hard , the fact , that it &apos;s so hard , I think it &apos;s the value of things like <unk> .
I want to <unk> with the words of a <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in <unk> of the <unk> of his <unk> , his <unk> was <unk> , and <unk> Michael <unk> was , &quot; &quot; <unk> is not <unk> for the progress of the human mind , that our <unk> are <unk> , that there are no <unk> in nature , and that our <unk> are <unk> , and that there are no new <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to <unk> you to <unk> when , as a children , <unk> with <unk> .
As we <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , actually to think and <unk> , actually <unk> , to think and solve <unk> problems .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way most of the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects , with my <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started to <unk> : &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having a <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> that &apos;s moving on a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> with both hands ,
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that he was trying to explore the answer , building the <unk> .
In a <unk> , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as big as a <unk> .
In a <unk> , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as big as a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , they can <unk> with their own movement and feel their movement and have a screen and a <unk> <unk> .
But <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> it .
The <unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> the digital information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement , of the other , and as they get more <unk> , <unk> of their movement , of their own <unk> , how we <unk> them , we can explore new <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Let &apos;s start with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show the video of the video : if you <unk> it in one direction , the <unk> video , the <unk> video .
These <unk> are <unk> of other people .
If you <unk> them , they <unk> what they are doing around them .
If they &apos;re <unk> , and they can <unk> it up a little bit .
If they &apos;re <unk> , and they can <unk> it up a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We realized that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> was the <unk> to use common data on data , for example , &quot; a color like if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> of <unk> and I can <unk> for <unk> of the color in that central , where they <unk> .
and I can <unk> for <unk> of the color in that central , where they <unk> .
We can <unk> it a little bit , we can <unk> a little bit .
There &apos;s also <unk> possibilities of <unk> , like <unk> , the mathematics and <unk> , where the mathematics and games where people can try things quickly , and <unk> the results are immediately .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of <unk> that I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a game here that &apos;s in half between <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> , a letter <unk> on every <unk> , <unk> , at every <unk> , at every <unk> , a letter <unk> on every <unk> , and as he <unk> <unk> on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try to do .
Thank you .
Here are <unk> children in <unk> <unk> <unk> , I did so that I <unk> them and <unk> a video .
They &apos;re very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things like this is that you have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just wanted to say , &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; I &apos;ll
Here &apos;s other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , on the right there .
It actually wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
You could build a tool for the <unk> . He &apos;s <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now it brought a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : Yes !
So , we <unk> <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
-- <unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide how to make it <unk> .
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide how to make it <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example that I have time to show you is a tool that I did , and recently , to <unk> and <unk> music .
It &apos;s a <unk> , that &apos;s a <unk> , to <unk> and <unk> music .
The <unk> here is <unk> <unk> as base , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of these has four different <unk> , and you can choose which to use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of your <unk> .
And you just <unk> a <unk> sound and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually <unk> that you can control from me , like <unk> and <unk> .
They <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are the <unk> effects as time and <unk> , that <unk> to the whole sequence .
It &apos;s how it works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; sequence , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , on the other basis .
Now , we &apos;re going to <unk> a <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : Now , <unk> <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> : And now I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> , so I can control the effect from alive .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the whole sequence of time on one side or another .
<unk> : <unk> : And now we <unk> the <unk> down to <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the sequence of flight .
So I don &apos;t have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> it , <unk> <unk> or more <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the whole sequence of <unk> on the left the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain works and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to <unk> is that it &apos;s <unk> this new generation of objects to <unk> media , which <unk> information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and my <unk> of life .
And it doesn &apos;t look like me that .
But , said that , something particular happened was <unk> in my life and career , that led me to <unk> the whole relationship with this job .
The particular thing is that I wrote this book , this <unk> called &quot; <unk> , &quot; which , <unk> , &quot; which , <unk> , &quot; which , <unk> , <unk> from my books , for some reason for <unk> <unk> in the world and <unk> a big <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere we are now , people like I &apos;m <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> .
I &apos;m going to be <unk> and say , &quot; You don &apos;t have any fear of not being <unk> to do better ?
You don &apos;t fear of it , and you can write for the whole life without being able to create a book that would help someone to do ? &quot;
What could you help someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , to that I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I was <unk> to say to people -- I was a <unk> .
We &apos;re going to be <unk> by fear .
And people say , &quot; Don &apos;t you hope that you can &apos;t have happened ?
You don &apos;t fear that the <unk> <unk> you ?
You don &apos;t fear of doing this <unk> for all life without anything that nothing has ever been out and <unk> on a <unk> of dreams with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
So , you know .
The short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I <unk> all of those things .
I &apos;ve always been afraid .
And I also <unk> of many other things that people can &apos;t <unk> .
How <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as it is about it , and it &apos;s what I thought and <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It &apos;s <unk> that anyone who <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you hear to do .
But what &apos;s so particular about the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not ?
How do my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> , and I don &apos;t remember one time in his <unk> <unk> , in his <unk> , in <unk> , in fact , if it were fear ?
It was never -- that <unk> of <unk> John , how did it go ?
You don &apos;t do that , you know ?
<unk> , the engineers like a group of people have certainly not certainly , in <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have enough , we have enough , and not just <unk> but <unk> of all of that , we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk> .
And there &apos;s no other than looking at the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , young and often <unk> for them .
And even the ones that don &apos;t seem to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before they die , in the last <unk> , said , &quot; Every my book has <unk> me a little more <unk> . &quot; A extraordinary <unk> about work of his life .
But we don &apos;t <unk> when we <unk> it , because we &apos;ve heard these things so long , long , we &apos;ve got <unk> and <unk> that creativity and creativity <unk> , that creativity and <unk> are <unk> in a way that art , at the end , at the end , at the end , we will always <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> you to all over here today is : you are agree with this idea ?
You &apos;re good -- because even <unk> by a <unk> <unk> to me not . It &apos;s going to be OK for nothing for this <unk> .
I think it &apos;s <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s also <unk> and I don &apos;t want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better , our <unk> <unk> to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- in my <unk> , would be very <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I &apos;m in my career .
<unk> -- look at -- look , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;ve been about 40 years .
I &apos;ve got about four <unk> of work in me .
And it &apos;s very <unk> that whatever you &apos;re <unk> of now , in the world as the work that <unk> after the world &apos;s <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , because we are all <unk> friends here -- it &apos;s <unk> that my biggest <unk> is to my <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
You know , this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start <unk> to <unk> nine to the nine of the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I would continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it looks like , after many <unk> , that the way to work on is to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to have a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , that I &apos;m <unk> , and my natural <unk> that I &apos;m <unk> , and my natural <unk> on what that <unk> <unk> wrote . And as I was <unk> for all last year , trying to find other society to see if you have a <unk> , to find other society , to see if you have a <unk> , to see other society , to see if we have better ideas and more <unk> than
how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research led me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s because it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> -- people don &apos;t believe that creativity <unk> from men , OK ?
It <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and that <unk> to men in a <unk> and <unk> , for <unk> reasons <unk> and <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
The <unk> were the same idea , but <unk> that species of the spirit without a <unk> body .
which is <unk> , because the <unk> doesn &apos;t really feel that a <unk> was a particularly smart .
I thought a <unk> was this sort of <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> literally in the <unk> of the study of an artist , a little <unk> like the <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> out to <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the <unk> of that .
<unk> <unk> , that &apos;s the distance I &apos;m talking about -- that <unk> <unk> you from your <unk> results from your work .
And everybody <unk> that was so that you were <unk> , right ?
So , the <unk> artists were <unk> by things , like that , for example , isn &apos;t it ?
If your work was <unk> not <unk> <unk> all the <unk> , you would have been <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it wasn &apos;t all <unk> , right ?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
And then the <unk> <unk> and everything <unk> , and we <unk> this great idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe , and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> this big idea ; we put the human <unk> , and we put it all the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the universe , and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
This was the <unk> principle and people were thinking that it was <unk> , and people were thinking that creativity was completely from the <unk> .
And for the first time in history , you start to <unk> this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> , a person with the <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think that it was a big <unk> .
I think that &apos;s going to be a simple person , to think of being a <unk> like a source , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> is a responsibility for too big to give to the human <unk> .
It &apos;s like to ask someone to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> the <unk> and creates all of these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think that &apos;s been this pressure to have <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years .
And , if that &apos;s true , and I think it &apos;s true , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do that <unk> ?
They want to go back to a more <unk> of human relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe it &apos;s not .
Maybe we can &apos;t do it , you know , 500 years of thinking about a <unk> <unk> .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience who are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on their <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , do that <unk> people <unk> <unk> on their projects .
You probably don &apos;t <unk> all this stuff .
But the question I want to <unk> is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t we <unk> this way ?
Because more sense of everything that has ever heard about to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> process .
A process that , as anyone who ever had to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t <unk> <unk> .
And , in fact , it can sometimes look like a completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> , <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , who has now 90 years , but who was a <unk> for the entire life and said that during his <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> , <unk> him , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> .
He said that he was like a <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> to her from the <unk> .
They <unk> it to get , because they <unk> the earth under his feet .
I thought that I had one thing to do , and it was to , words , &quot; <unk> as a <unk> . &quot;
And so he went back home and he came from this <unk> , and he wouldn &apos;t have any other than taking a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> , and he was <unk> and he was <unk> and he was <unk> on the page .
Sometimes you can &apos;t <unk> to be enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> it <unk> the <unk> through and she would <unk> her through her <unk> , looking at how she said , &quot; she &quot; she said , &quot; another <unk> . &quot;
And then there were the time , this piece of the time , the piece of the moments of the moments when the <unk> was <unk> , OK ?
So , he was <unk> at home and he was looking for the paper and <unk> through , and he <unk> a <unk> , and he was <unk> , and then he said , that he was <unk> , he was like , if he <unk> with the other hand and the <unk> .
It <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> in his body and <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk> , but the <unk> , the last word to the first word .
So when I <unk> him -- it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not all my <unk> process -- I &apos;m not a <unk> !
I &apos;m a <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> is ; I <unk> it every day and <unk> and work and <unk> and <unk> and work and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and work and <unk> <unk> .
But even I , in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And you would say that many of you have .
You know , even if the work and the ideas <unk> me <unk> from a certain source , I could not be <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it in a way to do not make the head , but rather , that , what does <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
For me , the best example , the <unk> example that I have <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I <unk> different years ago for a <unk> .
I was talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the artist <unk> <unk> <unk> , trying to control , <unk> , <unk> species of <unk> totally <unk> .
But then <unk> , he <unk> , and one day as he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> it , <unk> it all for him .
It &apos;s going to be fast and <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> , who comes in his head as he does the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , you know , and <unk> , and <unk> , you know , <unk> , but it doesn &apos;t know how to <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
So he starts to hear this kind of old old <unk> , he said , &quot; I &apos;m going to <unk> it , and <unk> <unk> <unk> by this song .
I &apos;m not <unk> enough and I can &apos;t <unk> . &quot;
And instead of going to go to the <unk> , they <unk> .
He <unk> the whole process and made a completely new .
He just <unk> the sky and said , &quot; <unk> , you don &apos;t see that I &apos;m <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; You think it can write a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you know , you &apos;re going to <unk> when I can take care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> another one .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And his process <unk> <unk> after that .
It wasn &apos;t the work , it was still <unk> as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that out of him <unk> , the <unk> that he <unk> him , he <unk> back from where he was , he was <unk> that he had to be , and he <unk> it back where he was , <unk> that he had to be <unk> .
but he <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation with <unk> and this thing <unk> and <unk> , but it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
So how much that story is going to change a little bit , even the way I &apos;m going to <unk> , and I &apos;m <unk> .
This idea , I &apos;m <unk> when I was <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; and <unk> , &quot; and I was in one of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> in which we &apos;re all working in something and we can &apos;t , and we can &apos;t , and we start to think that it &apos;s a book , that &apos;s going to be the book .
Not only <unk> , the book wrote .
And we started to think of <unk> this project .
But then I &apos;m <unk> to <unk> that <unk> to the air and <unk> us .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> at a <unk> <unk> of the room .
And I said <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , what , you know , if this book is not going to be <unk> , my <unk> ? &quot;
Because you see , I &apos;m <unk> everything I have , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want it better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , don &apos;t do it .
I started writing the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I would like to please that it was <unk> that I &apos;m <unk> for that I &apos;m <unk> to do my own part . &quot; Because -- <unk> does in the <unk> of Africa , the North people , for the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every while , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these artists actually <unk> .
And I know what I do , because I know that you have all of , at some point , a <unk> like that .
It was like time , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it wasn &apos;t doing anything different from the usually , like the <unk> <unk> <unk> before , but everything <unk> .
And suddenly it doesn &apos;t <unk> just as a human just .
But it <unk> up from <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , they <unk> it with her name .
<unk> your hands and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> , they <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , they <unk> this <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> by &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; to , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; that you still feel in <unk> or <unk> .
In <unk> , when a artist did something impossible and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it &apos;s <unk> because we need it .
But , the problem comes the next day , for the <unk> , when you go and <unk> and <unk> that are 11 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> God is no longer there .
It &apos;s just a <unk> with a lot of <unk> , and perhaps never <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God , as they were <unk> , and what does so it have to do with the rest of your life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But perhaps it doesn &apos;t have to be so <unk> if you can &apos;t believe , <unk> , <unk> , that the most <unk> <unk> of your being is being being being <unk> by yourself .
But let &apos;s just <unk> you that data in <unk> from a <unk> of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to another <unk> when you &apos;re finished .
And , you know , if we think it in this way , it &apos;s going to change it .
And so I started <unk> , and it &apos;s certainly how I <unk> it for several months during the <unk> <unk> , that was soon , <unk> , <unk> of my <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of my success .
And what I have to do is , when I feel <unk> from that is , I don &apos;t fear .
You don &apos;t just <unk> . You just don &apos;t just <unk> your work .
<unk> <unk> for your <unk> , whatever it can be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> to you <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for one moment through your <unk> , for a moment through your <unk> , &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
You <unk> , you do the same <unk> .
And &quot; <unk> ! &quot; to you .
I think and I think it &apos;s <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; to you , &quot; <unk> , &quot; for you had a human and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know , I &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects , about what it can happen and discovery of new genes .
Now we &apos;re looking at a new process : we &apos;ve started <unk> the biology and now start by the digital code in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We &apos;ve always tried to <unk> big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; is something that many <unk> I think have <unk> to different levels .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> for almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome to be <unk> by the world &apos;s <unk> of the computer biology in the digital world of computer .
Now , do we <unk> : we can <unk> life , or create new life on this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species of the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> a little more little more .
We &apos;re able to <unk> a <unk> of <unk> of <unk> that are here .
But when we take a look at his <unk> map , it &apos;s very simple than our own .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at a time , it &apos;s very <unk> that this can bring a <unk> cell .
So we <unk> that the only way to <unk> this <unk> in a way to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of &quot; <unk> we can <unk> a <unk> ? &quot;
Can the chemistry <unk> to produce these large molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And in case , we can make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> .
The speed with which we are able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the <unk> code , instead , <unk> rather slowly , but it &apos;s <unk> .
And our most <unk> results bring in a <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve been <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before that <unk> the experiments .
But we &apos;ve found that DNA <unk> is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> little <unk> of DNA , of <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> process : the more <unk> is a <unk> process : the more <unk> is there .
So we had to develop a new way to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And that was our first <unk> , <unk> from information digital information of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a little <unk> that bacteria .
We designed the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA of about <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> it in bacteria , bacteria have <unk> to read this <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> particles .
The <unk> particles have been there , and they have <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I talked about recently , with <unk> <unk> <unk> that they have certainly <unk> this model .
They have more than you .
I think this is a situation where the software can really build its own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we could do the biggest things .
You have to build the entire <unk> of <unk> .
They &apos;re more than <unk> <unk> <unk> of code .
So we thought we &apos;re <unk> in <unk> of the <unk> of the virus , so that we can change the <unk> of a cell phone .
<unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> information into a computer , they have to be very <unk> .
When you <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> , the standard <unk> was of a <unk> for a <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve found , we &apos;re going to be <unk> , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to do that .
One part of the process is design <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> <unk> to build smaller <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
You have to <unk> elements here .
You probably have read that <unk> us .
So , we have a <unk> code for four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , about 20 <unk> , and there &apos;s a <unk> order of <unk> to each <unk> .
So we can use the <unk> code for it , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did is we did at the beginning .
Some of them have been <unk> by the fact that it was not <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> <unk> .
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> at 24 <unk> <unk> <unk> at the time to get to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
At any step , we have produced these <unk> in <unk> so that we &apos;re trying to create a very <unk> <unk> as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to <unk> the process .
So , it looks like a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When you start these <unk> <unk> , more than 100 <unk> <unk> , they don &apos;t <unk> directly into the <unk> <unk> .
It comes to the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> biology .
So we have <unk> other <unk> .
We &apos;re going to be another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA .
Here &apos;s an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> like its <unk> is <unk> .
In 12 hours , it &apos;s exactly like it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely .
You have to live under <unk> .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and they <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
Actually , NASA has shown that this happens .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we &apos;ve built these <unk> , just using the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> design of <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This picture wasn &apos;t <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s such a big <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> that we did a little time ago .
They &apos;re more <unk> than <unk> code .
It &apos;s the biggest <unk> of a <unk> structure ever <unk> by man .
It has a <unk> <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> <unk> <unk> , you &apos;d just <unk> pages to <unk> this code .
Now , how do we make it work ?
Of course , a virus is a <unk> game .
It &apos;s a little bit more <unk> when they use of bacteria .
It &apos;s <unk> cells like our <unk> , how our <unk> : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the <unk> process .
In <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> in the cell , but we have <unk> <unk> that we are able to do a <unk> <unk> of a cell in the cell , and we <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> species .
The two different are how men from <unk> .
We &apos;ve <unk> a few <unk> more <unk> in a way to decide what this <unk> to choose what to choose to do .
He then <unk> it with the <unk> so that it <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> went into the cell .
And <unk> <unk> that we didn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to <unk> more .
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution .
We &apos;ve found that <unk> species have <unk> a <unk> <unk> somewhere , or a third <unk> somewhere , we <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So who thinks evolution as a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> didn &apos;t understand much of the biology .
We <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> DNA .
The <unk> that was in the cell , it didn &apos;t <unk> one .
The <unk> <unk> that we <unk> it .
It &apos;s <unk> , and it <unk> the other <unk> as a <unk> material , it <unk> , and we <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk> .
It &apos;s become blue because of the genes that we have <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species <unk> go and <unk> of the whole new species , <unk> on the new software that we &apos;ve <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code that will <unk> exactly what we &apos;ve been <unk> .
Now , this may be <unk> <unk> , but we <unk> the software DNA , we can change things <unk> enough .
Now , I &apos;ve already <unk> that there &apos;s not about <unk> -- but <unk> of progress from three million years from now and a half a thousand evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create new <unk> <unk> <unk> species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> when we think of our <unk> .
We &apos;re going to go for six billion , a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give you an example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> it in <unk> ; it &apos;s going to be four .
We &apos;re <unk> problems now to find food , <unk> water and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , six and a half billion people .
We &apos;re going to be even more <unk> to do that for nine billion .
We &apos;re going to <unk> more than 30 billion <unk> .
That means 100 million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process to <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
In more we have to realize that of the entire CO2 <unk> from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
And I think , because of the <unk> <unk> all over the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that they are the <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> <unk> only a <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from reality and our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , because of these <unk> <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think of these 20 million genes of different genes or <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard <unk> .
We can choose for a possibility of <unk> , chemistry or chemistry or <unk> production , <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software that we &apos;re working on to be able to <unk> and design species to computers .
Well , we don &apos;t know how to be .
We know exactly what their code is .
Now we &apos;re <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> .
You saw that <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We &apos;ve <unk> <unk> and third generation that we &apos;re going to be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a very large <unk> <unk> impact the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> CO2 into matter , and we think we can have the first <unk> of <unk> <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> solar <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> , in our <unk> , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk> .
It &apos;s going to be <unk> feet deep into the <unk> of water .
<unk> <unk> by <unk> by using <unk> hydrogen as energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2 , that can easily be <unk> through <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , in short , we think that we might be able to <unk> what is the basic question of what is . We , we have the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole <unk> industry .
<unk> . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t do it from TED , you can &apos;t do it from TED , you can &apos;t do it from TED , you can &apos;t do it from TED , you can &apos;t do it from TED , you can &apos;t do it .
It &apos;s got a major source of energy .
And we also work to use the same <unk> to use the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk> .
You saw this year with flu , we &apos;re always back a year and with a dollar less , when it comes back to the <unk> right <unk> .
I think that you can change by building <unk> in <unk> .
So that &apos;s how the future might start to look <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> the tree with <unk> , <unk> , and finally cells .
We &apos;re so <unk> to people .
Our purpose is to do in a way of living <unk> to <unk> . Thank you very much .
First of all , I &apos;ll show you , the <unk> possible , some <unk> work , the new technology that we brought to <unk> to a <unk> <unk> , almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
It &apos;s a environment in which you can <unk> is local <unk> that you can <unk> it with a huge amount of data <unk> .
Here we are seeing <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a <unk> quick <unk> , <unk> the images as we want .
And no matter how much it is the amount of information that we see , how much of the data or the images .
Most of the <unk> pictures , but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen . It &apos;s also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a book , which is a book , example of data .
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> is a <unk> .
In fact , it &apos;s the <unk> and not of images , we can do something like that , to make sure it &apos;s a real <unk> of the text , not a picture .
It could be a way that you could read a book <unk> book .
You don &apos;t know .
This is an more <unk> example . It &apos;s a more <unk> example of the <unk> .
Every image big is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the <unk> and the beautiful experience of being a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> kind of <unk> .
We also did something with the corner of this , in particular number of <unk> .
We &apos;ve created a <unk> <unk> much <unk> than the one you use in a normal <unk> , and we <unk> you in the <unk> <unk> .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see it here .
Or even models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And that &apos;s really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
We think that this is actually going to put up to the <unk> and other <unk> , not to be <unk> .
Now , <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say that we have <unk> <unk> to give in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> over a NASA <unk> .
So now we &apos;re going to start something else .
This is actually live on the Web ; you can see it .
It &apos;s a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a very interesting research that computer is really interesting <unk> , a student of the <unk> of Washington , with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s live on the Web , <unk> by <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of experience <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here actually has a meaning .
The <unk> <unk> of computers have <unk> these images together , so that you can <unk> places that <unk> places that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk> . Here in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk> . So here of the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> or <unk> , and these things have all been <unk> <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to spend directly to one of the <unk> data and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that we did for the first time the summer of show you what &apos;s <unk> is really the key to this technology , the <unk> technology , the <unk> technology , <unk> . And it &apos;s not very <unk> <unk> by looking at the <unk> that we have in the website .
We had to <unk> some <unk> <unk> and so forth .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of kinds of <unk> , other <unk> and so forth . <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> a picture that has been discovery <unk> to this model .
So , they have all <unk> images and have all <unk> at the <unk> level in this way .
And you can <unk> this way .
You know , I would never have thought to end up working for <unk> .
It &apos;s very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different kinds of <unk> : that the cell phone to those <unk> <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> number , <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I can , I think , look for those <unk> .
A lot of people are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
<unk> , a number of pictures of -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from <unk> to the physics of this environment .
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now <unk> data from the whole <unk> memory of how we <unk> the earth , from the whole <unk> of how we <unk> the earth , from the whole <unk> of <unk> and <unk> all that data together .
All those pictures become <unk> together , greater than the <unk> of the parts .
You have a <unk> of the earth that <unk> .
Think of it as the <unk> of <unk> &apos;s work on Earth .
It &apos;s something that <unk> in complexity , as people <unk> it , and the <unk> for the <unk> <unk> with use .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> by other people .
If someone else is the idea of <unk> all of these <unk> <unk> the name , my picture of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , you know , you know , the picture of all of the data , and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> to <unk> in the space , using the pictures of everybody else , and have a social <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
Now , a <unk> of all this is , <unk> models that are extremely <unk> of every part of the earth , not just by <unk> <unk> and by <unk> images and <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> .
Chris Anderson : I realized what your software is it going to be doing is that at some point , in the next few years , all the pictures <unk> from anybody in the next few years , all of the pictures <unk> are <unk> ?
<unk> : Yes . What it &apos;s doing is we &apos;re going to find .
It &apos;s creating <unk> , if you want , in images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the <unk> of images .
And it becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> information that a lot of these <unk> images .
As you do a research of images on the Web , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the Web page , it has a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture is <unk> to all your pictures ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and <unk> that &apos;s <unk> that &apos;s really huge . It &apos;s a <unk> effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it &apos;s really incredible . <unk> .
<unk> : You &apos;re very <unk> .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> of the research <unk> is to be able to live between who has no <unk> <unk> , between the wind , <unk> it in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> it in the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
You might think that <unk> will be <unk> even beyond the <unk> <unk> , or that the <unk> of <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , or that in <unk> , the <unk> <unk> still <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , and that the idea that the world in which we live in there is no <unk> sense , but it &apos;s just a model , but it &apos;s a model ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> did , good or bad , a lot of <unk> .
And , of course , everybody <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . Everybody <unk> .
We &apos;re ready to <unk> <unk> .
We need to <unk> the <unk> of death , so we don &apos;t <unk> it and <unk> --
We all have a art .
What <unk> is the particular <unk> of the song , the <unk> of each culture ,
It doesn &apos;t matter that matter the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
He was my <unk> of the journey in <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of the world .
All of these <unk> are <unk> that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you <unk> a second , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of the world create a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and <unk> that <unk> the planet , as the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And you can think of that <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the total <unk> of all the <unk> , the total <unk> of all the <unk> , the ideas , <unk> , <unk> in being by human imagination , by <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> is the wonderful <unk> of humanity .
It &apos;s the <unk> of what we can be , and what we can be as <unk> species .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> much <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , that 50 percent of all species have been or on the <unk> of <unk> , just because it &apos;s <unk> , or -- in the <unk> of <unk> diversity -- and not even <unk> <unk> -- that of the <unk> diversity .
The <unk> of that is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
One language is not just <unk> from a <unk> or a series of rules .
One language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of the <unk> that the <unk> of every culture comes in the material the world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a <unk> , a thought , a <unk> <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we are sitting here at <unk> , at least half is not <unk> in the <unk> of children .
They don &apos;t come to children , the <unk> , which means , unless you do something , which are already .
What is more <unk> than the <unk> of being <unk> by <unk> , of the last to talk about a language , of not having a <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of someone in a few weeks , every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> , and leads with it in the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of a language <unk> .
And I know that some of you will say , &quot; You don &apos;t do that ?
The world would not be a better place if we <unk> all the same language ? &quot; <unk> , we &apos;re all talking about . &quot;
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> of a <unk> thing that means that it can &apos;t talk about your language .
I &apos;d like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we &apos;re <unk> .
A lot of us <unk> that when I say &quot; different ways of <unk> , &quot; I mean different ways of <unk> .
So , for example , this <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> that you can &apos;t <unk> the blue color from green because the <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the time of the forest , which <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; : you have to <unk> a person talking a language .
This has been <unk> in the <unk> past , but the <unk> is that in these <unk> families , where they &apos;re talking about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> nobody practice .
You &apos;re going to hear and then <unk> to talk .
I had a <unk> of the most interesting <unk> that I lived with , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> , five <unk> have <unk> contact .
They &apos;ve done by the top pictures that they <unk> them in <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> forest had never seen anything <unk> .
They <unk> the <unk> <unk> , they <unk> their <unk> to a form or a <unk> , and they didn &apos;t know anything , they <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with the <unk> .
But the <unk> don &apos;t just <unk> the <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> with them .
<unk> percent of the <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We went to eight <unk> and we found two cases of <unk> . And when we first saw to know , they <unk> that one of them was so <unk> that he &apos;s dead , and then they <unk> it .
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> .
<unk> years early &apos; <unk> , it was <unk> a really interesting task when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me , if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> between the society &apos;s <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to use <unk> .
To make sense , I should have a sense of <unk> culture , and that <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a pretty <unk> view of the world .
Very interesting .
If you were to <unk> the <unk> of the world , what would you like ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that <unk> Africa doesn &apos;t have <unk> <unk> . And instead , yes , and the <unk> is not the other than the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes interesting is that <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> of life and death .
So the <unk> do the <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of live in a way that for a short moment , the <unk> becomes the <unk> .
That &apos;s the <unk> <unk> say , &quot; <unk> <unk> go to the <unk> of God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . &quot;
And what you &apos;re <unk> , is the spirit that you &apos;re <unk> , how do you <unk> ?
So , you know , these incredible events : <unk> <unk> in state of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather powerful <unk> of the power of mind on the body when it was <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
We have to <unk> all the <unk> that I &apos;ve lived with the most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that once <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> has never been <unk> by <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> from a <unk> , but their training is extraordinary .
The young <unk> are <unk> away from <unk> to three or four years , and live in a world that &apos;s made <unk> and <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> to <unk> the nine months of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of the mother , now I &apos;m <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
For that time , they &apos;re <unk> to the values of their society , values that they <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or for better say the <unk> <unk> .
So , at the end of this incredible <unk> , they <unk> out and for the first time , they see a <unk> <unk> . And in that moment of <unk> of <unk> <unk> , when the sun <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> , everything that they learned in <unk> , everything they learned in the <unk> . The <unk> does a <unk> back .
&quot; <unk> ? <unk> as I said .
It &apos;s <unk> . Now it &apos;s <unk> . Now it &apos;s <unk> .
They call the big <unk> and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think about the <unk> <unk> and the old history of <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> concept in its <unk> , or perhaps <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are closer to the Earth .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by <unk> .
There &apos;s no <unk> for these things in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or in <unk> <unk> <unk> , but because of time and <unk> , have created a <unk> of the Earth , not <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> -- the concept that the Earth can only live because it &apos;s <unk> by human <unk> .
What does that mean ?
I mean that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> spirit that <unk> its <unk> is going to be <unk> different human relationship with and <unk> relationship with the mountain or that <unk> of a <unk> <unk> , that would be <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
That made me a human being from my friends , <unk> who believe that the <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> that live north of the world , <unk> that live in the world , <unk> that live north .
If you start to <unk> that these <unk> can create different , we start to understand some of their <unk> <unk> . They <unk> this <unk> .
I <unk> this picture at <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
Some of you have heard about <unk> , the most <unk> <unk> , the most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes fascinating is that <unk> is not the potential <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , but its <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> by two elements .
On one hand , this <unk> <unk> that has a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only one has a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit , but it &apos;s <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> of a <unk> of the family <unk> said <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you ever see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> that make a different <unk> of species , <unk> it <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . &#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; &apos;t creates a <unk> of the reality .
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> the man who <unk> the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> to my <unk> , you can &apos;t <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you &apos;re done , you can &apos;t tell anybody to be <unk> . <unk> <unk> , but they can &apos;t be <unk> because they &apos;re <unk> by a <unk> that is , of course , <unk> .
You can only <unk> if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now it &apos;s the beauty : the <unk> that they &apos;re in this <unk> are <unk> of <unk> , the same kind of <unk> <unk> . The <unk> question : in a <unk> <unk> <unk> -- in a <unk> of <unk> species , how do these <unk> <unk> <unk> , they make two <unk> not , but that if they do this <unk> <unk> <unk> , they make a <unk> version that &apos;s more <unk> ?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you <unk> to the <unk> , we <unk> &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , who <unk> <unk> in the forest , and our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If you <unk> it as <unk> their <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , you don &apos;t know everything ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take the <unk> <unk> in a <unk> of the moon and <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
So , you don &apos;t get <unk> , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , &#91; <unk> &#93; the problem is that even the ones that have to heart <unk> , but somehow <unk> to the history of the history of our real world , and <unk> <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , between 300 years , not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk> , but rather like the <unk> of the mass that we were <unk> and we <unk> <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> diversity and <unk> the planet . Now the problem is not the problem .
All the <unk> were <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
The <unk> don &apos;t have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> and <unk> and <unk> like this as the <unk> didn &apos;t have <unk> when they <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It &apos;s the power .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you look at a world , you would think that these are not <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of <unk> , that go beyond their <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that lived in <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> and now <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that looks like <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest <unk> .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are the disease that are <unk> with the <unk> of discovery .
If we <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the <unk> <unk> of politics .
As the <unk> , the <unk> of a <unk> , is <unk> to the <unk> level , but the <unk> of the <unk> of life of a <unk> of a <unk> , not only is <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it &apos;s part of the development of <unk> .
And you can &apos;t understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you go from the beginning .
I <unk> <unk> miles from <unk> in China , through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> <unk> , I got to understand what there is behind the <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re going to talk .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> at the <unk> <unk> .
That means that it &apos;s been <unk> at the time of Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> during the <unk> that led the <unk> in <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and her <unk> was <unk> .
It was brought to <unk> in <unk> at the age of two <unk> under his <unk> because he couldn &apos;t live without a living with him .
The <unk> , which did , was <unk> in the <unk> .
One day she <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for this <unk> , was <unk> to work for seven years .
The pain of <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of <unk> is <unk> .
At the end , it <unk> to a choice .
Do you want to live in the <unk> of <unk> or we want to <unk> the world of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before she died said that her biggest <unk> was that , in our <unk> <unk> vision of the world , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination at a <unk> <unk> of thinking , but one day , we <unk> a <unk> <unk> of thought , but one day we <unk> from a <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it &apos;s <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , who gave us <unk> , that made us <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has a 300 years .
The story is not <unk> me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we could <unk> in the <unk> to come .
When to these <unk> <unk> in the world is asked what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> different <unk> .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all all <unk> the possibilities of being what we are are , a <unk> species , that has to <unk> that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are great moments of <unk> moments .
I <unk> this picture on the north of <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> me , and this man , <unk> me , <unk> the wonderful history of his <unk> .
The government wasn &apos;t always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> to <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> them .
The <unk> of this guy <unk> .
The family , <unk> for his life , <unk> all the <unk> away , and all of his <unk> .
You want to know that <unk> don &apos;t <unk> the cold , you <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> were made of <unk> fish .
The <unk> of this guy didn &apos;t <unk> from the night or the <unk> that <unk> .
It <unk> away , it <unk> up , and it <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did it , she <unk> them by , she <unk> them by it by it , she <unk> them by it by <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> of <unk> and when he <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> had created a <unk> , and he <unk> another dog and he &apos;s <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> you &apos;re talking to <unk> with nothing ? &#91; <unk> &#93; And this , in different ways , &#91; <unk> &#93; is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and of all the <unk> <unk> in the world .
<unk> <unk> government <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a total <unk> area of <unk> <unk> <unk> in California and <unk> <unk> together .
It &apos;s their new <unk> . It &apos;s called <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s all the <unk> resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> at least to the who we &apos;ve been in these areas of the planet , that it doesn &apos;t <unk> at all .
It &apos;s house .
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> at the time . And for us all the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our children , become part of the <unk> <unk> of hope .
<unk> , we are <unk> that the <unk> will never <unk> to anything .
<unk> that the <unk> --
&#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; , but &#93; we don &apos;t think that stories can change the world , and perhaps we are the best <unk> to tell the world &apos;s stories . Every month our website are <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public in places of <unk> <unk> , by which <unk> <unk> from how they saw and , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> world of <unk> in a <unk> world and <unk> .
where <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope <unk> other than you &apos;ve heard and you &apos;ve already had and <unk> some <unk> <unk> , in case you don &apos;t <unk> it .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> of what ?
The <unk> of all the <unk> society <unk> . The <unk> <unk> : &quot; If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens , &quot; The way to do it is to <unk> freedom <unk> . &quot;
The reason is , on one hand , in the fact that freedom is itself a value , is <unk> , useful for human beings .
<unk> else is , in fact , if we are <unk> , every one of us can act for our <unk> , without any one <unk> in the name of our <unk> .
The way to <unk> freedom is <unk> .
More choices , people have more <unk> , and more of their <unk> , the more they are <unk> .
This is , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in society that nobody <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it &apos;s also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
And I &apos;ll show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I <unk> a simple <unk> on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and the 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that nobody of the <unk> already , that nobody of the <unk> already .
That &apos;s what the <unk> is .
And then you go to the <unk> store a <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , radio , radio , <unk> , radio , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there &apos;s a big number of <unk> .
We can do six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one store .
<unk> <unk> there &apos;s a <unk> .
<unk> fields : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the <unk> services , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , you don &apos;t <unk> it .
A <unk> of that , by the way , was that the phone would never be .
These days have gone .
Now we have a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , especially between cell phones .
Here &apos;s mobile phones of the future .
My <unk> is that in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
If you don &apos;t have that you still saw in the <unk> <unk> , you &apos;re very well <unk> .
And what happens at the end is that people come to the <unk> and ask this question . And you know what the answer is ? The answer is &quot; &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t make things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , is <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : no longer happens in the United States that you are <unk> and the <unk> you have to do .
Instead , <unk> by <unk> , and the <unk> says , &quot; OK , we can do A , or <unk> , &quot; A <unk> , &quot; he has these <unk> and these <unk> , &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You were <unk> , what do you do ? &quot;
And the <unk> says , &quot; A <unk> , and these <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; You know , if you were me , what would you say ? &quot;
And the <unk> is , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
And we call it &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; , &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; -- that makes it look like a great thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not a <unk> weight and the responsibility for taking something , <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> , to someone else that don &apos;t know -- and almost certainly is <unk> -- and it &apos;s not in the <unk> <unk> <unk> to make decisions that the patient .
There &apos;s a huge <unk> of products , <unk> to people like me and you , that if you think about it , it doesn &apos;t make sense , because we can &apos;t think it .
But if we can &apos;t <unk> , why do we <unk> them ?
The answer is , they want to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
So , <unk> how we are now our <unk> now is a question of choice , as we see in this <unk> . &quot; We don &apos;t want to <unk> the children . We don &apos;t want to have a <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times they do .
That means that every <unk> , at <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
<unk> to the family and <unk> , a <unk> time perspective , almost for anyone , was that you were <unk> the <unk> soon , and they <unk> to get children as soon as possible .
The only one that was with who , not when , and not , what to do after .
<unk> , it &apos;s really to play .
They &apos;re very smart students , and they <unk> their 20 percent <unk> in a time .
And not because they &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re not <unk> , because they &apos;re <unk> .
but why I &apos;m <unk> , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; <unk> <unk> or not ? &quot;
&quot; Do you want to think before ? I have to think before the children or the career ? &quot;
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even if that <unk> doesn &apos;t <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and do not have a <unk> <unk> to my <unk> .
And they have to do that . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the job : we &apos;re <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because the technology <unk> us to work every minute , from every corner of the planet , <unk> that by <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> , and I don &apos;t say any of , where the <unk> works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What does that mean , that incredible <unk> of choice that we have to decide , <unk> at all moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son to play <unk> , with the <unk> in a <unk> , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , on the <unk> .
And even if they &apos;re all <unk> , every minute that we see our son <unk> the <unk> , we &apos;re also <unk> , &quot; I &apos;ve got to answer this ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer that <unk> ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , &quot; that makes the experience your <unk> , very different than that would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the <unk> , and big things , and large objects , life is a matter of choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but not everything was about choice .
The world today is going to be <unk> to this : The <unk> is , &quot; Is it a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? &quot;
The answer is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> , we all know , so I &apos;ll talk about the <unk> ones .
<unk> this <unk> two <unk> effects of people on people .
The first , <unk> , is that it makes <unk> instead .
With a lot of <unk> between them , it becomes very difficult .
I &apos;ll give you an example of a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> has had access to the <unk> data , the <unk> society , <unk> society , with about a million <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are being <unk> in more , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> two percent .
With 50 percent <unk> , there &apos;s 10 percent in less than when they &apos;re available than when they &apos;re available to five . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> between them , is it &apos;s hard to decide , and the choice is <unk> to decide , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And in <unk> , and still <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , and of course <unk> never comes to .
<unk> that doesn &apos;t mean just that these <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> because they don &apos;t have enough money , they have enough to say that the decision is so <unk> that they <unk> the decision that the decision is so <unk> that they have a <unk> <unk> of work .
They &apos;re not <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> until about five <unk> per year from <unk> of work , that would be very well <unk> .
So , <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices .
And I think that &apos;s going to happen .
&quot; And finally , for <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
You have to make the right decision , if it &apos;s for <unk> , isn &apos;t it ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and you <unk> the wrong <unk> .
So that &apos;s the first effect . The second is that even if we can <unk> <unk> <unk> and make choice , at the end of the <unk> of how we <unk> states with less <unk> from the <unk> of how you were <unk> with less <unk> .
And that for several reasons .
One of them is that with a lot of <unk> between , if you <unk> one and it doesn &apos;t do perfect , you can imagine that you could have a better choice . And what happens is that <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> <unk> of choice , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the decision , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> the decision , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the decision ,
even when it was a decision .
More choices there are , easier to <unk> than any <unk> that is <unk> of <unk> .
And also , there &apos;s what <unk> call them .
Dan <unk> is very well <unk> how we value we <unk> things from what we <unk> .
You know , when there are lots of <unk> possible , it &apos;s easy to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and be less <unk> than the <unk> <unk> that is <unk> .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m <unk> with all of the ones that I &apos;m not in New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably did .
There &apos;s this <unk> to <unk> .
A <unk> place .
<unk> <unk> . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not going to happen . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; All my <unk> are away . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> right in front of your home . &quot;
And it <unk> two weeks <unk> from the idea that it &apos;s <unk> -- every day -- the possibility of <unk> where you want .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the more of the <unk> that we have <unk> , the more the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot .
It &apos;s about living the moment , and perhaps in the <unk> of living .
But the most important thing is that you &apos;re <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> not to do the other .
The things that they don &apos;t <unk> many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new <unk> .
It &apos;s going to be <unk> .
Once the <unk> were just one kind of , and <unk> them from <unk> , they were <unk> , and they were <unk> , only after <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of times , and we <unk> a lot of times , and they <unk> , and they <unk> it to go well .
So , I started <unk> a couple of new when the <unk> were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> said , &quot; Do you want to <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
I want them with <unk> or with <unk> ? &quot; <unk> &quot; or &quot;
&quot; <unk> wants to <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> or <unk> ? &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot;
I was <unk> , and after a while I was able to say , &quot; I want the kind of -- that was the only kind of , &quot; I don &apos;t know what it was , so for a <unk> time , I <unk> , and then <unk> from the <unk> , <unk> , with the best <unk> of <unk> that I had ever had .
It was the <unk> . With all that choice I had <unk> the best .
But I was worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that I had with all that choice , the <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I &apos;d <unk> <unk> . I didn &apos;t <unk> at all , when I was just one like , but when I had a <unk> 100 different , <unk> , at least one guy had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After I <unk> that <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in people &apos;s life , it doesn &apos;t <unk> the <unk> that these have respect to the <unk> of the <unk> .
And that <unk> <unk> , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of <unk> , it makes it .
Because if I <unk> , I &apos;m not talking about what I &apos;m talking about .
The most truth to that .
&quot; He was better when he was worse , &quot; The reason he was doing better than that when he was worse was even worse , you could have <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are at the <unk> of <unk> .
You &apos;ve never <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; Yes , you want to do it . &quot;
I mean -- little <unk> moment -- that I &apos;m really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
But <unk> isn &apos;t always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> when there &apos;s only that kind of <unk> is that when you &apos;re not <unk> , and you &apos;re <unk> , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is <unk> ? &quot; The answer is <unk> .
The world is the <unk> . What can I do ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of <unk> , and you <unk> one , and you will tell , who &apos;s the <unk> , is clear that the <unk> you are .
You could have been doing better .
With hundreds of <unk> , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people are making decisions , even if the result , they <unk> and they give them to them themselves .
In the last few years , the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is really that people have experiences because the standard are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> that they think that <unk> is their <unk> .
So the final result is that in general we &apos;re better , <unk> , but we &apos;re worse .
Let me show you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all do for good and it &apos;s completely <unk> . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no <unk> that a little bit better than that , but it doesn &apos;t <unk> at all , but from that doesn &apos;t <unk> a lot of choice is better than a while .
There &apos;s a <unk> value , <unk> . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve <unk> from a piece of the level in which the choices <unk> our lives .
Now , from a <unk> point of view -- I &apos;ve almost finished -- from a <unk> point of view , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What makes this choice in <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There are a lot of places in the world , and you have <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that they have choice .
The problem is that they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> that I &apos;m talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does <unk> , and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> talked about yesterday about how <unk> and <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> are <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> of money .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , it &apos;s not just <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
They do us be worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows for <unk> to be <unk> in those where people have too long , not only their lives , but it would not just be their life to <unk> , but also ,
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income does not all -- not just to the poor people -- because of this choice in <unk> that <unk> us .
So , &quot; <unk> , you can become everything you want , &quot;
<unk> , people in culture , they said , &quot; What are you going to do that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s <unk> that you can &apos;t do anything in a glass of glass . &quot;
&quot; A <unk> imagination , a <unk> view of the world -- &quot;
and <unk> it , I <unk> it like this , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I realized that that fish know that fish know that fish has a long knows .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you <unk> the <unk> , so that &quot; everything is possible , &quot; you don &apos;t <unk> freedom . &quot;
If you <unk> the <unk> so that you can <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
They all need a <unk> .
This is almost certainly <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
