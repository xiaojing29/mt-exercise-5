<unk> year I showed these <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is almost three million years of the <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> percent .
And this <unk> <unk> <unk> , because it doesn &apos;t show the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a sense , the heart <unk> <unk> system .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> is going to be a <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
As you see , you <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That &apos;s the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , five or more , is how the blood , which is the <unk> here from the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been on so .
This is a problem because the <unk> is <unk> <unk> around the ocean , where there are huge <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , are <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> , that <unk> could <unk> , that <unk> <unk> , that &apos;s <unk> this point of not <unk> .
In a few <unk> <unk> in <unk> the <unk> is already <unk> from water .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : She &apos;s <unk> . She &apos;s good . The question is if we <unk> it .
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> had never <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how you get <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> , here &apos;s where the sea <unk> .
These <unk> are <unk> .
<unk> on the planet : <unk> , the largest <unk> <unk> of the planet .
<unk> month , the scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of the ice is in <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> feet of <unk> , as in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the largest <unk> <unk> <unk> , you see new <unk> , which few years ago , and a few years ago , they were <unk> .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population <unk> <unk> by <unk> .
<unk> : This <unk> is the source of <unk> <unk> of this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same thing happens to water .
In California , <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis .
<unk> , as you read , as you read , they &apos;re <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the world leads to a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> outside and <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years than <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> .
If you look at the context of the <unk> , you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve <unk> <unk> million <unk> of CO2 <unk> in every day .
Look at the area of the <unk> <unk> , from <unk> , and on both parts of the <unk> <unk> , where there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the ocean .
The <unk> of global <unk> , together to <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with more <unk> , together to China .
And you <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> .
But we &apos;re <unk> to a <unk> of the direction .
These are the <unk> in the last few years and some <unk> <unk> .
And every way , there &apos;s a <unk> politics in our country .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I <unk> image to me <unk> something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it on the <unk> .
This is the largest <unk> <unk> <unk> in America .
It &apos;s happened around <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> is a <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> in America , and it &apos;s <unk> our economy .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> here is a lot of <unk> <unk> .
The largest <unk> society <unk> on the <unk> <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
<unk> : So , the <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a part of them , a part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> , we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
For our <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public <unk> and <unk> the truth about <unk> .
Actually , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it &apos;s <unk> -- it &apos;s also a good <unk> .
So , not <unk> climate change .
You can do it .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you &apos;ve heard about a lot of them .
So , I <unk> a structure of <unk> for <unk> as about <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> are a little <unk> , but this is the sound of the <unk> of <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> is between the <unk> <unk> <unk> , but the <unk> technology , but the <unk> technology of <unk> that you see all .
And you look at a look at the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> and the national security .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> America is in the crisis ; the economy , the national <unk> , the national <unk> crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all : our <unk> from <unk> <unk> , like <unk> <unk> and oil <unk> .
Now , there &apos;s a new , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan to <unk> America to work , <unk> more <unk> , and help <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we <unk> to solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
<unk> : This is the last .
<unk> : <unk> : It &apos;s about <unk> energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> to <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , the sun , a new <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> for jobs .
<unk> : <unk> America . It &apos;s time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A <unk> <unk> <unk> says , &quot; If you go to the <unk> , you go from the only one .
If you want to go far , you go , you go back , you go back , you go back , you go back , you go far , you go back , you go back to , you know . &quot;
We have to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED I did a <unk> on <unk> .
And <unk> of <unk> to <unk> on how the machine works .
So , I &apos;m going to go . And for the ones that the other time there were no <unk> , the <unk> is the largest <unk> experiment .
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were less than a <unk> of a second from the beginning of the universe -- to <unk> million times per second .
All of this is simply <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk> .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> <unk> feet and he &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> picture of <unk> in building so you can see the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> last year , we <unk> the machine for the first time .
And this was <unk> by <unk> .
It was because of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
It &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> particles that had done all over the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> particles in the <unk> .
In other words , when I <unk> that image the <unk> , the <unk> that the <unk> machine , which is a big <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if it was this <unk> to us more or this , when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the <unk> was this .
That means we had a <unk> impact on the scientific <unk> .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to be just these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine works on the <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you <unk> and <unk> , &quot; It &apos;s not true . I &apos;m <unk> too <unk> . I &apos;m <unk> too <unk> . &quot;
And instead they can do it because when they &apos;re very <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees , at a temperature <unk> to that the space between stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> between the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> of <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the <unk> .
Now , this is more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s <unk> about 30 <unk> .
It &apos;s about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
Now they &apos;re <unk> all at their <unk> .
<unk> the end of <unk> <unk> is going to be new <unk> .
<unk> , and we <unk> to get data to <unk> or <unk> , and keep on the way we could find out what the <unk> are the <unk> that <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , in a way , these <unk> <unk> <unk> the value of science and engineering <unk> . It &apos;s easy to <unk> .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s so hard , I think it &apos;s the value of things like <unk> .
And I &apos;d like to end with the words of a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , his <unk> was <unk> , and he said , &quot; No <unk> . &quot; <unk> is so <unk> for the human mind , and he said , &quot; No <unk> , that are <unk> , there are no <unk> in nature , which our <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to <unk> when , from kids , <unk> with <unk> .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , actually , to think and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that <unk> most of the world around us .
So from <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> objects , together to my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started <unk> , and I started <unk> , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with both hands ,
and we <unk> to our <unk> ?
And the question was so interesting that we <unk> to explore the answer , building the <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , they can <unk> them , and they <unk> and they have a <unk> and they have a <unk> and <unk> .
But <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> it .
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> the digital information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , of others , and <unk> as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement , of others , as <unk> , we can explore new <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , with a simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you of the video , if we <unk> it in a direction , the <unk> <unk> , and if we <unk> on the other side .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , they <unk> them , they <unk> them .
If they come up , you <unk> and they can <unk> a little bit .
If they come up , you <unk> and they can <unk> a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
And we went to realize that one of the interesting <unk> was the <unk> to use <unk> on data , to example , &quot; <unk> a color as if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as <unk> and I can <unk> <unk> to <unk> the color in the middle of the <unk> , where you <unk> .
and I can <unk> for <unk> of color in the <unk> , where you <unk> .
If we &apos;re too much too , we can <unk> a little bit .
I &apos;m also <unk> <unk> , as <unk> , as <unk> , the mathematics and <unk> , where people can try things quickly , and <unk> the results immediately .
Now , I &apos;m going to ...
This is a <unk> sequence of <unk> I do with a <unk> <unk> program .
So here we have a <unk> of words that is <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , to every <unk> a letter to case on every <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , at every <unk> <unk> a letter to case , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . And as he <unk> <unk> on a <unk> .
And then after about 30 seconds , you <unk> , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities of <unk> .
Thank you .
So here &apos;s the <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , I did it in a way that I <unk> them and <unk> them .
They &apos;re very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things like this <unk> is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of <unk> .
And I just say , &quot; <unk> of words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , there on the right .
It actually wanted to <unk> .
They were only <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> building a tool for the <unk> of <unk> . He &apos;s <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the <unk> , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the <unk> , <unk> their <unk> .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now , he brought a <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> !
So , <unk> <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
-- <unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with the final <unk> , and he can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with the final <unk> , and he can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have a <unk> of time , I &apos;m going to show you is a <unk> , for <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> , <unk> recently , to <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> here <unk> <unk> from <unk> as <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of these has four different <unk> , and you can choose to choose .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of <unk> to your <unk> .
And we just <unk> to do <unk> a sound and a <unk> . &quot;
These are actually , you can control from live , as the <unk> and the <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are the effects of time and <unk> , which is <unk> to the entire sequence .
It &apos;s as it works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> in two <unk> , &quot; sequence , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , another <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m going to <unk> a <unk> .
<unk> : Now , <unk> : <unk> <unk>
<unk> : <unk> : And now I <unk> the <unk> to <unk> , so I can control the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> : I can <unk> the entire sequence of the time on one side or on the other side .
<unk> : <unk> : And now I <unk> the <unk> to <unk> .
<unk> : I can <unk> the sequence . I can <unk> the sequence .
So I don &apos;t have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk>
And now , I finally , I can <unk> the entire sequence on the left the <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain work and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some of the <unk> that we &apos;re trying to bring out from the lab .
The concept I want to <unk> is that it &apos;s <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> with media <unk> , which <unk> information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I can &apos;t see the time of talking to you .
I &apos;m a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it &apos;s more than this , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the <unk> of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like that .
But , this is something particular happened in my life and in my career , and in my career , which has brought me to <unk> the entire <unk> with this work .
The particular thing is I wrote <unk> this book , this <unk> called &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which is <unk> , for some reason for my <unk> , for some reason for a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere , the people <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
<unk> me to me and say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear of them , and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t want to do better ?
You don &apos;t have to write to write all life without <unk> to write a book that can <unk> to someone ? &quot;
What &apos;s going to someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> , you know .
But it could go to the worse , I remember the <unk> <unk> than 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> to the same <unk> from fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t be able to have success ?
You don &apos;t fear that the <unk> <unk> you ?
You don &apos;t have to do this <unk> for all life without any life , which is ever outside and die on a <unk> of dreams , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
So , you know .
The answer -- the short response to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I have fear of all those things .
I &apos;ve always had fear .
And I have fear of many other things that people can &apos;t <unk> .
As <unk> and other things are <unk> .
But , as it &apos;s about the <unk> and write me , I thought , is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It &apos;s <unk> that anyone who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel to do .
But what &apos;s so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> do ?
Like my father , for example , he was a <unk> and I didn &apos;t remember one single time in his 40 years of activity in which was asked if he had fear <unk> ?
It never was -- that <unk> <unk> <unk> , John <unk> , as it goes ?
You don &apos;t know how , you do ?
<unk> , the <unk> <unk> as a group didn &apos;t have , in <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
We have enough , we have this <unk> , and not only <unk> , but we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
And I didn &apos;t want to look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often for them .
And the ones who are not <unk> to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before you die , in the last <unk> said , &quot; Every book , I got a little bit more <unk> than a <unk> <unk> about work .
But we didn &apos;t <unk> when we <unk> it , because we &apos;ve heard these things so long , we have heard <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> , and the art , at the end , at the end , <unk> , <unk> , and we &apos;ll always <unk> to <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> to all here today is : you &apos;re <unk> with this idea ?
It &apos;s going to you know this thing -- because it &apos;s also going to be a <unk> <unk> at all this <unk> .
I think it &apos;s <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s also <unk> and I don &apos;t want to <unk> in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better <unk> our <unk> <unk> to live .
And I certainly know , in my case -- in my <unk> -- it would be very <unk> to <unk> to the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I am in my career .
<unk> -- <unk> look at the <unk> , I &apos;ve about 40 years .
I still have four <unk> of work in me .
And it &apos;s very <unk> that anything <unk> in the world , and then it &apos;s going to be <unk> by the world as the work that <unk> after the <unk> of my <unk> book .
<unk> <unk> , because we &apos;re all <unk> , because we &apos;re all <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> that my <unk> is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , who thought !
You know , this is the kind of <unk> that leads a person to begin <unk> at the nine <unk> of the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I started doing this work I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so , it looks like a lot , after a lot of work to write is to write about creating a <unk> <unk> <unk> , right ?
I have to have a <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;m <unk> , and my natural <unk> on which I &apos;m <unk> , and my natural <unk> on what he wrote is going to get to look at the time , trying to find other society to see if we could have <unk> , trying to find other society to see if we have <unk> ideas and <unk> .
as to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research <unk> me to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
because they <unk> in <unk> and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don &apos;t believe that creativity <unk> <unk> , OK ?
It turns out that creativity was this <unk> <unk> and that <unk> to men from a few <unk> and <unk> , for <unk> reasons and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity <unk> <unk> of creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from far away .
<unk> were the same idea , but we <unk> the kind of spirit without a <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> , because the <unk> didn &apos;t really know that a <unk> was particularly <unk> .
And I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that was literally in the <unk> of the study of an artist , a little bit like <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> out <unk> to <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the <unk> of that work .
<unk> <unk> here , that &apos;s the distance I talk -- that <unk> <unk> you from the results of your work .
And everyone <unk> that was so that we were <unk> , right ?
So the artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like for example , the too <unk> , right ?
If your work was <unk> <unk> , you didn &apos;t get to <unk> all of the <unk> , you know , you know , if you were <unk> from this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it wasn &apos;t your <unk> , right ?
All of <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
And then the <unk> and all <unk> , and <unk> this big idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe above all and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the <unk> <unk> and people who <unk> to think that creativity is <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And for the first time in history , you <unk> to <unk> this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think that was a big <unk> .
I think I &apos;m going to give someone , a simple person to believe to be as a source , the <unk> and <unk> of all <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a responsibility to give the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s as to say , somebody &apos;s like <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> and <unk> all of these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure <unk> to have <unk> artists in <unk> 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think it &apos;s , the question is , and I think ?
Can we do it ?
<unk> back to a <unk> understanding of human relationship between human <unk> and <unk> .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can &apos;t <unk> 500 years of thinking about <unk> in a <unk> talk .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you make people <unk> <unk> to <unk> about their projects .
<unk> doesn &apos;t probably tell you all about this thing .
But the question I want to <unk> is -- why ?
Why don &apos;t you get this way ?
Because it &apos;s more sense of any other thing that has ever heard about to explain the <unk> <unk> <unk> process .
A process that , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so , basically , all here -- knows , you know , you don &apos;t get <unk> .
And in fact , it &apos;s a <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which has now been <unk> , but it was a <unk> for the whole life and said that he was a <unk> for the <unk> , and he said that , in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . And <unk> , inside the <unk> <unk> .
He said , he was like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> <unk> to her from <unk> .
<unk> it , because he was <unk> the earth under his feet .
And he was to have one thing to do that point and was to be , &quot; <unk> as a <unk> . &quot;
And so he was <unk> to home and he was <unk> by this <unk> , and he didn &apos;t have to take a piece of paper and a <unk> <unk> , and <unk> on the page .
And sometimes it &apos;s not going to be <unk> , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> the <unk> <unk> through and <unk> the <unk> and she would <unk> them to <unk> through the <unk> , trying to <unk> them , trying to <unk> them , looking for as a <unk> , &quot;
And then there were those times -- this is never <unk> -- there were no <unk> . There were times , right ?
So , he was <unk> at home and he was trying to <unk> the <unk> and <unk> the <unk> through , and he was <unk> a <unk> in the while he was <unk> , and he said , which was like , if you <unk> with the other hand and the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the page and <unk> , but the <unk> , from the last word to the first word .
So when <unk> <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s exactly <unk> , it &apos;s exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not all my <unk> process -- I &apos;m not a <unk> .
I &apos;m a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; I <unk> at the same <unk> every day and <unk> and <unk> it on the <unk> .
But I have <unk> , in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I &apos;m going to say that many of you have the <unk> .
You know , even though the work and the ideas <unk> me to get me to a certain source , I could not <unk> .
And what &apos;s this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it to it in a way to do not <unk> the head , but rather than that we do <unk> ?
And I &apos;m going to me , the best example I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;ve <unk> different years ago for a <unk> .
<unk> of this , and you know , <unk> , and <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of <unk> , trying to control , <unk> , <unk> , these species of <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , he was <unk> , and a day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> all for him .
<unk> <unk> , and all of a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which is in his head as a <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and it &apos;s wonderful , and it &apos;s wonderful , and the <unk> , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the <unk> , but not as <unk> as <unk> .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it &apos;s not a <unk> , it &apos;s got a <unk> .
So , he starts to hear this species of old <unk> in him like , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and <unk> <unk> <unk> from this <unk> song .
I &apos;m not <unk> and I can &apos;t <unk> . &quot;
And instead of going to go to <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> the entire process and he made something completely new .
And he just <unk> the sky and said , &quot; <unk> , you don &apos;t see you I &apos;m <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Do you think it &apos;s going to write ?
If you really want to <unk> , you want to a <unk> moment when I can <unk> care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And his process <unk> <unk> after this .
It didn &apos;t work , the work was still <unk> as always as always as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> was <unk> when he <unk> was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> of him , and <unk> <unk> it back to where it was <unk> , and <unk> it was not going to be a <unk> and <unk> .
but I was <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> <unk> a conversation and this thing <unk> and <unk> that but it was not <unk> .
So how much <unk> that story is going to change a little bit a little bit of a way I <unk> and I &apos;ve been <unk> .
This idea , I was <unk> when I was <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; and <unk> in one of the <unk> <unk> in which we &apos;re working when we &apos;re working on something and we &apos;re working on something , and we start thinking about a <unk> , which is going to be a <unk> , which is going to be the book .
Not only <unk> , just the <unk> book .
And I started thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I <unk> to <unk> the air and <unk> .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of the room .
And I said to <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , what , we know , we know that if this book is not going to be <unk> .
Because as you see me I &apos;m not <unk> all I have , I have no longer than this .
So if you want you to get <unk> and you have to do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know , you don &apos;t do it .
I started writing the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I want to <unk> that was <unk> I &apos;ve been <unk> to do my part . &quot; Because at the end is so , OK -- <unk> it &apos;s so , OK -- <unk> it &apos;s so , OK , <unk> it &apos;s so , and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> that <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> hours to <unk> hours to <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk> .
But every so , I <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> in fact , <unk> ,
And I know what I talk about , because I know you have seen all of a point , at a <unk> , a <unk> .
It was like if the time , it was like <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> through a species of <unk> and it was not doing anything different from , as the <unk> <unk> <unk> before , but all the <unk> <unk> .
And a sudden , not just as a human beings .
But it <unk> from <unk> and <unk> in <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , he <unk> with his name .
<unk> hands and <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you can still feel in the <unk> .
In <unk> , when an artist <unk> , something impossible to impossible and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
And it &apos;s <unk> because we need .
But the problem comes the day , for the <unk> , and when you <unk> and <unk> that are the 11 of <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of God &apos;s <unk> and <unk> God &apos;s no longer .
It &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> , and maybe you never get more to <unk> to the <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still as <unk> , and what does it have to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so <unk> if you don &apos;t believe , <unk> , which the most <unk> <unk> of your being come from you .
But I just <unk> you that you &apos;re <unk> from a <unk> of this <unk> part of your life you have to go to <unk> when you have done .
And , you know , if we think , we think about this way .
And so I started <unk> , and it &apos;s certainly like I <unk> for several months in the <unk> of the book that was going to be <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel from this is , not fear .
Don &apos;t <unk> . <unk> just your work .
<unk> to <unk> for your <unk> , any of it can be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> some <unk> <unk> , for a few <unk> , for a <unk> , for a moment through your <unk> , then , &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
<unk> , you do the same <unk> .
And &quot; <unk> ! &quot; <unk> ! &quot; You know .
I think and I think it &apos;s <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; <unk> ! &quot; You just have had a human love and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> : <unk> !
As I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects on the human genome on the human genome , on what it can <unk> and discovery of genes .
Now we &apos;re <unk> a new path : we started <unk> biology and now to <unk> the biology and now we &apos;re <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We &apos;ve always been trying to <unk> questions .
&quot; <unk> is a life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many <unk> I think they have <unk> to <unk> .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to <unk> terms .
We &apos;re <unk> from almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome is <unk> to <unk> from the world of the <unk> of the <unk> of the computer .
Now , we can we <unk> life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the most small species from the <unk> genome between those who can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to <unk> the genome to <unk> a <unk> .
We can be able to <unk> a <unk> of genes about 500 are here .
But when we look at his map <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> than our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at a time , it &apos;s very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell .
So , I thought that the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> in a way to <unk> <unk> the <unk> for <unk> some of these <unk> questions .
And so we started the <unk> of the <unk> . &quot; Can we <unk> a <unk> ? &quot;
Can the chemistry of making these big molecules that we never have been able to create before ?
And in <unk> , we can make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
And the speed with which we are able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the <unk> code , instead , <unk> rather slowly , but it &apos;s <unk> .
And our most <unk> <unk> <unk> on a <unk> .
We &apos;ve been <unk> over 15 years ago .
<unk> has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before <unk> .
But we found that <unk> of DNA is very hard .
There are <unk> of thousands of machines in the world that <unk> little <unk> , <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> process : the most <unk> is <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , to <unk> from the digital information about <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a little <unk> that <unk> bacteria .
We designed <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA <unk> <unk> .
And the interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> it in the bacteria , the bacteria <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> particles .
<unk> particles have been <unk> from cells , they &apos;re <unk> , and they <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ve been talking about the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that they have been <unk> this model .
They have more than you .
And I think this is a situation where the software is really going to build its own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we could do things in big .
<unk> building the entire <unk> of the <unk> .
They &apos;re more <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we thought of <unk> in <unk> <unk> , so that we can change the <unk> to understand what are the <unk> of a <unk> cell <unk> .
<unk> is <unk> , and if we <unk> information in a computer , these have to be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> , the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We found , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If we used that <unk> <unk> <unk> . If we used that sequence never <unk> in this .
A part of the process is design <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> with all other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build <unk> <unk> to build more small than <unk> .
<unk> elements here .
You probably have read that <unk> us <unk> .
So , we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> on four <unk> : <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , and there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> order to <unk> every <unk> .
So we can use the <unk> code for write words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did was at the beginning was <unk> .
Some of them have been <unk> by the fact that it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
We designed these <unk> <unk> to simply <unk> <unk> .
There are <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> in a way to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to them to get to <unk> <unk> .
And at all , we had these <unk> in <unk> so <unk> that we &apos;re <unk> to create a very <unk> <unk> <unk> as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to <unk> the process .
So , this looks like a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When we started these <unk> <unk> , much more than 100 <unk> <unk> , no longer <unk> directly in the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> biology .
So we have <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
So here &apos;s a example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In 12 hours -- 24 hours , it &apos;s exactly as it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and you <unk> to find new <unk> <unk> of water .
In fact , NASA has shown that this is happening .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we built using these <unk> , just using the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> them .
This image wasn &apos;t <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a <unk> of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we &apos;ve done a little time ago .
They &apos;re more <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s the largest <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by human <unk> .
It &apos;s got a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> <unk> <unk> , we <unk> <unk> pages only to <unk> this <unk> code .
Now , how do we do it work ? How do we <unk> ?
Of course , through a virus is a <unk> .
It &apos;s a little more <unk> when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s more simple when it &apos;s about cells , as our : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the <unk> process .
In <unk> , the <unk> is instead of <unk> in the cell , but we have <unk> <unk> that we are able to do a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> cell from a cell phone cell , and <unk> .
We have a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> species .
The two different are how men from <unk> .
We have <unk> some <unk> in the <unk> way to choose to choose to choose this <unk> .
He <unk> it <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And when we <unk> it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> went into the cell .
And <unk> <unk> that we didn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to <unk> it in there .
This is one of the major <unk> .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> from a few <unk> , <unk> in a <unk> , <unk> in a thousand new <unk> to that species .
So who thinks in evolution as a <unk> at the time you have <unk> , it &apos;s not <unk> of biology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell , you know , it was in the cell .
<unk> <unk> we have <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , and he <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> , <unk> , and we <unk> it , and we <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk> .
It has become blue <unk> to the genes that we have <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species , and you &apos;re <unk> of all in a new species , <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell .
All <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when we <unk> the code <unk> exactly what we &apos;ve <unk> .
Now , this might be <unk> <unk> , but we can <unk> the software , we can change things in a <unk> way .
Now , I &apos;ve already <unk> that here is not about <unk> -- but progress from the <unk> of the <unk> , and a half of evolution , and I &apos;ve already said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in which <unk> <unk> <unk> species .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s enough to be <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion people to <unk> billion in the next 40 years .
Right to give a example . I was born in <unk> .
Now , there are three people on the planet to <unk> in the <unk> ; there &apos;s going to be four .
We &apos;re <unk> now to find food , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for six billion people .
<unk> still <unk> to do it for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> <unk> .
That &apos;s it &apos;s mean percent of <unk> per day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process to <unk> , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
In more <unk> , we have to <unk> that <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
And on the day today , thank you to <unk> <unk> in all over the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I love thinking that are <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry only <unk> only a <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here are <unk> data from the <unk> reality and from our imagination .
Now , we have <unk> , thank you very much of <unk> , <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We can produce a big robots that can produce a million <unk> per day .
Think about these 20 million genes , or try to <unk> <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of a team , and create more <unk> biology , and create more <unk> biology , and create more <unk> .
And it &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> .
We can choose to choose <unk> , chemistry or chemistry , chemistry or <unk> production , <unk> production <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software that we &apos;re working on to be able to <unk> and design species to the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how to be .
We know exactly how their <unk> code .
Now we &apos;re <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> generation .
You saw you also have <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> was a <unk> .
We have <unk> <unk> and third generation that we &apos;re going to be <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> , or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> in matter , and we think we can achieve that , and we think we can achieve that first <unk> <unk> <unk> in about <unk> , and we think we can have the first <unk> of <unk> in <unk> generation .
<unk> <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> in the world , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> in the ocean , about <unk> feet <unk> to the temperature of water .
<unk> <unk> from CO2 <unk> as <unk> as energy as energy as energy as energy as energy as energy as energy as energy as energy as energy as energy as energy as energy as energy as energy as energy as energy as <unk> .
We &apos;re trying to understand whether we can <unk> CO2 , which can easily be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , we think we can be able to <unk> that the question is what the basic question . &quot; What is life is , we have the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole <unk> industry .
<unk> . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t ?
It &apos;s a main source of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working on the same <unk> to create <unk> .
You saw this year with flu , we &apos;re always back to a year and a dollar <unk> in less when it &apos;s about to find the right .
I think that &apos;s what you can change building <unk> in <unk> .
So , here &apos;s how the future is to look like <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> , <unk> , and finally <unk> cells .
We &apos;re so much <unk> to the people .
Our goal is to do in a way of living long enough to try to <unk> . Thank you very much .
First of all , I &apos;m going to show you , the most <unk> , some <unk> , the new technology that we have brought to a <unk> <unk> <unk> at a <unk> . This is <unk> .
It &apos;s about a environment where you can <unk> is at the local level that <unk> with a huge amount of data <unk> .
So , we &apos;re seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , for a <unk> <unk> , <unk> the images as we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big <unk> of data or images .
Most of the <unk> are <unk> pictures , but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It &apos;s not a difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen . It &apos;s also a very <unk> architecture . It &apos;s also a very <unk> .
This is a book , example of data not images .
This is the <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
And so , it &apos;s just a <unk> and not <unk> images , we can do a thing about the kind of a <unk> . It &apos;s about a real <unk> <unk> .
It could be a little <unk> to read a <unk> book .
I don &apos;t want to tell you .
This is a <unk> example . This is a <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s about a number of <unk> .
Every image of a big <unk> .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the <unk> experience of read the real version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature of a <unk> .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the <unk> .
We &apos;ve created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> the content of the <unk> .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or even other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
And I thought this <unk> <unk> to <unk> and other <unk> <unk> , not <unk> to be <unk> .
Of course , <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this not want to lose time , if we haven &apos;t to say that we have <unk> <unk> to be able to do this in the field .
These are all the <unk> in the U.S. <unk> above a <unk> <unk> .
So now I &apos;m going to do something else .
This is actually live on the web ; you can see it .
It &apos;s a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other one is a <unk> <unk> to the computer <unk> , a <unk> student of <unk> , a student of the <unk> of Washington , with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s live on the web , <unk> <unk> .
You can see when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from a picture to the other and have this kind of experience <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here actually has a meaning .
<unk> <unk> of the computer have <unk> these <unk> <unk> , together , so that we <unk> to <unk> places where the <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> at the level of <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> at the <unk> level .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you a few other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to go to one of the <unk> data and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> that we have done for the first time the summer of <unk> to show you what <unk> is really the key <unk> behind this technology , the <unk> technology . And it &apos;s not <unk> so <unk> by looking at the <unk> <unk> that we have in the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> and <unk> and so on .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> . <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> a picture that &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
So they &apos;re all <unk> <unk> and they &apos;re all <unk> to the <unk> in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to <unk> in this way .
You know , I would never thought about to get <unk> .
It &apos;s very <unk> <unk> . This is a kind of <unk> here .
I think we &apos;ll see that it &apos;s about a lot of different kinds of <unk> : from the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , a number , <unk> number , <unk> , <unk> , together in this environment .
And if I can , I can <unk> them to try and <unk> .
A lot of <unk> , etc .
<unk> here is a series of pictures -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from <unk> to the physics of this environment .
The <unk> is that we can do things with the social environment . This is now <unk> data from <unk> from the whole <unk> of how <unk> the earth , from the point of view , from the point of view , from the point of view , from the point of view .
All of those pictures become <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> of the parts .
You have a <unk> model of the entire <unk> .
Think about this as a <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> on the Earth <unk> .
It &apos;s something that <unk> in complexity , as people <unk> , and the <unk> that <unk> to the use of the use .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> from other people .
If somebody &apos;s the idea of <unk> all of <unk> , the name , my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of all of those data , and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> to <unk> in the space , and I can use the <unk> of anyone else , and have a social <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
Of course , a result of this is <unk> models of every part of the Earth , <unk> not only from <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> .
CA : I realized ? What &apos;s going on ? What &apos;s your software that &apos;s going to be able to do is that at a certain point , in the next year , all the pictures would be <unk> by anyone in the entire world &apos;s <unk> .
<unk> : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is basically , it &apos;s <unk> .
It &apos;s creating <unk> , if you want , in the images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the <unk> of the images .
And the thing becomes very interesting if you think about <unk> information that many of these <unk> images .
As when you do a research <unk> on the web , you <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> page on the web has a lot of information about the pictures of the pictures .
Now , what happens if that picture you <unk> to all your pictures ?
So the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is really big . It &apos;s a <unk> effect . It &apos;s a <unk> effect .
CA : <unk> , it &apos;s really amazing . <unk> . <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> <unk> is the <unk> that we don &apos;t have <unk> <unk> , between who <unk> the <unk> in the wind , the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to think that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that the idea that the world in which the world in which we live in there , there &apos;s only a model , but it &apos;s a <unk> of reality ,
<unk> a <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , right or a lot , many <unk> .
And of course , all of course , all of the <unk> <unk> .
All right . <unk> . <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> to <unk> .
We need to <unk> the death of death , so we didn &apos;t <unk> if you <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art .
What <unk> is the <unk> of the song , the <unk> of <unk> of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of <unk> .
He was the <unk> of my journey in <unk> a month , or a <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> , <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> , on the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
All of these <unk> <unk> , there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And if you <unk> a second , it &apos;s a <unk> that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and <unk> that <unk> the planet and is important for the <unk> of the planet as a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
<unk> is the <unk> of humanity .
It &apos;s the <unk> of what we are and what we can be in the species .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was success to <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all the species was or is on the <unk> of <unk> , because it &apos;s <unk> , or -- in the <unk> of the <unk> of the diversity -- and you don &apos;t even know about <unk> <unk> -- that &apos;s not <unk> at the <unk> <unk> -- that &apos;s the <unk> of <unk> .
The <unk> of all this is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not only <unk> from a <unk> or a series of <unk> rules .
One language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of the <unk> of every culture is in the material .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> , a thought , a <unk> of <unk> .
And the ones of those <unk> <unk> , as we &apos;re sitting here at least , at least half the <unk> .
They &apos;re not <unk> to kids , the <unk> that means , <unk> , which is not <unk> something , which are already <unk> .
What &apos;s more <unk> than the <unk> of being <unk> by <unk> , of being the last to talk about a language , of course , <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of someone in the world every two weeks : every two weeks , every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and door in the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> language .
And I know somebody you say , &quot; You don &apos;t know ?
The world would not be a better place if we <unk> all the same language ? &quot; <unk> , then we all <unk> . <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> of a <unk> thing that means that we can &apos;t talk about their language .
I &apos;d like to show you a journey through the <unk> --
A little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we &apos;re <unk> .
A lot of us <unk> that when I say , &quot; I mean , &quot; I really want to make different ways of <unk> .
So , for example , this <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , which <unk> to <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s not able to <unk> the blue color from the green because the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> , which <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . You have to <unk> a lot of language .
All of this has <unk> in the past <unk> , <unk> is that in these <unk> families , which are talking about six or seven <unk> to the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> to listen and then <unk> to talk .
And I was one of the most interesting <unk> with which I lived , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> that has had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
They did <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> had never seen anything of <unk> .
They <unk> the pictures from the earth , they <unk> to a <unk> , or a <unk> and , <unk> , no <unk> , they <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
But <unk> not only <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> between them .
<unk> percent of the <unk> was <unk> by their own .
We &apos;re <unk> at eight <unk> and we found two cases of <unk> , and we found that one of them was <unk> , and then they <unk> it , and then they <unk> it . <unk> it . <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> .
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species .
<unk> years old , I was <unk> a very interesting task when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me , if my <unk> <unk> <unk> me , if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> between the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
To make a sense of <unk> , I should have to understand the <unk> culture and that <unk> is not <unk> .
It &apos;s rather than a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Very interesting .
If you &apos;re going to <unk> the big <unk> of the world , what do you get me ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking about Africa that <unk> has no <unk> <unk> . And instead of the <unk> is not the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes interesting is that <unk> is the <unk> between life and death .
So <unk> do <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by <unk> <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> .
For this <unk> <unk> to say , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> go to <unk> to <unk> .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re <unk> , is the spirit that <unk> you , how do you get you ?
So , you <unk> to these incredible events . <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> with which I lived the most <unk> are the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . And once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> never been <unk> by <unk> .
In <unk> , I &apos;m <unk> from a <unk> , but their <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years , and they live in a world , and they live in a world of <unk> and <unk> in <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> years of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> . And now are <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
For all this time , they &apos;re <unk> to values , values that <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> .
And Al term of this incredible <unk> , they come out and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 , see an <unk> . And in that moment of <unk> <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk> , all that &apos;s <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , all that have learned in the <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ? <unk> as I said . I said .
It &apos;s <unk> . Now it &apos;s going to you . &quot;
They &apos;re called <unk> <unk> and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the <unk> of the world .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think about <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> in his <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and maybe these <unk> are more <unk> to the Earth of the <unk> of us .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> <unk> .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> , but because of the <unk> and <unk> , have created a <unk> of the Earth &apos;s <unk> not on the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> : the concept that the Earth can only be there because it &apos;s <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
What does that mean ?
And I mean that a <unk> of <unk> <unk> that <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s going to be a different <unk> and <unk> , and it &apos;s going to have a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> a mountain is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
That &apos;s the <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
And that made me a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If we started <unk> that these <unk> can create different , we start to understand some of them <unk> . <unk> this <unk> .
I <unk> this picture to <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes it fascinating is not the potential <unk> is <unk> , but his <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> by two things .
On one side , this <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> has a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> family <unk> said .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> .
If you &apos;re going to see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> that make a different <unk> of species , <unk> it <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . <unk> : <unk> &apos;t create a <unk> of electricity . <unk> : <unk> &apos;t it makes a <unk> .
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> , the man who <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
And the <unk> my <unk> can &apos;t be <unk> . And you can &apos;t tell you about being <unk> . <unk> <unk> , but they can &apos;t be <unk> . <unk> <unk> , because they &apos;re <unk> from a <unk> that &apos;s <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s possible to <unk> only if we <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
Now , it &apos;s the <unk> : the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> <unk> , the same kind of <unk> , the same kind of <unk> <unk> . The question is , in a <unk> of plants , like these <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , they make two <unk> <unk> , they make a <unk> version of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
We &apos;re using the big <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you <unk> to the <unk> , we &apos;re going to <unk> , &quot; <unk> us . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , who <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that our <unk> in the same species .
If you <unk> the <unk> as <unk> their <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , you don &apos;t know all ? &quot; I said , &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is , you get the <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
And so , that &apos;s not <unk> , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , &#91; <unk> &#93; the problem is that even the ones who have to the heart <unk> them , but in some way we <unk> to the history of our real world , and it &apos;s <unk> beyond our real world , and it &apos;s <unk> beyond .
In fact , the <unk> century , between 300 years , not <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk> , but rather as the <unk> was in which we <unk> and <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> diversity and <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> diversity and <unk> . Now the problem is not the change .
All <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities of life .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> didn &apos;t have <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> <unk> and <unk> as <unk> as <unk> as <unk> <unk> have <unk> when they <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> . It &apos;s the power .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
And if you look at the world , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , if you look at the world , you know that these are not <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> creatures and <unk> out of the <unk> <unk> that go beyond their ability to <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
<unk> a <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that has lived in the forest to a generation , and now <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or in the case of <unk> , are the <unk> that are <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> .
If we <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the <unk> <unk> of politics .
As <unk> <unk> , the <unk> physics of a <unk> , is <unk> at the <unk> level , but the <unk> , the <unk> of life of a <unk> , not only is <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> in certain <unk> , because it &apos;s going to be part of the development .
And you can &apos;t understand the <unk> <unk> until the beginning .
I have the <unk> miles from <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> <unk> , I realized what &apos;s behind . I realized there &apos;s the <unk> that we &apos;re going to talk about .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> in the <unk> .
The father &apos;s father <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
And the means that it &apos;s been <unk> to <unk> to the Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that he brought the <unk> in <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in <unk> at age of two <unk> <unk> <unk> , because he didn &apos;t have to live without him .
<unk> , which has done the same , was <unk> in <unk> .
A day <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to work for seven years .
<unk> <unk> can be <unk> , but the spirit of <unk> is from <unk> <unk> .
And finally , all of it <unk> to a choice .
<unk> living in the world <unk> or <unk> the world of <unk> or we want to <unk> the world of diversity ?
The big <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died said that his greatest <unk> was told that he was , in our <unk> to this <unk> <unk> of the world , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination , and one day , but one day <unk> us from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that was there were other possibilities .
And it &apos;s <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
<unk> <unk> , which has given us <unk> , which has made us <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> with the <unk> <unk> , by creating the <unk> of <unk> , by creating the <unk> <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
<unk> world has <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> story , not <unk> me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to go .
When these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the world is asked what it is to be human , <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all <unk> the possibilities of being what we are : a <unk> , which has to make it in a way that all the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> . And there are great moments of <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> island , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> , and this man , <unk> me , and this man , <unk> me , and he <unk> me .
<unk> government was not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> for <unk> , and in the <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> for his life , <unk> <unk> , and all his <unk> .
You know , you know , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn &apos;t <unk> from night or from the <unk> that <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> , and <unk> in your hand . When I did the <unk> , he <unk> them by creating a <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , he &apos;s <unk> another dog and it &apos;s <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> of <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to talk about <unk> ? <unk> : <unk> . And this , in different ways , &#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> government <unk> has <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> control of a <unk> area of a larger area of California and <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s their new <unk> . It &apos;s called <unk> . It &apos;s called <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> . <unk> all the <unk> resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , to end , I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> at least at least , at least , <unk> that they didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
For somebody &apos;s home .
<unk> <unk> of human imagination that <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> . And for us all of these kids , as the dreams of our kids , they become part of our kids , they become part of the <unk> <unk> .
For us , we &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> that <unk> never <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> --
&#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; , but we think that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell stories about the stories of the world . &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; <unk> million <unk> . &#93;
<unk> <unk> : <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public places in places , and we have to find a <unk> that <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> : the world &apos;s <unk> of <unk> in a world and we have to find a <unk> <unk> in a world and <unk> <unk> .
which <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you have heard about and <unk> <unk> , in the case you don &apos;t know .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
<unk> <unk> of what ?
<unk> <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> : &quot; If we want to <unk> our citizens . &quot; The way to do it is <unk> freedom . &quot;
The reason is , from one side , in fact that freedom is in the same value , is <unk> , <unk> for human beings .
<unk> is the fact that if we are <unk> , each of us can do this for just to do this , which is <unk> our <unk> , without any of <unk> in our name .
The way to <unk> the freedom is <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> people have , more <unk> , and <unk> is their <unk> , <unk> is their <unk> .
This , <unk> , it &apos;s so <unk> in the society that nobody <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it &apos;s also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made .
This is my <unk> . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I <unk> a simple <unk> on <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that nobody <unk> you can buy it &apos;s <unk> of your <unk> .
Here &apos;s what the <unk> is .
And then you go to the <unk> <unk> to buy a <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a big number of <unk> <unk> .
We can do six million and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in only one store .
<unk> <unk> that there is choice .
<unk> : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the <unk> <unk> , to <unk> that were <unk> by mom .
It &apos;s <unk> , you don &apos;t get it .
A <unk> of that , in the other one , was that the phone never <unk> .
These days , they went to .
Now , we have a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , especially between <unk> .
Here &apos;s the future .
My <unk> is in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
If you haven &apos;t seen the <unk> in the <unk> , you &apos;re very <unk> in the <unk> , you &apos;re very soon going to be .
And what the end is going on is that people go into the <unk> and does this question . And you know , is the answer ? The answer is , &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> : You don &apos;t happen in the United States you &apos;re <unk> from <unk> and the <unk> you have to do .
Instead , <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> says , &quot; OK , we can do ? &quot; <unk> , we could do ? &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and these <unk> <unk> . What do you want to do you want to do ? &quot;
You know , you said , &quot; <unk> , what do you do ? &quot;
And the <unk> says , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> it has these <unk> and <unk> . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do you ? &quot;
And you said , &quot; <unk> if she was me , what would you say ? &quot;
And the <unk> , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> that makes it look like a <unk> .
But actually , it &apos;s not that a <unk> and the responsibility for someone who knows something , <unk> the <unk> , <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and almost certainly , it &apos;s not <unk> . And so , it &apos;s not in the <unk> to make decisions .
There &apos;s a huge <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> to people like me and you , who if you think about it , you think about it , because you think , you don &apos;t think about it .
But if we can &apos;t <unk> , why do we <unk> them ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> that we call the <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
So , I &apos;m going to be a <unk> of choice , as you see in this <unk> , &quot; We don &apos;t want to <unk> the kids . <unk> their <unk> at the time . &quot; <unk> . &quot; <unk> we need to <unk> . &quot; <unk> we have to <unk> .
And we can <unk> as many times we <unk> .
The one means that every <unk> , <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
<unk> to the family and <unk> , a time the common perspective , almost for almost anyone , was that there &apos;s <unk> , and you <unk> to get <unk> , and you could <unk> it to be able to get the <unk> .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and even what to do after .
<unk> , all of it &apos;s really to play .
<unk> students very smart , and they <unk> them 20 percent in less than a time .
And because they &apos;re not <unk> , because they &apos;re not <unk> .
but why are they <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> or not ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> later ? I have to think before you ? I have to think before you ? &quot;
They &apos;re <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this is not <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and <unk> , and get not a good <unk> at my <unk> .
And they really need to do it . They &apos;re important .
Now , the work : we &apos;re <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because technology <unk> us work on the planet , every day , from every corner of the planet , <unk> from the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> , and I &apos;m not going to tell nobody , where the <unk> works .
I don &apos;t say , because I want to use it .
What does that mean , this incredible <unk> of choice that we have about the work ? That &apos;s we need to decide , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son , <unk> , with the cell phone in a <unk> , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , on the <unk> .
And even though they &apos;re all <unk> , every minute we see our <unk> , we &apos;re also <unk> , &quot; I have to answer this ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this <unk> ? I got to <unk> this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , &quot; all this makes the experience <unk> of your son , which would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the things we look , things and big , things , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but not all was a <unk> of choice .
The world today is <unk> to this : <unk> is , &quot; Is it a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? &quot;
The answer is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> them all know , so I &apos;ll talk about the <unk> .
<unk> this choice two two effects of people .
The first one , <unk> , is that it &apos;s <unk> instead of <unk> .
And so many <unk> in which choose , it &apos;s very hard to do it .
I &apos;ll give you a <unk> example : a <unk> study <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , with about a million <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
What she found out is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> in the <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s 10 percent in less than <unk> than when they &apos;re available . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> in which <unk> , is <unk> hard , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And <unk> , and again , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> never come .
<unk> that doesn &apos;t mean only that this is not only <unk> that these <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don &apos;t want to say that the decision is so <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re not <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> to five <unk> <unk> for year from <unk> <unk> , which would be <unk> to <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> .
And I think I &apos;m going to <unk> the world .
&quot; And to end , for the <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
You know , just take the right decision , if it &apos;s for <unk> , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and you <unk> the wrong <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even though we can <unk> <unk> and make choice , at the end is less <unk> by the result of how <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And this for a few reasons .
One of them is that with a lot of <unk> in which is <unk> , if you <unk> a and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that we could do a different choice that would be better . And that &apos;s what &apos;s happening is that the <unk> <unk> us to <unk> the choice , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the decision ,
even when it was a decision .
<unk> : The <unk> is <unk> <unk> of any <unk> that is <unk> of choice .
<unk> , there &apos;s what <unk> call <unk> .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well as <unk> as the value we give things to <unk> things from what <unk> is .
And you know , when there are lots of <unk> , is easy to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and be less <unk> than the <unk> <unk> and be less <unk> than the <unk> .
So here &apos;s an example . I <unk> with all the ones who are not New York .
But that &apos;s what it probably <unk> .
There &apos;s this <unk> to <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It &apos;s all about them .
Not <unk> . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; All of my <unk> <unk> are <unk> . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> right in front of the house . &quot;
And it <unk> two weeks from the idea that &apos;s <unk> -- every day , the possibility of <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> the <unk> for that we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the most of the <unk> that we have from <unk> , <unk> <unk> us <unk> us against how <unk> .
Here &apos;s another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It &apos;s about living the moment , and maybe maybe in the moment , and maybe in the way .
But the most important point is that anything you <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> , you &apos;re not going to do other .
The things that don &apos;t have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new <unk> .
It &apos;s almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were just a <unk> , just a <unk> and <unk> them from <unk> , and they were <unk> , just after <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of times , <unk> to go to the well .
So , I started <unk> a couple of the new when the <unk> were gone , and I said , &quot; I &apos;m going to have a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . &quot;
And the <unk> said , &quot; <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
<unk> them wants to <unk> or with <unk> ? &quot; <unk> &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> them wants to <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> -- &quot; <unk> to <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a little bit , and after a little bit , I said , &quot; I want to say , &quot; he had no idea what was , so on a <unk> . I got all of the <unk> <unk> , and then <unk> from the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with the best <unk> of <unk> I had ever had .
It was the <unk> . With that choice I had to <unk> the best .
But I was <unk> .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to <unk> .
And the reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I was <unk> <unk> . I didn &apos;t <unk> to me when I was just a kind of , but when we got 100 different , <unk> , at least a kind of had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After <unk> , after I was <unk> to <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in life of the people don &apos;t do that <unk> the <unk> that these have <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And this <unk> less <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of <unk> <unk> .
Because if I <unk> it , I &apos;m not talking about .
The truth is more <unk> to this .
&quot; He was better when he was worse , &quot; The reason he was better when he was worse , when he was worse was still possible to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are at the <unk> of <unk> .
You &apos;ve never <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , you want to do . &quot;
I mean -- small <unk> -- which I &apos;m really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn &apos;t have to do , I &apos;m not <unk> .
But <unk> is not always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> when there &apos;s only that kind of <unk> when there &apos;s only that kind of <unk> is that when you &apos;re not <unk> , and I &apos;ll tell you ? &quot;
&quot; Who is <unk> ? &quot; <unk> , the answer is <unk> .
The world is <unk> . What can we do ?
When there are hundreds of <unk> , and we <unk> a <unk> , and you <unk> a <unk> , and you &apos;ll see who &apos;s the <unk> , it &apos;s clear that the <unk> you &apos;re .
<unk> could do better .
With hundreds of <unk> , there &apos;s no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people are <unk> , even though the result is <unk> , they <unk> <unk> and <unk> them to them .
In the last years , the <unk> is <unk> in the world .
I think a <unk> -- not the only one , but the <unk> -- of this <unk> <unk> is just that people have experiences because the <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation , which <unk> is their own .
So the final result is that in general is that we &apos;re better , <unk> , but we &apos;re going to be worse .
I &apos;m going to tell you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and is completely <unk> . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no <unk> that a little bit better choice is better than <unk> , but from this doesn &apos;t <unk> that much choice is better than a little bit better .
There &apos;s a <unk> value , <unk> . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure that we have <unk> from a piece of a piece of <unk> that the choices we have <unk> our life .
Now , from <unk> <unk> -- I &apos;ve <unk> -- I &apos;ve <unk> -- from the point of view , the <unk> is <unk> .
What it allows this to choice in <unk> society is <unk> .
There are many places in the world , and you &apos;re <unk> , where the problem is not that have <unk> choice .
The problem is that they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I &apos;m talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what it does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> of money . It &apos;s a <unk> of money .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , is not just that are <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> .
It &apos;s going to be worse .
If a little bit of what in our society <unk> <unk> was <unk> in those where people are too few people have too much <unk> , it would be <unk> to <unk> , but also our life .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income is <unk> in all -- not just to poor people -- not just the poor people -- because of this choice in <unk> .
And so , I said , &quot; You can become what you want to be , &quot;
<unk> , people &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , &quot; What &apos;s going to be ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s <unk> that you can &apos;t get anything in a <unk> . &quot;
&quot; A <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and I <unk> it so , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I realized that the fish knows that fish know , the <unk> knows .
Because the reality of <unk> is that if you <unk> in <unk> , in a way that , &quot; all of the <unk> . It &apos;s possible . You <unk> the <unk> . It <unk> the <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> in a way that we can <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
All they need a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly <unk> for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
