<unk> year I showed these <unk> for <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for nearly three million years of the United States , <unk> , has <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> 40 percent .
I love this <unk> <unk> of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a way , the <unk> heart of climate system .
They <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
As you can see , it <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That &apos;s the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> in summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , five years or more , it &apos;s like the blood , that &apos;s where it &apos;s from the body .
In 25 years it was done this in the age of this .
This is a problem because <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> around the ocean <unk> , where there are enormous <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , are <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> from global <unk> , that amount of <unk> , that amount of <unk> , <unk> this point of not <unk> .
In some <unk> , we &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> is already <unk> by water .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> was <unk> with a <unk> <unk> last <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! Al <unk> : She &apos;s fine . The question is , if we <unk> it .
One reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the <unk> .
This is a river in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> never <unk> like that .
This is the <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea <unk> on <unk> , here is where the sea <unk> .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the planet : <unk> , the largest <unk> of ice on the planet .
<unk> month scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of ice is in <unk> , and that the Western <unk> , which <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> at six feet of the <unk> , like <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the largest <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which few years ago were <unk> .
<unk> percent of the world &apos;s population <unk> <unk> by that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : this <unk> is the source of <unk> <unk> of this city .
The <unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same thing happens to <unk> water .
In California , <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> of 40 percent .
The <unk> <unk> are in crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they &apos;re <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the world leads to a <unk> increase in the <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> are starting to a <unk> out of the normal and without <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years of <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the whole <unk> .
If you look at it in the <unk> context , you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we &apos;ve <unk> million CO2 <unk> every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the oceans every day .
Look at <unk> the area of the <unk> <unk> , from <unk> , to <unk> , and on both the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , where there is a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean .
The biggest cause of global warming , together to <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of two countries with more emissions with China .
And you can build a lot of other <unk> <unk> .
But we &apos;re starting to a <unk> of direction .
These are the projects that last few years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
Every way , there is a political <unk> in our country .
The <unk> of <unk> and oil have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I <unk> image of <unk> something --
<unk> <unk> , where I live , there &apos;s been a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> .
You may have seen it on the <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> in America .
It &apos;s been <unk> around <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> the <unk> is a <unk> and happy .
It &apos;s <unk> here in America , and it &apos;s <unk> our economy .
<unk> <unk> is more and more <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> it .
<unk> : From here , this is a lot of <unk> <unk> .
The largest <unk> society on the <unk> <unk> is <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- not know what they are talking about .
At <unk> , the <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , one part of them .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> , we see the <unk> change as a <unk> <unk> <unk> in our business .
So our <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> for public and <unk> the truth about <unk> .
Actually , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it &apos;s <unk> -- it &apos;s got a good <unk> .
So we don &apos;t know about climate change .
We could do it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you &apos;ve heard about that a lot .
So , I &apos;m going to take a turn into the <unk> as far as <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> <unk> are a little <unk> , but this is the sound of <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> is between the <unk> <unk> of global warming , but <unk> technology that <unk> technology that you see change everything .
Let &apos;s look at this : the <unk> technology of <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security .
<unk> : <unk> , America is in crisis ; <unk> , national security , <unk> , the national security crisis .
The <unk> that all the <unk> : our <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
Now , there &apos;s a new one , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan for <unk> America to work , <unk> more <unk> , and help <unk> the global <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we can solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
<unk> : This is the last one .
<unk> : This is about <unk> energy in America .
One of the <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> the <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , a new network .
<unk> <unk> 2 : <unk> <unk> for jobs <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> America . It &apos;s time to be <unk> .
At the <unk> , he said , &quot; If you want to go <unk> , go alone .
If you want to go far , go together . &quot;
We have to go far away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED , I made an <unk> on <unk> .
And I &apos;m trying to <unk> on how the machine works .
So here we go . And for the ones that were not there , <unk> is the largest scientific experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were present less than a <unk> of the second beginning -- to <unk> million times a second .
This is just <unk> .
This is the <unk> machine .
<unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk> .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> feet and it &apos;s a <unk> feet .
This is a <unk> picture of <unk> in building so you can see the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of the last year we <unk> the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in the <unk> room .
It &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> of particles that had done all the turn of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles in the <unk> .
In other words , when I <unk> that image the 10 <unk> , I would say that the camera , which is a great <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if that was <unk> to make us <unk> , or this when somebody <unk> on Google and they <unk> that the <unk> page was this .
That means we &apos;ve had an impact <unk> on that scientific .
And in a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to be these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works when the car works at the <unk> of <unk> .
Now , the <unk> of you <unk> <unk> and <unk> , &quot; It &apos;s not true . I &apos;m too <unk> . &quot;
And they can do that because when they &apos;re very <unk> to become the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , at less <unk> degrees , at a temperature <unk> to that the space between stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and that are <unk> of about 30 <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , which we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
Now , they &apos;re now <unk> everybody in their <unk> place .
<unk> the end of <unk> <unk> is <unk> again .
We <unk> it , and we hope to get data <unk> or <unk> , and so on our <unk> to discover what are the <unk> that we <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the science and engineering <unk> . It &apos;s easy to <unk> .
I think it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s value of things like <unk> .
I &apos;d like to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which , in <unk> of <unk> experiments of his <unk> , his <unk> was Michael <unk> , said , &quot; No , it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> for the progress of human mind as <unk> that the ideas of science are <unk> , that our <unk> are <unk> , and that our <unk> are <unk> , and that are not <unk> new <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> <unk> to when , as a child , as a child , <unk> .
As we <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , we actually <unk> and to think and solve <unk> problems .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way most of the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects , with my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started to say , &quot; And if , when we use a computer , instead of having the <unk> <unk> as a digital <unk> that <unk> on a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> of information with both hands ,
and how about our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that we wanted to explore the answer , building <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a computer <unk> as big as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a computer <unk> as big as a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , they can <unk> their <unk> and feel their movement and have a screen <unk> and a <unk> <unk> .
But <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> them .
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> the digital information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement , other people , and as well as <unk> , other people , and <unk> of their own <unk> , to explore new <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
So , I &apos;ll start with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you some video -- if you put it in one direction , the <unk> video like this , if we were on the other side .
These <unk> are <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , they &apos;re going to <unk> what it &apos;s going around them .
If they <unk> , they <unk> it and they can <unk> it a little bit .
If they <unk> , they <unk> it and they can <unk> it a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We then realized that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> was the <unk> of data , for example , a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> like <unk> and <unk> , I can <unk> them to <unk> the <unk> of the color in that , where they <unk> .
and I can <unk> the color of the <unk> in the central color , where it <unk> .
We can <unk> them a little bit , we can <unk> a little bit .
There are also <unk> possibilities for <unk> , like <unk> , mathematics and <unk> games where people can try and <unk> things , and they <unk> the results immediately .
I &apos;m --
This is a <unk> sequence I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a game of words that is in half between <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> , a letter in <unk> , <unk> , at every <unk> , <unk> , at every <unk> , and as we <unk> to <unk> him on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try to do .
Thank you .
So here are <unk> kids in <unk> <unk> <unk> , I did so that I <unk> them and I <unk> a video .
They &apos;re very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things of this <unk> is that you don &apos;t have to <unk> people so many <unk> .
I just wanted to say , &quot; <unk> of the words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s a lot of people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , young people there on the right .
It actually wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : You have to build a <unk> for the <unk> . He &apos;s <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : I &apos;ve taken a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> work ! Yeah ! Yeah !
So , I <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can make the characters and <unk> can make the characters .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with open final , and it can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with open final , and it can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example of the time I &apos;ve got to show you is a <unk> , and I just did , and <unk> music .
It &apos;s a tool , that &apos;s a recent tool , for <unk> and <unk> music .
The <unk> here is <unk> from <unk> like base , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of these has four different <unk> , and you can choose which to use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence sequence from <unk> to your <unk> .
And they just <unk> by doing a <unk> <unk> <unk> and a sequence .
These are effects that you can control from alive , like <unk> and <unk> .
They &apos;re going to be a particular <unk> and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are <unk> effects as time and <unk> , that it <unk> to the whole sequence .
<unk> how it works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> one base in two <unk> <unk> , &quot; sequence , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot;
Now , I &apos;m going to take a <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I &apos;m going to <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : And now I &apos;m going to take the <unk> to the <unk> , so I can control the <unk> .
<unk> : I can <unk> the whole sequence time for the whole time from one side or the other .
<unk> : <unk> : And now I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> <unk> to give more <unk> .
<unk> : I can <unk> the sequence &quot; <unk> . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> it , <unk> long or more <unk> .
And now , I can <unk> the whole sequence on the left the whole <unk> on the left the <unk> &quot; <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , how our brain works and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this path , and some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to <unk> is that it &apos;s <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> the <unk> , which <unk> in our world the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s a love and the <unk> of my life .
And it doesn &apos;t look like me .
But , I said that , something particular happened in my life and in my life , which led me to <unk> the whole relationship to <unk> the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I <unk> wrote this book , this <unk> called &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; which , <unk> , &quot; my <unk> books , for some <unk> reason in the world and <unk> a big <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that I &apos;m <unk> now , people will <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> .
I &apos;m going to go to me and say , &quot; Don &apos;t you any <unk> that you can &apos;t be able to do better ?
<unk> &apos;t you have to <unk> all of life without being able to create a book that can help you make a book that can help someone to go ? &quot;
How can you get to somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> , you know .
But it could be worse , except I remember that I was more than 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was an <unk> .
I &apos;m going to take back to the same <unk> <unk> .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you worry about how to have success ?
<unk> &apos;t you that the <unk> <unk> <unk> you ?
<unk> &apos;t you <unk> to do this <unk> all over life without <unk> , and dying on a <unk> of <unk> dreams with the mouth of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> ?
So , you know .
The <unk> answer to -- the <unk> answer all of these questions is , yes .
Yes , I <unk> of all those things .
I &apos;ve always been <unk> .
And I &apos;m afraid of many other things that people could not <unk> .
Like <unk> and other things that are <unk> .
But , what it &apos;s about writing about it , and it <unk> me is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It &apos;s <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel to do .
But what is so particular about the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> about health <unk> in a way that others do not ?
How do my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and not remember one time in his <unk> , in his <unk> , in fact , when he was asked if he was <unk> <unk> ?
There was never -- that <unk> of the <unk> John &apos;s , how did it ?
Don &apos;t <unk> that way , <unk> ?
<unk> , the engineers <unk> like <unk> don &apos;t have certainly in <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
We have enough , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> but <unk> of all sorts of things , we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
And there &apos;s no other than just <unk> to look at the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> young and often <unk> as they .
And those who don &apos;t seem to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before I die , in the last <unk> said , &quot; Every my book I <unk> a little bit more &quot; -- an extraordinary <unk> about this work of its life .
But we didn &apos;t know when we did it because we &apos;ve heard these things so long that we &apos;ve had these things completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and creativity <unk> are somehow <unk> and that art , at the end , it &apos;s always about <unk> .
And the question I want to ask you all here today is , are you agree with this idea ?
You &apos;re fine , because it &apos;s also going to be <unk> from a <unk> distance to me not is good for anything .
I think it &apos;s <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s also <unk> , and I don &apos;t want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to <unk> our <unk> to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in which I &apos;m in my career .
<unk> -- I mean , look , I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;m about 40 years old .
I still have about four <unk> of work in me .
And it &apos;s very <unk> that whatever <unk> of time in the world , as the work that <unk> after I <unk> it of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we are all about friends here -- it &apos;s <unk> that my biggest <unk> is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> thought !
You know , the kind of thinking that leads to a person to start <unk> <unk> to nine in the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I &apos;m going to continue doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so , it looks , after many <unk> , that the way to work on doing is to create a <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I &apos;ve got to <unk> a few ways of security , which I &apos;m <unk> , and my natural <unk> that <unk> that <unk> that <unk> that <unk> that last year to get . And while I &apos;m going to <unk> it to look through the time , trying to find other societies to see if you have to have a <unk> of the best ideas and more <unk> ideas .
how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research led me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re going to be because they &apos;re going to go back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don &apos;t believe that creativity <unk> from men , OK ?
It turns out that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> with men from some <unk> and <unk> , for <unk> and <unk> for <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity <unk> of creativity <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from far away .
The <unk> were the same idea , but they were <unk> that sort of spirit without a <unk> .
which is <unk> , because <unk> didn &apos;t really know that a <unk> was particularly <unk> somebody who was particularly smart .
I thought that a <unk> was this sort of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally <unk> into the <unk> of the study of an artist &apos;s study , a little like the <unk> <unk> , and it <unk> out of <unk> the artist &apos;s work and <unk> the <unk> of that work .
<unk> <unk> , that &apos;s the distance I &apos;m talking about -- that <unk> <unk> you &apos;re going to <unk> you from your <unk> .
And everybody <unk> that was so <unk> , right ?
So the <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like too <unk> , right ?
If your work was <unk> not to <unk> <unk> all the <unk> , you all know that you &apos;ve got <unk> from this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it wasn &apos;t all your <unk> , right ?
Everybody thought it was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and everything , and we <unk> this great idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe , above all of the <unk> and <unk> and no longer <unk> <unk> <unk> creatures that <unk> from <unk> .
This was the <unk> principle and people started to think that creativity was completely <unk> by <unk> .
And for the first time in history , it &apos;s going to be <unk> to this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> with a person with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think of <unk> to someone , a simple person to believe that &apos;s how a <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a responsibility to too big to give to human <unk> .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> the <unk> and creates all these <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think that was that <unk> the artists that are <unk> 500 years old .
And , if that &apos;s true , and I think it &apos;s true , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do that ?
They want to go back to a <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t take 500 years of thinking <unk> in a talk about 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on their <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , do that <unk> people <unk> <unk> to <unk> on their projects .
I &apos;m probably not going to <unk> you all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to ask you to think is -- why not ?
Why not we are we going to <unk> this way ?
Because more sense of everything that I &apos;ve ever heard to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> process .
A process that , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so basically , all of course , you know , don &apos;t <unk> <unk> .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seem completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s now 90 years , but it &apos;s been a <unk> for the whole life and said that during his <unk> , <unk> , <unk> out in the fields , and they <unk> it , inside the fields , and they <unk> it , inside the fields , and they <unk> it , in the fields , and they <unk> it .
And he said that was like a <unk> <unk> of air .
And that <unk> to her from the <unk> .
I <unk> it to get , because it <unk> the land under its feet .
I decided to have one thing to do , and that was , words , &quot; <unk> as a <unk> . &quot;
And so we went back to home and came from this <unk> , and it wouldn &apos;t have anything else to take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> , and they <unk> on the page .
<unk> times you can &apos;t get enough for being fast , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> them up and <unk> her <unk> through and she would <unk> them through the <unk> , looking for , and she would <unk> them , looking for her , and she would <unk> her , and she would <unk> them , and she would help them through the <unk> , and she would <unk> through the <unk>
Then there were times -- this piece of paper never <unk> it -- there were moments when the time was almost <unk> , right ?
So , he was coming back home and he was looking for paper and <unk> it through , and he took a <unk> just in the while he was <unk> , and then he said , that was like , if you <unk> with the other hand and <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> and the <unk> in his body and <unk> it into his body and <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk> , but <unk> , from the last word to first .
So when I <unk> <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not a <unk> process of my <unk> -- I &apos;m not a <unk> !
I &apos;m a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; I <unk> to <unk> <unk> and work and <unk> over <unk> .
But even I , in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I &apos;m <unk> that many of you the <unk> .
You know , even though the work and ideas I <unk> from a certain source , I could not <unk> <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it in a way to <unk> not to <unk> the head , but rather , that &apos;s what about <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
As far as I am , the best example of this is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;ve <unk> several years ago for a <unk> .
I was talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the artist <unk> <unk> , trying to control <unk> , <unk> these sort of <unk> <unk> totally <unk> .
But then I was <unk> , and one day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , <unk> it , <unk> it all for him .
<unk> <unk> and everything about a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> , which comes in his head like <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the <unk> , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the <unk> , but not know how to <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
So it starts to hear this kind of old <unk> in him like , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose it on , and I &apos;m going to <unk> by this <unk> song .
I &apos;m not <unk> enough and I can &apos;t <unk> . &quot;
And instead of going to the <unk> , they <unk> .
<unk> the whole <unk> process and made something completely new .
He just got the sky and said , &quot; <unk> , do you see I &apos;m <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Do you think it can write a song hour ?
If you really want to <unk> , I &apos;m going to take care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> more <unk> today .
<unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And his process <unk> <unk> after that .
Not work , it was still <unk> as always <unk> .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that he <unk> that he <unk> , he <unk> that he <unk> that he <unk> away from where he was , <unk> that wasn &apos;t supposed to be a <unk> and <unk> .
but I was going to see this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> <unk> a conversation with this and <unk> thing , but it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
So how much that story I &apos;m going to change a little bit , even the way I &apos;m going to <unk> and I &apos;m going to <unk> .
This idea , I &apos;m sorry when I was <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; and <unk> , &quot; and <unk> in one of the <unk> of the <unk> in which we &apos;re all working on something and we &apos;re not , and you start to think that it will be a <unk> , that will be the book , that will be the book , and you start thinking , &quot; and you &apos;re going to think that &apos;s a <unk> , that &apos;s going to be the <unk> , you &apos;ve been
Not only <unk> , just the book <unk> .
And we started to think about <unk> this project .
But then I &apos;m going to <unk> that <unk> to air and <unk> us .
So I <unk> my face up on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> corner of the room .
And I said <unk> , &quot; <unk> , what , both of all we know that if this book is not going to be <unk> , my <unk> , right ?
Because you see I &apos;m <unk> all I have , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t , you know what , I don &apos;t do anything , I &apos;m not going to <unk> it .
I started writing the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to <unk> that I &apos;m <unk> today to do my <unk> . &quot; Because at the end of the North America , the people <unk> for the North Africa , the people <unk> to <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the moon , <unk> music , and <unk> music that I would <unk> for hours and hours to <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every once in the <unk> , <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists , actually <unk> .
And I know you know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you &apos;ve all got , at some point , a <unk> like this .
It was like time to <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and not doing anything different from the <unk> , like <unk> <unk> <unk> first , but it was <unk> .
And suddenly , it doesn &apos;t just <unk> as a human ,
But it <unk> out of the <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
And when that was <unk> , at the time , people knew what was , they would take him off his name .
<unk> hands and <unk> to <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , they <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; to &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; to &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which you can still feel in the <unk> or in <unk> .
In <unk> , when an artist did something impossible and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it &apos;s <unk> because we need it .
But the problem comes the next day , for <unk> itself , when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of God doesn &apos;t have more .
It &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> with big <unk> to the <unk> , and maybe it never <unk> to the <unk> .
And maybe no one name of God &apos;s still going to be <unk> , and what &apos;s going to do with the rest of your life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so <unk> if you can &apos;t believe , <unk> , that the most <unk> of your being are being <unk> by yourself .
But I &apos;m just going to show you that you data from a <unk> of this <unk> part of your life that you have to <unk> when you &apos;re finished .
And , you know , if we think it in this way , it all changes .
And so I started to <unk> , and it &apos;s certainly how I <unk> it for several months in the book that was soon , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of my success .
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel <unk> on this is , not <unk> .
Don &apos;t <unk> . You just have your work .
<unk> to your <unk> , whatever you can be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , you will be <unk> to you a <unk> of <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for one moment through your <unk> , then &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
<unk> , do the same <unk> <unk> .
And &quot; <unk> ! &quot; to you do the same .
I think it &apos;s <unk> and I think it &apos;s <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; to you do the same , even for <unk> love and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know I &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects about the human genome , what &apos;s going to be <unk> and discovery of genes .
Now we &apos;re now <unk> a new path , we &apos;ve started to <unk> the biology and now starting from that code digital code , we &apos;re <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We &apos;ve always tried to get big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; Is it something that many <unk> I think have <unk> to <unk> different levels .
We &apos;ve tried different <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> for almost 20 years now .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> , we will <unk> from the <unk> world of the computer the digital world .
Now , what can we <unk> life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> a little bit more .
We can <unk> a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that are here .
But when we take a look at his <unk> map , it &apos;s <unk> simple with our own .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes we can <unk> , one at a time , it &apos;s very <unk> that this can bring to a cell .
So the only way that the only way to <unk> this <unk> <unk> in order to <unk> some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of &quot; <unk> . &quot; Can we <unk> a <unk> ? &quot;
Can the chemistry <unk> to produce these big molecules that we &apos;ve never done before ?
And , in case , how can we make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> material .
The speed with which we are able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the code , instead , <unk> <unk> slowly , but it &apos;s <unk> .
And our <unk> results that have <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before they first <unk> .
But we &apos;ve discovered that DNA <unk> is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of the world that <unk> little <unk> of DNA , of the <unk> <unk> of 30 to 50 <unk> and it &apos;s a <unk> process . The more <unk> is , the longer <unk> is there .
So we had to develop a new way to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And that was our first <unk> , <unk> information , by <unk> information digital genome .
It &apos;s a little <unk> that <unk> bacteria .
We designed <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of about <unk> <unk> .
But what &apos;s interesting is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> it in bacteria , the bacteria <unk> this , and they <unk> the <unk> particles .
<unk> particles have been there with cells , they &apos;re <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I talked about recently with <unk> members of the <unk> industry that they have <unk> this model .
They have more than you .
I think this is a situation where the software actually can build its own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we could do the next thing .
They had to build the entire <unk> of <unk> .
They are more than <unk> <unk> <unk> of code .
So we thought we &apos;re going to <unk> in the size of the virus of the virus of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> information with information <unk> in a computer , these must be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time , the <unk> <unk> was of a <unk> for every 10 <unk> .
We &apos;ve discovered , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If we were used that original sequence never <unk> states to do it .
One part of the process is to design <unk> <unk> <unk> with all the other 50 <unk> <unk> to build <unk> <unk> to build <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> elements here .
You &apos;ve probably read that <unk> us of the <unk> .
So , we have a <unk> code for four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , about 20 <unk> , and there &apos;s a <unk> order of <unk> for every <unk> .
So we can use the <unk> code for writing , <unk> , <unk> .
So what we did at the beginning was <unk> .
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> <unk> them .
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , we made these <unk> <unk> in <unk> so that we &apos;re trying to create an extremely <unk> <unk> <unk> as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to <unk> the process .
So , this looks like a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When I started these <unk> <unk> , more than 100 <unk> <unk> , no <unk> <unk> into the <unk> <unk> .
It comes to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> biology .
So we &apos;ve <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA , and <unk> the <unk> .
Here &apos;s an example .
This <unk> , called the <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> like his <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> hours , it &apos;s <unk> as it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely <unk> .
<unk> to live under <unk> .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life in space , and it <unk> to find new <unk> of water <unk> .
Actually , NASA showed that this happens .
This is a picture of the <unk> we &apos;ve built these <unk> , just using the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a picture of not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s such a big <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a time of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we &apos;ve done a little bit of time ago .
They are more than <unk> <unk> of code .
It &apos;s the largest <unk> structure that has ever <unk> by man .
It has a <unk> weight <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a 10 <unk> without <unk> , it will take pages just to <unk> this code .
Now , how do we make it work ?
Of course , through a virus is a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a little bit more <unk> when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> in the cell , but we &apos;ve <unk> <unk> that we are able to do a <unk> <unk> from one cell to another and <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> species .
The two are different than men <unk> .
We &apos;ve <unk> some <unk> in a way that you can decide which you &apos;ve got to do with this <unk> .
He then <unk> it with the <unk> so that it <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the cell .
And we knew that we didn &apos;t want to go beyond , but we tried to <unk> more in there .
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution .
We &apos;ve discovered that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere , we have <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So those who think of evolution as a <unk> <unk> at a time that <unk> has not <unk> a lot of the biology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> DNA .
The <unk> that was in the cell , didn &apos;t take one .
The <unk> <unk> we have <unk> it .
It <unk> , and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material , it <unk> , and we <unk> it , and we <unk> it with only the cell the cell and the new <unk> .
It &apos;s become blue because of the genes we &apos;ve <unk> .
And in a <unk> of time , all of the <unk> of a species , you have to go <unk> , and it <unk> of all into a new species , <unk> the software that we &apos;ve <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code exactly what we &apos;ve <unk> .
Now , this may be <unk> <unk> , but we &apos;ll <unk> DNA , we can change things in <unk> enough <unk> .
Now , I &apos;ve already <unk> that here isn &apos;t about <unk> -- but progress from three million years and a half million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> , where we can <unk> new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We &apos;re going to <unk> <unk> billion people over the next 40 years .
Just to give you an example . I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in <unk> ; in <unk> , 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re <unk> problems now to find food , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , six and a half billion people .
We &apos;re going to be even more <unk> to do it for nine billion .
We &apos;re over five billion <unk> , over 30 billion <unk> of <unk> .
That means 100 million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process of <unk> process , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
In more we have to realize that all of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> today , because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> around the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry only <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here is <unk> data , <unk> <unk> , and our imagination .
We have <unk> , we have these <unk> <unk> of <unk> , able to create what we call the <unk> <unk> .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think of <unk> these 20 million genes or <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology that &apos;s <unk> in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to be <unk> <unk> , <unk> chemistry or <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software that we &apos;re working on to be able to <unk> and design species on the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how to be .
We know exactly what their genetic code is like .
Now we &apos;re <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> generation .
You saw <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a very large impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would <unk> the CO2 in matter before , which we &apos;re working on design , so that we &apos;re working on design , and we &apos;re working to design , and we think we &apos;re first thinking that we &apos;re working on to design , and we think we can have the first <unk> of <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> solar <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> , in our <unk> , we &apos;ve found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> we <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> in the ocean , at about <unk> feet deep down to the temperature of <unk> of water .
<unk> <unk> of the CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can <unk> the CO2 , which can easily be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> the CO2 in <unk> , to this process .
So , <unk> we can be able to <unk> what we might be able to <unk> what the basic question of &quot; is , &quot; We , <unk> , we have the <unk> goal for the whole <unk> .
<unk> . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t ?
It &apos;s a major energy .
<unk> , we &apos;re working on the same <unk> to use the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk> .
You saw this year with flu , we &apos;re always back a year and a dollar in less when it comes to find the <unk> .
I think that you can change building <unk> in <unk> .
So the future may be able to start <unk> look like <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> the evolution of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and finally cells <unk> .
We are so that from <unk> people to <unk> .
Our goal is to do in a way of living long enough to try to <unk> it . Thank you very much .
First of all , I &apos;m going to show you , the <unk> possible , some fundamental work , of the new technology we took to <unk> to a <unk> almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
This is a environment in which you can <unk> is local level that you can <unk> is a large level of <unk> .
Here we are seeing <unk> of <unk> photos with a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , for a <unk> <unk> , <unk> the images like we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big the <unk> of data or <unk> .
Most of them are common pictures that , but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that <unk> <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in any moment . It &apos;s also very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , which is a whole book , which is not about images .
This is the <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
So , to <unk> that it &apos;s just the text and not about images , we can do something like that , to actually see that it &apos;s a real <unk> of the text , not a picture .
It may be a way of <unk> to read a <unk> book .
I won &apos;t <unk> you .
This is an <unk> example . This is a <unk> number .
Every image big is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of how to read the real version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of The <unk> .
We created a <unk> <unk> much higher than the one that you use in a normal <unk> , and we <unk> the <unk> content .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even the <unk> <unk> .
And that really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
We believe that this <unk> will be <unk> to <unk> and other <unk> like that , not so much more <unk> .
Of course , <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for these kinds of technology .
And on that , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say that we have <unk> to give in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> over the United States ,
So now I &apos;m going to try something else .
This is actually live on the Web ; you can go to see .
This is a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> <unk> , a very interesting <unk> of <unk> , a student of Washington , with the help of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s live on the Web , <unk> by <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from the image to another and have this <unk> experience .
But <unk> <unk> of images here actually has a meaning .
The <unk> <unk> of the computer <unk> have <unk> these images together , so that they <unk> the <unk> places where the <unk> all close to the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk> . So you see here of the elements of a <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> , and these things were all <unk> <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to spend directly to one of the <unk> of <unk> data and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that we &apos;ve done for the first time last summer , I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> of what we &apos;re going to be really the key to show the <unk> that we put in the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> and so on .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> . <unk> of these <unk> <unk> and so on . <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> a picture that you have an image that you &apos;ve seen <unk> to this model .
So they &apos;re all <unk> <unk> and they &apos;re all <unk> <unk> on this way .
And it &apos;s possible to <unk> this <unk> way .
You know , I would never thought of <unk> to work for <unk> .
It &apos;s very <unk> <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think we &apos;ll see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of <unk> : from those cell phones to those phones <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I can , I can look at the <unk> those <unk> .
A lot of them are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
<unk> here is a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from <unk> to <unk> physics .
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now <unk> data from the whole <unk> of how to <unk> the Earth , from the whole <unk> <unk> and <unk> all that data together .
All of those pictures are <unk> together , greater of the <unk> of the parts .
You have a <unk> of the Earth that <unk> .
Think of it as the <unk> of <unk> &apos;s work on Earth <unk> .
It &apos;s something that we will <unk> as people as the <unk> , and the <unk> for those who <unk> <unk> it with the use of .
Their photos are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people .
If somebody comes the idea of <unk> , all these <unk> <unk> the name , my picture of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , they <unk> all of those data , and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> to <unk> in that space , in that <unk> , using the pictures , and the <unk> of a <unk> and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all of that is , extremely <unk> <unk> of every part of the land , <unk> not just by <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What &apos;s the software for you to do is that at some point , in the next few years , all the pictures that are that we are in the entire world , <unk> are basically going to be <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yes . What &apos;s doing is we &apos;re going to discover .
It &apos;s creating <unk> , if you want , in the images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the <unk> of <unk> .
And that becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> information <unk> that a lot of these <unk> images .
As you do a <unk> research on images , you get a <unk> and the text on the page , it has a <unk> and the text on the <unk> page .
Now , what happens if that picture <unk> all your pictures ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> that <unk> is really enormous . It &apos;s a very large effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it &apos;s really incredible . <unk> .
<unk> : I &apos;m going to <unk> you a lot .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is the <unk> to live between who has no <unk> <unk> , among the wind , the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> it in the <unk> <unk> of plants .
We think that <unk> <unk> still beyond <unk> <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , or that <unk> , the <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , and that the idea that we live in in there is no <unk> , but it &apos;s only a model of reality , but it &apos;s just a model of reality ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , well , a lot of <unk> is .
And , of course , everybody <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . Everybody <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We need to <unk> the death <unk> , so we don &apos;t know if we go and <unk> --
We all have an art .
What <unk> is the <unk> <unk> of the song , the <unk> of the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that matter the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> .
He was my <unk> of <unk> in <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , on the <unk> , the mother <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
All of these <unk> are <unk> that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you <unk> a second , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of the world are <unk> a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and it &apos;s important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> known as <unk> <unk> .
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> , the <unk> of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being from human imagination .
<unk> is the <unk> <unk> of humanity .
It &apos;s the <unk> of what we can be , and what we can be as <unk> species .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> much faster .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> just because it &apos;s <unk> , or -- in the <unk> <unk> -- in the field of diversity <unk> -- and not even at the most <unk> -- the <unk> diversity .
<unk> of that is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just <unk> by a <unk> or a series of rules .
One language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of the <unk> that the <unk> of every culture comes in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> , a thought , a <unk> <unk> .
And those <unk> <unk> , while we &apos;re sitting here at <unk> , at least half not <unk> in the <unk> of children .
They &apos;re not <unk> to children , which means less than to <unk> something , which is already <unk> .
What is more <unk> of the <unk> of being <unk> by <unk> , of the last to talk about being <unk> , or <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the children ?
This <unk> <unk> was the <unk> of somebody in a few weeks , every two weeks , every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and <unk> with them in the <unk> , the <unk> of a <unk> language .
And I know that somebody of you say , &quot; Don &apos;t that good ?
The world would not be a better place if we all the same language ? &quot; <unk> , we &apos;re all talking about . <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> of a <unk> thing that means that we can &apos;t talk its language .
I &apos;d like to do you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we &apos;re <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say &quot; different ways of <unk> &quot; I mean very different ways of <unk> .
So , for example , this <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , which <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s not able to <unk> the blue color from green because the time <unk> is <unk> in the forest because the <unk> of the forest , which <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; : you have to <unk> a person to talk a different language .
All of that has <unk> in the <unk> past , though <unk> is that in these <unk> where you talk are or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> no <unk> .
He was <unk> to listen and then he started talking .
I <unk> one of the most interesting <unk> that I lived with , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> contact with a <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;ve done <unk> from the top of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> forest <unk> had never seen anything .
They <unk> the pictures from the land , they <unk> the <unk> for a form or a <unk> and , and they didn &apos;t know anything , they <unk> that they <unk> the <unk> . They <unk> the five with the <unk> .
But <unk> don &apos;t just <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> with them .
<unk> percent of the death <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We went back to eight <unk> and we found two cases of natural death and we found two <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was so <unk> that it &apos;s dead , and then they <unk> it . They <unk> <unk> <unk> . And then they <unk> it . <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and to <unk> the species .
<unk> <unk> , I was a really interesting task , I was a really interesting task when my <unk> <unk> <unk> , if I wanted to go to <unk> between <unk> society and <unk> the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and
To make sense of <unk> , I should have to understand the <unk> culture , and the <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s pretty <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> .
If you were to <unk> the <unk> of the world , what would you <unk> me ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent is always left , thinking , that <unk> Africa doesn &apos;t <unk> <unk> . And instead , yes , and the <unk> is not something else that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> very <unk> during the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes interesting is that <unk> is the <unk> between life and death .
So <unk> do <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> in a way that for a short moment , the <unk> becomes the <unk> .
That &apos;s why <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> go to <unk> to <unk> God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . &quot;
And what you &apos;re <unk> , is the spirit that you <unk> , how are you going to <unk> you , how are you <unk> ?
So , you start to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> in the state of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather strong <unk> of the power of the mind on the body when it was <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> that I &apos;ve lived with the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> civilization <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> has never been <unk> by <unk> .
And today , I &apos;ve been <unk> by a <unk> , but their education is extraordinary <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> from <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years , and they live in a world that has been <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> <unk> years of the <unk> <unk> to <unk> nine months of <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the mother , now are <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
For that time , they &apos;re <unk> to values about their society , values that they <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to <unk> the <unk> <unk> -- or to <unk> <unk> .
And at the end of this incredible <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> out of <unk> and for the first time in their lives , at the age of <unk> , they see a <unk> . And in that moment of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , all the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , everything that they learned in <unk> all the <unk> . And it does a <unk> back and it <unk> back and says ,
&quot; <unk> ? <unk> like I said .
It &apos;s <unk> . Now it &apos;s <unk> .
They &apos;re called the biggest <unk> that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world &apos;s <unk> .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think about the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the old history of <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> concept in the <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are closer to Earth than Earth .
The <unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by <unk> .
There &apos;s no <unk> for these things in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> , but because of the <unk> , have created a <unk> of the Earth , it created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> not about <unk> <unk> <unk> but on a <unk> <unk> . The concept that Earth can only is <unk> by the <unk> human <unk> .
What does that mean ?
I mean that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> the mountain of <unk> that <unk> its <unk> is a human being <unk> <unk> a different human and will have a very different relationship with the mountain or that <unk> of a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a mountain or place to be <unk> .
<unk> of a <unk> or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is , the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
That made me a human being in my friends , <unk> , who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> .
If we started to <unk> that these <unk> can create different , we could actually create different <unk> , we could start to understand some of their <unk> .
I took this picture at <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
Some of you have heard about the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> <unk> is not the potential <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , but its <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> from two elements .
On one hand , this <unk> <unk> <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> you have a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit , but it &apos;s <unk> with a <unk> of a <unk> of the family <unk> said <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you ever see the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , the <unk> that are doing a different kind of <unk> , <unk> it <unk> it .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . <unk> &apos;t creates a <unk> of the <unk> ; it creates the <unk> of the reality of the reality of the reality of the <unk> .
I often talk to my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> the man who <unk> the <unk> was in the <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> to my <unk> , you can &apos;t tell these <unk> , because if you &apos;re done , you can &apos;t tell anybody to be <unk> . <unk> can &apos;t be <unk> <unk> because they &apos;re <unk> by a <unk> that is , of course , in the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
You can <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now , this is the <unk> that are <unk> in this <unk> are <unk> of the <unk> , the same kind of necessary to <unk> the <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of plants , like these <unk> <unk> <unk> two <unk> don &apos;t similar , but that if they <unk> in this way , they create a <unk> version that &apos;s <unk> to <unk> .
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you go to the <unk> , we &apos;ll be , &quot; <unk> us &quot; plants . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If you ask them how do you <unk> their <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , you don &apos;t know everything ? &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
The solution is : you take the <unk> <unk> in a full of moon and <unk> with a different <unk> .
With that , it &apos;s not going to be <unk> , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , <unk> the problem is that the ones that have to the <unk> <unk> <unk> , but somehow <unk> to the history of the history of our real world , and it <unk> to the history of our real world , and it <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk> , but rather the <unk> was where we were <unk> and we <unk> or <unk> <unk> the <unk> of mass <unk> of <unk> diversity and <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> diversity and <unk> the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a new possibility for life .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> don &apos;t have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> like <unk> don &apos;t <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It &apos;s the power .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you look at the world , you &apos;ll see that these are not <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of the existence of the <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that has lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> , where you can see the <unk> from the <unk> that seems to be <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> .
If we <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the <unk> <unk> of the political <unk> .
As the <unk> , the <unk> of a <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> to the <unk> level , but <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> &apos;s <unk> &apos;s life , not only is <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because of the development of <unk> development .
And you can &apos;t understand the <unk> <unk> until it comes out of the <unk> .
I <unk> miles from <unk> into China through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only get to <unk> , I realized what &apos;s behind the <unk> that I &apos;m going to talk about .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> at the <unk> <unk> .
That means that it &apos;s been <unk> to the <unk> of Chinese times of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that led to the <unk> <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and her <unk> was <unk> .
It was taken by <unk> in <unk> to the age of two <unk> under his <unk> because he couldn &apos;t live without living him .
The <unk> , which has done the same , it was <unk> in <unk> .
One day she <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for this <unk> , was <unk> to work for seven years .
The pain of the <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of <unk> is from <unk> present .
<unk> , all of that , all of the time , all of that .
Are we going to live in the <unk> world or we want to <unk> the <unk> world of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died said that his greatest fear was that , in our <unk> <unk> of the world , not only <unk> the entire <unk> of the human imagination , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination , to a <unk> <unk> of thinking , but one day we <unk> us from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it &apos;s <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , which has given us <unk> to the <unk> , which made us <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , by creating the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has a 300 years old .
That <unk> history doesn &apos;t <unk> me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we could <unk> in the <unk> .
When these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it is human , <unk> with <unk> <unk> different <unk> .
And that &apos;s in these answers that we all have the chance of being what we are is , a <unk> species , which has to <unk> that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are big moments of <unk> .
I took this picture on the <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> me , and this man , <unk> me , <unk> the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The government wasn &apos;t always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> to <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> them .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
The family , <unk> for his life , <unk> away all of the <unk> , and all of his <unk> .
You know , you know , <unk> don &apos;t <unk> the cold , <unk> it .
The <unk> <unk> were made of <unk> fish in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn &apos;t <unk> from the night or the <unk> <unk> .
It <unk> away , it <unk> the <unk> <unk> in the skin of <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did <unk> , I <unk> them up , she <unk> them by , she <unk> them by , she <unk> them by , she <unk> her a <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk> , she <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> has created a <unk> , and he <unk> another dog and he &apos;s <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> I &apos;m talking about <unk> ? &#91; <unk> &#93; And this , in different ways , &#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> the government <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of an area of <unk> larger <unk> of California and <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s their new <unk> . It &apos;s called <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> at least , at least , who we &apos;ve been in these <unk> areas of the planet , I realize that it doesn &apos;t <unk> at all .
For somebody is home .
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that we <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> . And for all of these children , like the dreams of these kids , become part become a part of the <unk> <unk> of hope .
<unk> , we are <unk> <unk> we are <unk> that <unk> never to anything .
I knew that the <unk> --
<unk> are not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our site is <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public <unk> to <unk> our public places in <unk> of <unk> , from which have seen and , <unk> a time for a <unk> , <unk> <unk> for <unk> , in the <unk> , the world of <unk> diversity , and we have to find a <unk> world , and we need to find a <unk> world and <unk> <unk> .
where <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I &apos;ve written in this book that I hope you &apos;ve heard about some <unk> , in case you don &apos;t <unk> them .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> : &quot; If we want to <unk> <unk> of our citizens . &quot; The way to do it is to <unk> freedom <unk> . &quot;
The reason , it &apos;s <unk> , in the fact that freedom is itself a value , is <unk> , <unk> , for human beings .
<unk> else is <unk> in the fact that if we &apos;re <unk> , each of us can act on its own , without any <unk> that we &apos;re going to <unk> our <unk> , without no one <unk> in the name .
The way to <unk> freedom is to <unk> the choice .
More choices , people have , more <unk> are <unk> , and more of them is <unk> .
This is , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in society that no one <unk> of <unk> in <unk> .
And it &apos;s also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I &apos;ll show you some examples of what progress has made it possible .
This is my <unk> . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to give me a simple note about the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> that you can buy to the number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that nobody is in your <unk> <unk> that nobody <unk> already , in your <unk> .
That &apos;s what <unk> is .
Then you go to the <unk> store for buy a <unk> : <unk> , radio , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there &apos;s a big number of <unk> <unk> .
We can do six and a half million different <unk> using <unk> that there are in one just store .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> .
<unk> fields : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the <unk> services , <unk> <unk> , to <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , you don &apos;t <unk> it .
A <unk> of that , by the way , was that the phone call never <unk> .
These days they went .
We have a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , especially in cell phones .
Here &apos;s cell phones .
My <unk> is in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
If you haven &apos;t seen that in the house , in the house , you &apos;re very <unk> , and you &apos;re very soon going to get there .
And what happens at the end is that people <unk> in the <unk> and ask this question . And you know what the answer is ? The answer is &quot; &quot; &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : It doesn &apos;t happen in the United States that you are from the <unk> and the <unk> you have to do .
Instead , <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> says , &quot; OK , we can do A , or <unk> , &quot; A <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> and these <unk> . &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> and these <unk> . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You were like , &quot; <unk> , what do you do ? &quot;
And the <unk> says , &quot; A <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> and <unk> <unk> these <unk> and <unk> . &quot;
&quot; What do you do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; <unk> if you were me , what would you say ? &quot;
And the <unk> , &quot; But I &apos;m not <unk> . &quot;
And the result we call it the &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> that makes it look like a good thing .
But it really doesn &apos;t really have a weight and <unk> the responsibility for a <unk> decisions that something is knows something , <unk> , to <unk> else that doesn &apos;t know -- and it &apos;s <unk> -- and it &apos;s certainly not in the <unk> <unk> , and therefore , it &apos;s not in the <unk> <unk> to make decisions : the patient .
There &apos;s a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me and you , that if you think about it , it doesn &apos;t make any sense , because we can &apos;t <unk> .
But if we can &apos;t <unk> , why are we going to <unk> them ?
The answer is , they want to <unk> , we call the <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of this <unk> as a <unk> of <unk> is a question of choice , how you see in this <unk> . &quot; We don &apos;t want to <unk> kids . We want to be no longer <unk> . We don &apos;t want to <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times they do .
That means that every <unk> , at <unk> , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
<unk> to the family and <unk> , a time perspective , the common perspective , <unk> for anybody , was that you were able to get the <unk> as possible .
The only one real choice was with who , not when , and what to do after that .
<unk> , all of it is really to play .
They &apos;re going to be very smart students , and they <unk> their 20 percent <unk> .
And not because they &apos;re not <unk> , not because they &apos;re <unk> .
but why I &apos;m <unk> , I &apos;m <unk> to say , &quot; <unk> <unk> or not ? <unk> do it now ? &quot;
&quot; Are you going to think before the kids or <unk> ? &quot;
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this <unk> doesn &apos;t <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and get a <unk> to my <unk> .
And they really have to do that . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the work is : we &apos;re <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> , because the technology allows us to work every day , from every corner of the planet , <unk> that from the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> , and I won &apos;t say anybody where the <unk> works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What does that incredible <unk> of choice , what do we have about work ? It &apos;s that we have to decide , <unk> at any time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son to play <unk> , with the <unk> in a <unk> , the other , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , on the <unk> .
And even though they &apos;re all <unk> , every minute that we see our <unk> son , <unk> , we &apos;re also <unk> , &quot; Can we tell this call ? &quot;
&quot; I <unk> to <unk> this <unk> ? I &apos;ve got to take this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , that makes the <unk> experience of your child &apos;s very different than that it would be in other conditions .
So , any of you look , little things , little , tiny and big , objects and life , life is a matter of choices .
And once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but not everything was about choice .
The world today is <unk> to this : The <unk> is , &quot; Is it a <unk> thing <unk> , or <unk> ? &quot;
The answer is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the <unk> .
<unk> this <unk> two <unk> effects two people on people .
The first one , <unk> , is that it <unk> instead of <unk> .
With a lot of <unk> between , you get very difficult to do it .
I &apos;ll give you an example , <unk> study on <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> has had access to <unk> data , <unk> society , <unk> <unk> society , with about a million <unk> <unk> in different companies .
What you &apos;ve discovered is that for every 10 of the solutions that are <unk> in more , the <unk> of <unk> two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s 10 percent less than <unk> in <unk> <unk> , <unk> . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> between them , it &apos;s got to decide , and it &apos;s got to <unk> .
And in <unk> , and still in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course <unk> never comes to <unk> .
<unk> that doesn &apos;t just mean that these <unk> are <unk> food for <unk> because they don &apos;t have enough money , they also want to say that the decision is so <unk> that it <unk> also <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re not <unk> , until five <unk> <unk> per year from <unk> labor , which would be well <unk> to <unk> .
So <unk> is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> choices .
And I think it &apos;s going to change the world like this .
&quot; And finally , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
I could just make the right decision , if it &apos;s for the <unk> , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and you <unk> the wrong <unk> .
So that &apos;s the first effect . The second is that even though we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice , at the end is less <unk> by the result of how we <unk> <unk> with less <unk> than what you &apos;ve been doing .
And that for several reasons .
One of these is that with so many <unk> between you and <unk> one and it doesn &apos;t perfect , it &apos;s easy , you can imagine you could have a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> us to <unk> choice and the <unk> <unk> <unk> the decision <unk> from the decision <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> the decision <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> that decision ,
even when it was an <unk> .
The more choices are , it &apos;s easier to <unk> than any <unk> that is <unk> of choice .
<unk> , there &apos;s what <unk> call <unk> .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well known as the value that we give things <unk> from what we <unk> .
You know , when there are lots of <unk> possible , it &apos;s easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and be less <unk> than the <unk> that you have <unk> .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;ll <unk> with all of the people who are not in New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably <unk> .
There &apos;s this <unk> to the <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It &apos;s all for them .
It doesn &apos;t <unk> . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; All my <unk> to <unk> are away . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> right in front of home . &quot;
And it <unk> two weeks <unk> from the idea that it &apos;s <unk> -- every day -- the possibility of <unk> where it wants .
<unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the more of the <unk> we have from <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> us as <unk> .
Here &apos;s another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It &apos;s about living the moment , and maybe the way of living .
But the most important point is that whatever you <unk> , you &apos;re not going to be doing other .
The things that don &apos;t know many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> point : <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk> .
They &apos;re almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were just one like , and <unk> them from <unk> , they were <unk> , only after they were <unk> , and they were <unk> , and they had a lot of times , and they were going to be good .
So , I started to <unk> a couple of the new when the <unk> were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> said , &quot; Do you want to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
I want them to <unk> or <unk> ? &quot; <unk> &quot; or &quot; <unk> &quot;
&quot; Do you want to <unk> it ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> wants to <unk> or <unk> ? &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was <unk> , and after a while I was able to say , &quot; I want the guy -- that was the only kind of -- that was the only kind of , so one . I &apos;m going to <unk> all the <unk> <unk> , then I &apos;ll go out of the store , <unk> , <unk> , and then , with the best of <unk> I would ever had .
It was the <unk> . With all that choice I had <unk> the best .
But I did worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice , my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn &apos;t know anything to do when I was just one like , but when I was 100 different , I was at least one time to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
And then I <unk> that I was <unk> in <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in life of people &apos;s lives not doing the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> themselves .
And that &apos;s less <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of <unk> , it makes it <unk> .
Because if I did it , I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth will be more about this .
&quot; He was better when he was worse , &quot; The reason he was better , when he was worse was worse than <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are at the <unk> .
You never <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> , are <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you &apos;re here is , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; Yes , you want it . &quot;
I mean -- little <unk> moment -- that I &apos;m really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn &apos;t do it better , I didn &apos;t <unk> .
But <unk> isn &apos;t always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> when there &apos;s only that kind of <unk> is that when you &apos;re not <unk> , and I &apos;ll tell you , &quot; Why ? &quot;
Who is <unk> ? &quot; <unk> , &quot; The answer is <unk> .
The world is <unk> . What could I do ?
When there are hundreds of types of <unk> , and you get a <unk> , and you know who is the <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s clear that the <unk> you are .
We could have to do it .
With hundreds of <unk> <unk> , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even though the result , even though the result is <unk> , they get <unk> and they give them the <unk> to them .
In the last few years , the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world .
I think that a <unk> <unk> -- not the only important , but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is that people have experiences because the <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation think that <unk> is .
So the final result is that in general we &apos;re better , <unk> , but it &apos;s worse .
Let me show you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all get for good and it &apos;s completely <unk> . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk> , but it doesn &apos;t <unk> that much choice is better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a <unk> value , <unk> . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m quite sure we &apos;ve <unk> from a piece that level of choices our lives .
Now , from a <unk> point of view -- I almost finished -- from a <unk> point of view , <unk> is <unk> .
What allows all this choice in <unk> society is <unk> .
There are many places in the world , and you have <unk> <unk> , where the problem isn &apos;t that they have <unk> .
The problem is they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> that I &apos;m talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> talked about yesterday about how those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> are <unk> . It &apos;s a money .
I mean these choices , <unk> and <unk> , not that they are just <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
They make us worse .
If some of what we do in our society allows for us to be <unk> in those where people have too much chance , not only their lives to <unk> but also our <unk> .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income is doing good at all -- not just to the poor -- not just to the poor people -- it &apos;s because of the <unk> <unk> .
So to <unk> , &quot; <unk> , you can become everything you want to ...
<unk> , people of culture , <unk> , &quot; What are you going to do that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s <unk> that you can &apos;t do anything in a glass <unk> . &quot;
&quot; A <unk> imagination , a <unk> view of the world --
and <unk> I <unk> it , and I <unk> it , at the beginning .
But then , I realized that fish knows the long one .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you <unk> in <unk> , so that &quot; everything is possible . &quot; You know , &quot; You can &quot; <unk> the <unk> . &quot;
If you <unk> the <unk> so that you can <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They all need a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
