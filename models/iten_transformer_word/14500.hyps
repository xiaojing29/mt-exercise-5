<unk> year I showed these <unk> <unk> <unk> , which was about three million years was <unk> the United States , was <unk> the <unk> of the United States , <unk> , is <unk> of 40 percent .
I &apos;m going to <unk> this <unk> of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is , in some sense , the heart <unk> of climate system .
It <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You can see , it <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That &apos;s the ice in <unk> , which <unk> <unk> summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , five years old , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> the <unk> here from the body .
<unk> years is <unk> by this way ,
This is a problem because the <unk> is <unk> <unk> around the ocean <unk> where there are huge <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , that <unk> could <unk> , that <unk> could <unk> , <unk> this point of not <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is already <unk> from the water .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : She &apos;s good . The question is if we <unk> it .
One reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> from the north .
This is a river <unk> <unk> .
<unk> had never <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> river , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , here is where we <unk> the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> other side of the planet : <unk> , the largest <unk> <unk> of the planet .
<unk> month scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of ice is in <unk> , and that the <unk> <unk> , which <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> feet of the <unk> , like <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the largest <unk> <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which few years ago were <unk> .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : this <unk> is the source of the <unk> water <unk> this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same thing happens to <unk> water .
In California <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> of 40 percent .
<unk> <unk> are in crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they &apos;re <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and without <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years , <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> .
If you look at the <unk> context , you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we &apos;ve <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every day .
Look at the area of the <unk> <unk> , from <unk> , to <unk> , and on both <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , where there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean .
The biggest <unk> of global warming , together to the <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions , together .
And you &apos;re going to build a lot of other <unk> .
But we &apos;re <unk> to a <unk> of direction .
These are the <unk> projects over the last few years and some <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there &apos;s a political <unk> in our country .
<unk> <unk> and oil have <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I <unk> image something --
<unk> <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it on the <unk> .
This is the second largest flow flow in America .
It &apos;s happened around <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> is a <unk> and happy and <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
<unk> is more <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : From here , it &apos;s a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
The largest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- not know what they &apos;re talking about .
<unk> : So <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , one part .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> , we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make <unk> and <unk> the truth about <unk> .
It &apos;s actually not <unk> .
We think it &apos;s <unk> -- it &apos;s also a good <unk> .
So we don &apos;t know about climate change .
We &apos;re going to do that .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you &apos;ve heard about it a lot .
So , we &apos;re going to <unk> a <unk> <unk> structure .
<unk> ! <unk> are a little <unk> , but that &apos;s the sound of <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> is between the main <unk> of global <unk> , but <unk> technology <unk> that you see is changing everything .
<unk> a look at this : this is the <unk> <unk> technology .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic <unk> and the <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> is <unk> in crisis ; America &apos;s <unk> , <unk> crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all of the <unk> : our <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> <unk> and oil <unk> .
Now , but there &apos;s a new <unk> , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan to <unk> America to work , <unk> more <unk> , and help <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we can solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
<unk> : This is the last .
<unk> : It &apos;s about <unk> energy .
One of the most <unk> ways to <unk> the <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , a new network .
<unk> <unk> two : <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> jobs .
<unk> : <unk> America . It &apos;s time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A <unk> <unk> <unk> says , &quot; If you want to go to the <unk> , go by alone .
If you want to go away , you go together . &quot;
We have to go far away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED I made a <unk> on <unk> .
And I &apos;m trying to <unk> about how the car works .
So I &apos;m going to go there . And for those that the other time there were no longer , the <unk> is the largest experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were <unk> less than a <unk> <unk> from the beginning of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second .
That &apos;s just <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk> .
That &apos;s what I work . It &apos;s called <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> <unk> feet . And it &apos;s <unk> feet .
This is an <unk> image of <unk> in construction . So you can see the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> last year we <unk> the car for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was because of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s an image of the first <unk> of particles that had done everything about the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles in the <unk> .
In other words , when I <unk> that image the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is a big <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if that was this <unk> <unk> , when someone <unk> on Google and <unk> that the <unk> page was this .
That means we have had a <unk> impact on the scientific <unk> .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the car , had to just these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> of <unk> .
Now , the <unk> of you <unk> <unk> and <unk> , &quot; It &apos;s not true . It &apos;s <unk> too <unk> . &quot;
And they can do it because when they &apos;re very <unk> , they become the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , <unk> <unk> degrees <unk> , at the temperature <unk> to the space of stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> between the <unk> <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
That was the result .
Now , this is more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and that are <unk> about 30 <unk> .
It &apos;s about 50 <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
Now they &apos;re <unk> now <unk> all of their place .
<unk> the end of <unk> is going to be new <unk> .
<unk> it , and we <unk> it to get data or <unk> , and continue so our <unk> to find out what the <unk> are <unk> that <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> <unk> the value of science and engineering <unk> . It &apos;s easy to <unk> .
I think that &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s the fact that I think is the value of things like <unk> .
I &apos;d like to <unk> with the words of a <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> <unk> of <unk> experiments of <unk> experiments , his <unk> was Michael <unk> , said , &quot; No is <unk> progress for human mind how the science <unk> how the ideas are <unk> to be <unk> , and that there are not <unk> in nature , which our <unk> are <unk> , and that there are not <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to <unk> when , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> as <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , actually thinking and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that they <unk> most of the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects , together to my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started <unk> , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having a computer , instead of having the <unk> of the <unk> as a digital <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> with the hands ,
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that we <unk> to explore the answer , building <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , they can <unk> <unk> with their own <unk> , and they have a screen and <unk> .
But <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> <unk> .
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> the digital information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement , and <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , the other , how we can explore them , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> with just some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> <unk> to show the video : if we <unk> it in a direction , the <unk> <unk> . So if we <unk> on the other side .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , they <unk> what they &apos;re going to do .
If they <unk> , they <unk> it and they can <unk> it a little bit .
If they <unk> , they <unk> it and they can <unk> it a little bit .
They also <unk> their <unk> and <unk> .
We then <unk> that one of the <unk> of the <unk> was the <unk> that we can use common <unk> about data , like , &quot; <unk> &quot; a color &quot; <unk> &quot; a color &quot; <unk> &quot;
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I can <unk> it to <unk> the color in the central <unk> , where you get <unk> .
and I can <unk> it to <unk> the color in the central one , where you <unk> .
It &apos;s too much about it , we can <unk> a little bit .
I &apos;m also <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> , math and <unk> games where people can try things , and <unk> where people can try things , and <unk> the results immediately .
I &apos;m ...
This is a <unk> sequence I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a game of words that is <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , every <unk> <unk> a letter <unk> on every <unk> , <unk> , <unk> every <unk> <unk> a letter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . And as I <unk> <unk> words , he <unk> <unk> on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds <unk> , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> , I made a video game <unk> , I made it , and I <unk> them , and I <unk> a video .
They &apos;re very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things that you have to do is you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just wanted to say , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , right there .
It actually wanted to <unk> <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> building a tool for <unk> <unk> . He &apos;s <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
That &apos;s what the sun is doing .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now , he brought a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> work ! Yes !
So , <unk> <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
-- <unk> their story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with the <unk> , and it can decide how you <unk> .
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with the <unk> , and it can decide how you <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time to show you is a <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> , to <unk> and <unk> music .
It &apos;s a <unk> tool , <unk> recently , to <unk> music .
<unk> <unk> here <unk> from <unk> like <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of these four <unk> <unk> , and you can choose what you can use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of <unk> <unk> .
And we just <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually , you can control from alive , like <unk> and <unk> .
I <unk> it to a particular <unk> and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are the <unk> effects of time and <unk> , which <unk> to the whole sequence .
<unk> how it works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m going to <unk> a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : And now I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> , so I can control the effect from alive .
<unk> : I can <unk> the whole sequence of time from one side or the other .
<unk> : <unk> : And now <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : I can <unk> the sequence of flight .
So I don &apos;t have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> on the left the left the <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new <unk> <unk> more and more <unk> to how our brain works and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of this <unk> of this path , and some possibilities we try to bring out of this .
The concept that I want to <unk> is that it &apos;s <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> <unk> , which <unk> information in our way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time of talking to you all .
I &apos;m a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and <unk> of my life .
And I don &apos;t look what it can change .
But , I said this , something particular happened in my life and in my career , which <unk> me to <unk> the whole relationship with this job .
The particular thing is I wrote this book , this <unk> called &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which , <unk> from my books , to some reason for some reason , I &apos;m right to <unk> a big <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere I &apos;m <unk> now , people <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I &apos;m going to come to me and say , &quot; Don &apos;t you fear no fear of you not <unk> to do better ?
You don &apos;t have fear to be writing for the whole life without being able to create a book that can <unk> someone to do a book that can <unk> someone ? &quot;
How can you get someone to do ? &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , and I remember that over 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a <unk> -- which I wanted to be a <unk> .
We &apos;re going to <unk> the same <unk> from fear .
And people say , &quot; Don &apos;t <unk> to be <unk> . &quot;
<unk> &apos;t you <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> you ?
You don &apos;t fear of this <unk> for the whole life without nothing to get out and die on a <unk> of dreams <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> dreams with the <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I <unk> of all those things .
I always <unk> .
And I have fear of many other things that people can &apos;t <unk> .
As <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as I think about it , and I thought about it is why ?
<unk> ?
It &apos;s <unk> that anyone who <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel to do .
But what &apos;s how do you get in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not do ?
How did my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I don &apos;t remember one time in his 40 years of activity in which he was asked if she were <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
It never was -- that <unk> of <unk> John , like <unk> ?
Don &apos;t we do it , <unk> ?
<unk> , the engineers like a group didn &apos;t certainly have , in <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
We have enough , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> but <unk> of all kinds , we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk> .
And I &apos;m not going to look at the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often for them .
And the ones that don &apos;t seem to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before I die , in the last <unk> said , &quot; Every my book <unk> <unk> me a little more <unk> . &quot; A <unk> <unk> <unk> about work of their life .
But we don &apos;t know about <unk> , when we <unk> this , because we &apos;ve heard these things so long , we have <unk> <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are <unk> in some way . And the art , eventually , <unk> always <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> you all over here today is : <unk> you have this idea ?
It &apos;s OK , I &apos;m going to <unk> from a <unk> <unk> to me not .
I think it &apos;s <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s also <unk> and I don &apos;t want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better <unk> our <unk> <unk> to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- I would be very <unk> to start <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> the <unk> in my career .
<unk> -- look at it &apos;s pretty young , I have about 40 years old .
I &apos;ve still about four <unk> of work .
And it &apos;s very <unk> that whatever you &apos;re going to have now <unk> from the world as the work that <unk> after the <unk> of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we &apos;re all <unk> friends here -- is <unk> that my biggest <unk> is my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> , thinking .
You know , that &apos;s the kind of thought that <unk> <unk> person to start <unk> <unk> at nine <unk> . And I don &apos;t want to do it .
I continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so , it looks like , after many <unk> , which the way to work to continue to write is to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to have a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , which I &apos;m <unk> , and the natural <unk> about what <unk> wrote about what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . And as I <unk> for all last year , how to look through time , trying to find other societies , and more <unk> .
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that <unk> me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s because it <unk> and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don &apos;t believe that creativity <unk> <unk> from men , OK ?
It <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> from a few <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for the reasons and <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
The <unk> were the same idea , but they <unk> that sort of the spirit without a <unk> .
which is <unk> , because the <unk> didn &apos;t really understand that a <unk> was particularly smart .
I thought that a <unk> was this <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally <unk> in the <unk> of the study of a artist , a little <unk> like <unk> <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> of that work .
<unk> <unk> is the distance of the <unk> I talk -- that <unk> <unk> you from the results of your work .
And everybody <unk> was so <unk> , right ?
So the artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like , for example , too much <unk> , right ?
If your work was <unk> <unk> , you &apos;re not going to <unk> the <unk> , you all know , you &apos;d have been <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it was not all <unk> , right ?
<unk> , everybody was <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and everything , and we <unk> this big idea ; we put this big idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe , and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and no longer to the <unk> creatures that <unk> from the <unk> .
This was the <unk> principle and people tend to think that creativity was completely <unk> by the <unk> .
And for the first time in history , <unk> <unk> to <unk> this , or the artist as a <unk> <unk> that person with a <unk> rather than <unk> .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think I &apos;m going to try and believe that I think of being a <unk> as a source , the <unk> and the <unk> of all <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> is a responsibility to be too big to give us human <unk> .
It &apos;s like to ask someone to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in <unk> 500 years .
And , if that &apos;s true , and I think that &apos;s the question becomes , the question becomes , and I think it &apos;s now .
Can we do it <unk> ?
<unk> come back to a more <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can &apos;t <unk> 500 years of thinking about this in a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you <unk> to <unk> .
It probably doesn &apos;t <unk> you all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to tell you is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t we <unk> this way ?
Because more sense of everything that I &apos;ve ever heard about to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process .
A process that , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- knows , you don &apos;t <unk> <unk> .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seem <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s now 90 years , but that was a <unk> for all life and said that during the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> , and I <unk> it in the fields , and I <unk> it , within the <unk> .
He said he was like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And she <unk> to her from the <unk> .
I <unk> it to get it , because it <unk> the land under its feet .
I decided to have one thing to do , and it was to do that , words , &quot; <unk> <unk> as a <unk> . &quot;
And so he went home and he was <unk> by this <unk> , and he didn &apos;t have to get another <unk> <unk> and a <unk> <unk> enough <unk> from it , and <unk> it on the page .
<unk> times it doesn &apos;t <unk> to be enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without getting to get to home and <unk> and <unk> <unk> it through the <unk> and she would <unk> <unk> through the <unk> , looking for , like she said , &quot; another <unk> . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this piece never <unk> -- there were times when the <unk> was about , right ?
So , he was <unk> at home and he was trying to <unk> and <unk> the <unk> through , and he <unk> a <unk> right in the while he was <unk> , and he said , he was like , and he was like if you <unk> with the other hand and <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and <unk> into his body and <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the page <unk> and <unk> , but the <unk> , the <unk> , the word to the <unk> .
So when I <unk> him -- it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not all my <unk> process -- I &apos;m not a <unk> .
I &apos;m a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is , I <unk> every day and <unk> and work and work and <unk> <unk> <unk> over the <unk> .
But even I have <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I think that I &apos;m also going to have to be <unk> .
You know , even though the work and the ideas <unk> me to be <unk> by a certain source I could not <unk> <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it to it in a way to <unk> it , but rather , <unk> it <unk> us to <unk> it ?
<unk> , I &apos;m going to talk about , the best example I have <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;ve been <unk> <unk> for a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the artist <unk> <unk> , trying to control , <unk> , <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , <unk> , and one day was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> it all for him .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> , which comes in in his head as <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , you know , you &apos;re <unk> , and the <unk> , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the <unk> , you know , but it doesn &apos;t know how to <unk> .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
So , it starts to feel this kind of old <unk> <unk> in him , &quot; I &apos;m going to <unk> it from this <unk> song .
I &apos;m not <unk> enough and I can &apos;t <unk> . &quot;
And instead of going to <unk> , <unk> .
It <unk> the whole process and made something completely new .
<unk> simply the sky and said , &quot; <unk> , you don &apos;t see that I &apos;m <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> it looks like a song . &quot;
If you really want to <unk> , I &apos;m going to <unk> you , you know , you know , you know , you know , if you really want to <unk> you .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And his <unk> process after this .
It wasn &apos;t working , it was still <unk> as always as a <unk> .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that was <unk> <unk> <unk> , when <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which was <unk> <unk> , and <unk> it back from where it was , I was , <unk> that it wasn &apos;t had to be <unk> and <unk> .
but I <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> <unk> a conversation with this <unk> and this thing that was <unk> and <unk> that it was not <unk> .
So how much I &apos;m going to change that story to change a little bit , and I &apos;m going to tell you once .
This idea , I was <unk> when I was <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> in one of those <unk> <unk> in which we &apos;re working in and we &apos;re not going to be a <unk> , which is going to be the <unk> book .
Not only <unk> , just the <unk> book .
And I started thinking about this project .
But then I &apos;m <unk> to <unk> that <unk> and <unk> us .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I said a high <unk> , &quot; <unk> , what , both of them , and we don &apos;t have to be <unk> <unk> , no ?
Because as you see I &apos;m <unk> all I have , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , I don &apos;t know .
I started writing the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to please be <unk> that I &apos;m <unk> to do my own . &quot; Because -- at the end is , OK -- I &apos;m going to do it in the <unk> Africa , people <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> . And the <unk> of the moon , <unk> and the music <unk> that I <unk> for hours and <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every <unk> , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these artists actually <unk> .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you &apos;ve all seen , at some point , a <unk> like this .
It was like time , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it was not doing anything different from the usually , like <unk> <unk> <unk> before , but it was <unk> .
And suddenly , it doesn &apos;t just <unk> like a human .
But it <unk> up from <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , the <unk> with the name .
<unk> your hands and <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , &quot; God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- when <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; which you can still feel in <unk> or <unk> .
In <unk> , when a artist did something impossible and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> -- one <unk> of God .
And it &apos;s <unk> because we need .
But the problem comes the day , the <unk> , when you <unk> and <unk> and <unk> that are the 11 of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> God no longer is .
It &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and maybe it &apos;s not going to be more <unk> to the <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God , while <unk> , and what &apos;s going to do with the rest of your life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so <unk> if you can &apos;t believe , <unk> , <unk> the most <unk> <unk> of your being come from yourself .
But I just <unk> you data from a <unk> of this <unk> <unk> of this <unk> part of your life you have to go to <unk> when you &apos;re finished .
And , you know , if we think about this way , it &apos;s going to change .
And so I started <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> like I <unk> it for several months in the book that was <unk> soon , <unk> of my <unk> .
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , I don &apos;t have fear .
Don &apos;t <unk> . You just don &apos;t just <unk> your work .
<unk> <unk> for your <unk> , whatever it can be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , you &apos;re going to <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , and just <unk> it , &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
<unk> , you do the same <unk> .
And I said , &quot; <unk> ! &quot; <unk> .
I think and I think I &apos;m <unk> <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects about what can <unk> and discovery about what it can <unk> and discovery of new <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re now <unk> a new <unk> <unk> : we started <unk> biology and now starting to <unk> the biology and now <unk> that digital code of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We always tried to <unk> big questions .
&quot; <unk> is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that I think they have to understand how many <unk> I think they have <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> for about 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome that we <unk> from the world &apos;s <unk> of biology to the digital world of the computer .
Now , <unk> : Can we <unk> life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> genome from the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> a little more small .
We &apos;re able to <unk> a <unk> of <unk> <unk> that are here .
But when we take a look at the map , it &apos;s just <unk> than our .
<unk> , that &apos;s simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at a time , it &apos;s very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell .
So , I thought the only way to <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> this <unk> <unk> to <unk> some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of &quot; <unk> . &quot; Can we <unk> a <unk> ? &quot;
Can the chemistry <unk> to produce these molecules that we never have been able to create these big molecules that we never have been doing before ?
And , in <unk> case , can we make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> with which we are able to <unk> life is <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the <unk> code , instead , <unk> rather slowly , but it &apos;s <unk> .
And our most <unk> results can get on a <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve been <unk> more than 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> many <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before the experiments .
But we found that we &apos;re <unk> DNA is very hard .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> and it &apos;s a <unk> process : the more <unk> is a <unk> process . The more <unk> is .
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , <unk> by information <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a small virus that <unk> bacteria .
We designed <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA <unk> about <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part of it is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> it in bacteria , bacteria have <unk> this <unk> and <unk> the <unk> particles .
<unk> particles have been <unk> by cells , they &apos;re <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I talked about recently with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that they have certainly <unk> this model .
They have more <unk> than you .
<unk> that &apos;s a situation where the software can actually build its own <unk> <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we &apos;re going to do the bigger things .
It <unk> building the entire <unk> of <unk> .
They are more <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we thought about <unk> <unk> <unk> , so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> are the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if we <unk> information <unk> into a computer , these are these very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> the <unk> was a <unk> <unk> for every 10 <unk> .
We found , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If we were <unk> that original sequence never <unk> states .
One part of the process is to design <unk> <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> <unk> <unk> to build more <unk> than <unk> .
<unk> elements are <unk> here .
You probably read that you have read that <unk> <unk> .
So , we have a <unk> code that <unk> on four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> and <unk>
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , and there &apos;s a <unk> order of <unk> for every <unk> .
So we can use the <unk> code for writing , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did we do at the beginning was <unk> .
Some were <unk> by the fact that it was not <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Anyway , we made these <unk> <unk> <unk> , so that we &apos;re <unk> to create a extremely <unk> <unk> <unk> as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to <unk> the process .
So , that looks like the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When we start these <unk> <unk> , more than 100 <unk> <unk> , no longer we &apos;re <unk> directly <unk> to the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we have <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA to <unk> DNA .
Here &apos;s an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> -- it &apos;s been <unk> <unk> as it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely <unk> .
You can live under <unk> .
It &apos;s absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and they <unk> to find new <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , NASA <unk> showed that this is .
This is a picture of the <unk> we built these <unk> , just using <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This image not been <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we &apos;ve done a little time ago .
They are more <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s the largest <unk> <unk> structure ever <unk> from man .
It has a <unk> <unk> <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> <unk> <unk> , we <unk> <unk> pages to <unk> this <unk> code .
Now , how do we do it work ?
<unk> , of course , through a virus is a <unk> game .
It &apos;s a little bit more <unk> when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s more simple when it &apos;s about <unk> cells like our : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is the <unk> process .
In <unk> , the <unk> is instead of <unk> the cell , but we have <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re able to do a <unk> <unk> from one cell to another and <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> species .
<unk> are different how men are <unk> .
We &apos;ve <unk> some <unk> more <unk> in a way that you could decide what to choose to do .
He then <unk> it <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> is gone into the cell .
And I &apos;m <unk> that we don &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to <unk> more in there .
This is one of the biggest <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere , you know , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> <unk> to that species .
So who think of evolution as a <unk> <unk> at the time you <unk> doesn &apos;t have much of biology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell that was in the cell .
The <unk> <unk> we <unk> it .
It &apos;s <unk> , and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> it , and we <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk> .
It &apos;s become blue because of the genes that we <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species are <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> about all of a new species , <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , and the <unk> are <unk> , and when we <unk> the code <unk> exactly what we &apos;ve <unk> .
Now , this may seem <unk> <unk> , but we can <unk> the software DNA <unk> , we can change things in a pretty <unk> .
Now , I &apos;ve already <unk> that here is not about <unk> -- but <unk> progress from three million years and a half million years and a half million years and a half million years of evolution . And I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create new species on this <unk> .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We &apos;re going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give you an example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> ; 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re <unk> to find <unk> food , <unk> water and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> for six billion people .
We &apos;re even more <unk> to do it for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> .
That means 100 million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or whatever <unk> <unk> process , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
In more we have to realize that all the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> into the atmosphere .
At the day today , because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> around the world , we have a <unk> about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry only <unk> <unk> <unk> , and think about how many things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here are <unk> data from reality and our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , thank you very much , <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think of these 20 million genes or <unk> , or <unk> to try to <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology <unk> .
And it &apos;s just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> , chemistry or chemistry , chemistry or <unk> production , <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we &apos;re working on to be able to <unk> and design species .
Well , we don &apos;t know how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly what their <unk> code .
Now we &apos;re <unk> about <unk> <unk> .
You saw you that <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> to <unk> more <unk> than the <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would <unk> <unk> the CO2 in the first one that we &apos;re working on for cells , and we think we can get this purpose to be <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> solar <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> of <unk> around the world , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> we <unk> in <unk> .
We &apos;re going to <unk> feet deep to the temperature <unk> of the water .
<unk> <unk> by the CO2 <unk> .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2 , which can easily be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , <unk> we might think that we could be able to <unk> what the question of the basic question . &quot; What is life . &quot; We have the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole industry .
<unk> . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t it from TED , where you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t do it from TED , you can &apos;t .
We &apos;re going to have a <unk> of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working on to use the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk> .
You saw this year with the flu , we always went back and a dollar <unk> <unk> when it comes to find the <unk> <unk> .
I think that you can change building <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
That &apos;s how the future might start to look at <unk> , now , the <unk> of evolution , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and finally <unk> .
We &apos;re so <unk> to <unk> people .
Our purpose is to do a long enough to try to <unk> it . Thank you very much .
<unk> I &apos;m going to show you , the <unk> possible , some fundamental <unk> , some fundamental <unk> , the new technology that we took to <unk> <unk> <unk> , almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
It &apos;s a environment where you can <unk> is at local level that you can <unk> it with a huge amount of <unk> data .
We &apos;re seeing here <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> images like this .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much the amount of information that we see , how big they are these <unk> <unk> data or images .
Most of the <unk> are common photographs , but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that <unk> <unk> <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in any moment . It &apos;s also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , which is not of images .
This is the <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> .
To <unk> it &apos;s just text and not images , we can do something like that , to make something of the kind of <unk> to see that it &apos;s a real <unk> <unk> .
It could be a little bit <unk> to read a book .
I don &apos;t <unk> it .
This is an example of the <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> number .
Every big image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the <unk> and the beautiful experience of <unk> <unk> or a <unk> <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> <unk> .
We also did something with the corner of the <unk> of this particular number of The <unk> .
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much more than the one that you use in a normal <unk> and we <unk> the content .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see it here .
Or even the <unk> <unk> .
And that really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the space on the screen .
We think that this <unk> <unk> <unk> and other <unk> <unk> , not <unk> more <unk> .
Of course , <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say we have <unk> <unk> to give in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> over the United States .
So now I &apos;m going to start something else .
This is actually alive from the Web ; you can start to see .
It &apos;s a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> student of Washington , with the help of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s alive on the Web , <unk> <unk> .
You can see when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from an image to the other and have this <unk> experience .
But the <unk> <unk> of images here actually has a meaning .
So , the <unk> of the computer <unk> have <unk> these images together , so that we <unk> to <unk> places where <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> . So you see some elements of a <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> , and these things have been <unk> . And so you see some elements of a <unk> <unk> or <unk> , and these things have been <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> data , and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that we &apos;ve done for the first summer <unk> to show you what &apos;s really the key behind this technology , <unk> . And the technology is really <unk> . And it &apos;s not <unk> so much <unk> . It &apos;s not <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s not <unk> <unk> .
We had to <unk> <unk> and so forth .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> . And so on . And you &apos;re going to <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> an image .
So I &apos;ve been <unk> by <unk> and have been all <unk> at the level of this way .
And it &apos;s possible to <unk> this way .
You know , I would never have thought about work to work .
It &apos;s very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think I &apos;m going to see that it &apos;s a lot of different kinds of <unk> : that &apos;s cell phones to <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I <unk> to look at those <unk> .
A lot of <unk> , etc .
<unk> there &apos;s a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from <unk> to the physics of this environment .
The <unk> point is that we can do things with the social environment . This is now <unk> data from the whole memory <unk> of how the Earth <unk> from the whole <unk> of how the Earth the data <unk> , from the <unk> view and <unk> all those data together .
All those pictures become <unk> together , the <unk> of the <unk> of the parts .
You have a <unk> of the Earth <unk> .
Think about this as the <unk> of <unk> <unk> on Earth &apos;s <unk> .
It &apos;s something that <unk> in complexity , as people <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people .
If someone &apos;s a <unk> idea of <unk> all of these <unk> <unk> , my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I can use the <unk> to <unk> in that space , in that <unk> , using the <unk> of anyone , and to have an <unk> social <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all that are extremely <unk> <unk> of every part of the land , <unk> not only from <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
Chris Anderson : I realized what your software is going to <unk> us to do is that at some point in the next few years , all the <unk> were <unk> by anyone in the world , all of the <unk> are <unk> <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yes . What &apos;s doing is it <unk> is to discover .
It &apos;s creating <unk> , if you want , in images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the content of images .
And the thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> information that many of these <unk> images .
As you get a <unk> <unk> <unk> and the text on the Web , you <unk> a <unk> and the text page has a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture <unk> <unk> to all your <unk> ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> <unk> that <unk> is really huge . It &apos;s a <unk> effect .
CA : <unk> , it &apos;s really incredible . <unk> .
<unk> : I &apos;m going to <unk> you a lot .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> of the <unk> research is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of the plants .
<unk> to think that <unk> <unk> still beyond the <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> still the <unk> of the <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , and the idea that we live in there is no reality , but it &apos;s just a model , but it &apos;s just a model of reality ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> did , good , <unk> , many <unk> does .
And , of course , all <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> . <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
We have to <unk> the <unk> of death , so we don &apos;t know if we <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art .
What <unk> is the <unk> of the song , the <unk> of the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> .
He was my <unk> <unk> of journey in <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> &apos;s <unk> , the mother &apos;s <unk> .
All of these <unk> <unk> us that are <unk> <unk> , and other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking about moving in the world .
And , if you <unk> a second , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of the world create a <unk> of <unk> life and <unk> that <unk> the planet and <unk> the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , ideas , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to be from the human imagination , <unk> , <unk> to be <unk> by the human imagination from the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> is the <unk> <unk> of humanity .
It &apos;s the <unk> of what we can be and what we can be as <unk> species .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the <unk> of the <unk> just because it &apos;s <unk> , or -- in the most <unk> -- the <unk> of the diversity -- and you don &apos;t even understand the <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> of the diversity .
The <unk> of that is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just <unk> by a <unk> or a series of rules .
One language is the <unk> of the spirit .
It &apos;s the <unk> with the <unk> of every culture comes in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we &apos;re sitting here at <unk> , at least the <unk> is not <unk> in the <unk> of children .
They &apos;re not <unk> to children , which means less than that they &apos;re not going to be <unk> .
What is more <unk> than the <unk> of being <unk> by the <unk> , of the last to talk about a language , not <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> was the <unk> of someone in some part of the world every two weeks : every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> with it in the <unk> <unk> of a language .
And I know that someone of you <unk> . &quot; <unk> &apos;t it better ?
The world would not be a better place if we all the same language ? &quot; <unk> , then we all talk about it . <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> a <unk> thing that means that we can &apos;t talk about their language .
I &apos;d like to show you a journey through <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we &apos;re <unk> .
Most of us <unk> that when I say , &quot; different ways of <unk> &quot; I really mean , I really think about <unk> .
<unk> for example , this <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> that it &apos;s not able to <unk> the blue color from green , because the <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> of the forest , which <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> <unk> <unk> , you have to <unk> a person talking about a different language .
It &apos;s all <unk> in the past <unk> , though the <unk> is that in these <unk> families , which are talking about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> no one language .
It <unk> to hear and then <unk> to talk .
I was one of the most interesting <unk> that I lived , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> contact with a <unk> <unk> .
They did <unk> by the <unk> photographs that <unk> them in <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> <unk> had never seen anything .
They <unk> the <unk> <unk> , they <unk> the <unk> <unk> , they <unk> to a shape or a <unk> and , they don &apos;t know , they <unk> that they <unk> the <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk> .
But <unk> not only <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> with them .
<unk> percent of the <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We went down to eight <unk> and we found two cases of <unk> . And when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was so that he &apos;s dead <unk> , and then they <unk> the same . And then they <unk> it . It <unk> the same .
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species .
<unk> years old , I was <unk> a really interesting task when my <unk> <unk> <unk> , when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me , if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> between the <unk> society and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
To make sense of <unk> , I should have to understand the <unk> culture and the <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s pretty much about a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Very interesting .
If I &apos;m going to <unk> the big <unk> of the world , what do you get me ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that <unk> Africa doesn &apos;t have <unk> <unk> . And instead , they have no <unk> <unk> . And they <unk> is no other than the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> .
What makes it interesting is the <unk> of the <unk> of life and death .
So <unk> do <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
That &apos;s the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to talk about God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . &quot;
And since you &apos;re <unk> , is the spirit that <unk> you , how do you <unk> ?
So , you start these incredible events : <unk> <unk> in the state of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> rather than the power of the mind when it &apos;s <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> with which I lived the most <unk> <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that once <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> never <unk> been <unk> by <unk> .
Now , <unk> are <unk> by a <unk> , but their <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> by <unk> families , and they live in a world that they have <unk> <unk> and <unk> in a world that was <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
For that time , they are <unk> to the values of their society , <unk> <unk> that <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to the <unk> <unk> .
And the term of this incredible <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> <unk> out and for the first time , at the age of 18 , see a <unk> . And that moment of the first <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk> , all that have learned in <unk> <unk> is about <unk> , everything that they &apos;ve learned in the <unk> . The <unk> <unk> a step back and says .
&quot; <unk> ? <unk> as I said . &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> . Now it &apos;s <unk> .
They &apos;re called <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they say that we are , <unk> <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think about <unk> <unk> and the <unk> environment and the old <unk> history of <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> <unk> in his <unk> , maybe <unk> and say that these <unk> are closer to the Earth .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> , but because of the <unk> of the <unk> , but because of time and <unk> , have created a <unk> of the Earth &apos;s <unk> . But on a <unk> <unk> <unk> : the concept that can only live because it &apos;s <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> .
What does that mean ?
<unk> to say that a <unk> of <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> spirit that <unk> its <unk> is going to be <unk> <unk> human being <unk> <unk> . And it &apos;s a very different relationship with the mountain or that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that a mountain is <unk> to be <unk> .
which is the <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is the <unk> that <unk> <unk> the relationship between <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
That made me a different human being from my friends , <unk> who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> that live north of the world , <unk> that live north <unk> of the world , <unk> that <unk> during the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If we started <unk> that these <unk> can create <unk> , we start to understand some of their <unk> <unk> <unk> . They <unk> this <unk> .
I <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes fascinating is not the potential <unk> is , but the <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> by two elements .
On one hand , this <unk> <unk> <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> <unk> a little <unk> that <unk> a little bit of the <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> of the family <unk> said <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to the <unk> , <unk> .
If you &apos;re going to see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> that are doing a different <unk> of species , <unk> it <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . <unk> &apos;t creates a <unk> of the reality .
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> was <unk> , with his <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , my <unk> cannot be <unk> these <unk> , because if you &apos;re not <unk> , because if you &apos;re not <unk> . <unk> <unk> , but they can &apos;t be <unk> because they &apos;re <unk> by a <unk> that &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s possible to <unk> <unk> if we <unk> with other <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Now , it &apos;s the <unk> that are <unk> in this <unk> are <unk> of <unk> , the same kind of <unk> <unk> . The question <unk> : <unk> <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> species , like these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . But if you <unk> in this way , they make two <unk> <unk> . But if you <unk> in this way , they create <unk> <unk> .
We use the <unk> <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you <unk> to the <unk> , we &apos;re going to <unk> .
What does that mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that our eyes were <unk> in the same species .
If you <unk> it as <unk> their <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , you don &apos;t know everything ? &quot; I said , &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : they take the <unk> <unk> in a night of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> with a different <unk> .
With that you don &apos;t get to <unk> , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , the problem is that the ones of us who have to <unk> <unk> <unk> them , but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of history than our real world &apos;s history than our real world , and <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , <unk> <unk> , not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk> , but rather like the one was where we <unk> and we have <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> the <unk> of mass diversity and <unk> . Now the problem is not the change .
All the <unk> through <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> don &apos;t have <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> <unk> and <unk> like the <unk> don &apos;t have <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It &apos;s the power .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And if you look at the world , you know that these are not <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They are <unk> <unk> and <unk> out of <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that was <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> <unk> in the forest <unk> to a generation ago , and <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where you can see the river <unk> from the <unk> that it looks like <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> .
If we <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the <unk> <unk> of politics .
As <unk> <unk> , <unk> physics of a <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> <unk> , but <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , but the <unk> of <unk> <unk> of a <unk> , not only is not <unk> , but <unk> in certain <unk> , because it &apos;s part of the development .
And you can &apos;t understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you go from the beginning .
I have the <unk> miles from <unk> in the <unk> China through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> with a young <unk> , but only come to <unk> me that I realized what &apos;s behind the <unk> that I &apos;m going to talk about .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> <unk> <unk> .
which means that it was <unk> to the Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk> .
It was taken of <unk> <unk> at age of two <unk> under the <unk> of his <unk> because he couldn &apos;t live without him .
The <unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
One day he <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to work for seven years .
<unk> <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of <unk> is <unk> by <unk> .
<unk> , all <unk> to a choice .
<unk> to live in the world <unk> or <unk> we want to <unk> the <unk> world of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died said that his greatest fear was that , in our <unk> to go to this <unk> <unk> of the world , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination , <unk> to a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it &apos;s <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , who <unk> us to <unk> agriculture , which <unk> us to the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> world has <unk> 300 years .
That <unk> story I didn &apos;t think we have the answers to all the challenges that we <unk> to come .
When the <unk> of the <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
And that &apos;s in these answers that we all <unk> the chance of being what we are : a <unk> species , which has to <unk> that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are large times of <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the north of <unk> island , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> , and this man , <unk> me the story of his <unk> .
The <unk> government didn &apos;t always <unk> with <unk> <unk> and in the &apos; <unk> to <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> for his life , <unk> <unk> all the <unk> , and all of his <unk> .
You know , you know , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> were made of <unk> fish were made of <unk> fish .
The <unk> of this man didn &apos;t <unk> <unk> from night or <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> away , it &apos;s <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> in their hand . When I did it , and I <unk> it in their hand . When I did it , it <unk> it by it , it &apos;s <unk> by it .
It <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog <unk> .
It <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> you talk about <unk> with nothing ?
<unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of an area bigger <unk> than the California and the <unk> <unk> together .
It &apos;s their new <unk> . It &apos;s called <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> all the resources <unk> .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , <unk> , I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> at least at least , who we have been in these <unk> <unk> <unk> of the planet , <unk> that it &apos;s not all <unk> .
For someone is home .
<unk> <unk> of the <unk> of human imagination that <unk> <unk> . And for us all , the dreams of these kids , like dreams of our children , become part of our children , become part of the <unk> of the <unk> .
To end , we <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to anything .
I think the <unk> --
&#91; <unk> &#93; <unk> are not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our website <unk> <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public places to <unk> our public places to <unk> <unk> from how they saw and , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> a time <unk> the central <unk> : the <unk> world &apos;s <unk> to <unk> . And the world &apos;s <unk> to <unk> a <unk> world , and we have to find a <unk> world and <unk> .
where the <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I hope to <unk> other than you &apos;ve heard about and <unk> some <unk> , in case you don &apos;t know .
I want to start with what I call the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all <unk> society <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> : &quot; If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens , &quot; the way to do it is <unk> freedom to <unk> . &quot;
The reason is , from one side , in fact that the freedom is <unk> itself , is <unk> , <unk> for humans .
<unk> is the fact that if we are <unk> , each of us can act to do everything that we <unk> our <unk> , no one <unk> in our name .
The way to <unk> the freedom is <unk> .
<unk> more choices , and more <unk> , and more <unk> is their freedom , the <unk> , the <unk> is their <unk> .
This is , <unk> <unk> so <unk> in society that no one <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made .
That &apos;s my <unk> . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to talk about <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that nobody has already <unk> to you .
That &apos;s what the <unk> is .
Then you go to the <unk> store <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , radio <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there &apos;s a big number of <unk> <unk> .
We can make six and a half million <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one <unk> .
<unk> <unk> there is <unk> choice .
<unk> <unk> : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , you don &apos;t <unk> it .
A <unk> of that , between the other , was that the phone never <unk> .
These days have gone .
We have now <unk> <unk> <unk> , especially between cell phones .
Here &apos;s cell phones .
My <unk> is the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you don &apos;t have yet seen the store under the <unk> , you &apos;re very <unk> .
And what happens is that people <unk> in the <unk> and they do this question . And you know , what &apos;s the answer is ? The answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do anything .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : no longer happens in the United States you &apos;re <unk> from <unk> and <unk> you have to do .
Instead , <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> says , &quot; OK , we can do it . &quot; <unk> , we can do it . &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> these <unk> and these <unk> . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You <unk> them , &quot; <unk> , what do you do ? &quot;
And the <unk> says , &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> these <unk> . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; <unk> if you were me , what <unk> ? &quot;
And the <unk> , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; , &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot;
But actually , it &apos;s not that one <unk> the weight and the responsibility to make decisions from someone who knows about , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> that doesn &apos;t know -- and it &apos;s <unk> -- and it &apos;s not in the <unk> <unk> to make decisions .
There &apos;s a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me and you , that if you think it doesn &apos;t make any sense , because you can &apos;t think about it .
But if we can &apos;t <unk> , why are we <unk> them ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> as a fundamental question is how we &apos;re going to see this <unk> is a question of choice , as you see in this <unk> . &quot; We don &apos;t want to <unk> the kids . They <unk> the <unk> . &quot; We need to <unk> it .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
which means that every <unk> , at <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
<unk> to the family and <unk> , a <unk> time perspective , almost for anybody , was that you <unk> the <unk> as possible , and <unk> to <unk> the <unk> could be possible .
The only one real choice was with who , not when , and even what to do after .
<unk> , it &apos;s really to play .
<unk> students very smart students , and they <unk> them 20 percent less <unk> than a time .
And it &apos;s not because they &apos;re not <unk> , because they &apos;re not <unk> .
but why are I <unk> , I &apos;m <unk> , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; <unk> <unk> or not ? <unk> to do it now ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> later ? I have to think before kids or <unk> ? &quot;
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
And try to answer these questions , even if this <unk> doesn &apos;t <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and get no <unk> to my <unk> .
And they really have to do that . I &apos;m important .
Now , the work : we &apos;re <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because technology <unk> us to work every minute , every day , every corner of the planet , <unk> that from the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> , and I don &apos;t tell anybody what the <unk> works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What does that mean , this incredible choice of choice we have about work ? It &apos;s that we have to decide , <unk> at all time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son to play , with the <unk> in a <unk> , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And even though they &apos;re all <unk> , every minute we see our son <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re also <unk> to do , &quot; I have to answer this call ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> I have to answer this <unk> ? I have to <unk> this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , that &apos;s what &apos;s going to have been doing is very different than what it would be in other conditions .
So , any <unk> , you look , things and big , objects and large and <unk> of life , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but not everything was a question of choice .
The world of today is <unk> to this : The <unk> is , &quot; Is it something <unk> , or <unk> ? &quot;
The answer is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the <unk> .
We &apos;re going to <unk> this choice , two <unk> effects of people .
The first one , <unk> , is that it <unk> instead of <unk> .
With many <unk> between you , it &apos;s very hard to do .
I &apos;ll give you an example of <unk> : a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of my <unk> had access to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> society , with about a million <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> more , the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s 10 percent <unk> in less than it &apos;s <unk> than when they &apos;re only <unk> available . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> <unk> between which <unk> , is it <unk> difficult to decide , and choice <unk> to <unk> .
And <unk> , and still <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and of course , you &apos;re never coming .
<unk> that doesn &apos;t mean just these <unk> <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don &apos;t have enough money , even want to say that the decision is so <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re not <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> to <unk> <unk> for year from <unk> <unk> , which would be well <unk> to <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of having choice .
And I think that <unk> the world like this .
&quot; And to end , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
You have to do the right decision , if it &apos;s for the <unk> , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and you &apos;re going to <unk> the wrong <unk> .
So that &apos;s the first effect . The second is that even though we can <unk> <unk> <unk> and make a choice , at the end of how we have been <unk> with less <unk> by the result of how you have to choose .
And that &apos;s for <unk> .
One of these is that with many <unk> of the <unk> that you choose , if you <unk> one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could make a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> choice , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> the decision <unk> by the decision , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the decision <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
even when it was a <unk> decision .
<unk> there are more choices , there &apos;s more easy to <unk> than the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there &apos;s what <unk> call <unk> .
Dan <unk> <unk> very well , <unk> <unk> , how the value we <unk> things from what we &apos;re <unk> .
You know , when there are many <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m <unk> with all of the ones that are not in New York .
But that &apos;s what it probably <unk> .
There &apos;s this <unk> <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not <unk> . But what he thinks he &apos;s saying , &quot; Well , <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; All my <unk> <unk> are away . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> right in front of home . &quot;
And it &apos;s going to <unk> two weeks from the idea that it &apos;s <unk> -- every day -- the possibility of <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And more of the <unk> that we have <unk> , the more <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It &apos;s about living the moment , and maybe the <unk> of living .
But the most important point is that you &apos;re <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> to not to do other .
The things that they don &apos;t have many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a couple of <unk> .
It &apos;s almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were just one , and <unk> them and <unk> them from <unk> , they were <unk> , only after <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of times , and I &apos;d like to go well .
So , I started <unk> a couple of <unk> when the <unk> were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> said , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
<unk> you want to <unk> or <unk> ? &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
I was <unk> , and after a little bit , I was able to say , &quot; I want the only guy had no idea what it was , so that it was like , for a <unk> . I &apos;m <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , then <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with the best of <unk> I had ever .
It was <unk> . With that I had <unk> the best .
But I &apos;m going to talk about .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that I was worse with all that choice , my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn &apos;t know about <unk> when I was just one guy , but when I was a <unk> <unk> .
What I had <unk> was good , but it &apos;s not perfect .
After I was <unk> to do that I was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in life of people don &apos;t <unk> the <unk> that these have respect to the <unk> of the <unk> .
And that <unk> <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Because if I <unk> it , I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth <unk> to this .
&quot; You were better when you were worse , you know , you were better , when you were worse is when you were worse , you can see <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that the <unk> of the <unk> .
You never have ever <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you &apos;re here is , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; Yes , you want it . &quot;
I mean -- small <unk> moment -- which I &apos;m really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn &apos;t do it , I don &apos;t have any <unk> .
But I don &apos;t always <unk> is a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> when you have only that kind of <unk> is that when you &apos;re not <unk> , and you &apos;re <unk> , &quot; Why ? &quot;
Who &apos;s <unk> ? &quot; The answer is <unk> .
The world is <unk> . What do I could do it do ?
When there are hundreds of <unk> , and I <unk> a <unk> , and I &apos;ll tell you who is the <unk> , it &apos;s clear that the <unk> you are .
<unk> could do better .
With hundreds of <unk> <unk> , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people are <unk> , even if the result is <unk> , they <unk> <unk> and they <unk> the same .
In the last few years , the <unk> <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only important , but -- of this <unk> of <unk> is just that people have experiences <unk> experiences because the <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation think that <unk> is their <unk> .
So the final result is that in general , we &apos;re better , <unk> , but we &apos;re worse .
Let me show you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all get to do for good and it &apos;s completely <unk> . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than not <unk> , but from this <unk> , not <unk> that much better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a <unk> value , <unk> . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve <unk> from a piece of the level that the <unk> choices we have to <unk> our lives .
Now , from the <unk> perspective , I &apos;ve almost finished -- from the point of view <unk> , <unk> is the <unk> .
What <unk> this choice in <unk> society is the <unk> <unk> .
There are many places in the world , and you &apos;re going to <unk> , where the problem is not that they have choice .
The problem is that they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I &apos;m talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> yesterday about how those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> are <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> of money .
I mean , these choices , <unk> and <unk> , not that &apos;s just <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
They make worse .
If a little bit about what in our society <unk> <unk> was <unk> in those where people have too much <unk> , it would not just their life <unk> , but it &apos;s our <unk> .
That &apos;s what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income is good at all -- not just the poor -- not just the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we <unk> .
To <unk> , &quot; <unk> , you can become everything you want ,
<unk> , people of culture , <unk> , &quot; What are you going to do that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s <unk> you can &apos;t get to <unk> . &quot;
&quot; A <unk> imagination , a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and I <unk> it , I <unk> it , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I realized that that fish knows that fish knows the long one .
Because the reality of fact is that if you <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> , the way that &quot; everything is possible . &quot; You don &apos;t <unk> the freedom . You <unk> the <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
They all need a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly <unk> for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , <unk> .
Thank you very much .
