<unk> year I showed this <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years of the United States had the size of the United States <unk> , has <unk> <unk> <unk> , has <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> this <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a way , the heart <unk> of climate system .
It &apos;s <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You see , it &apos;s going to <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That &apos;s the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> in summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , of five or more , it &apos;s like the blood <unk> , which here is from the body .
In 25 years it was done this , so ,
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> around the <unk> of <unk> where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> , <unk> , are <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , that amount of <unk> , that amount of <unk> , we &apos;re not going to be .
In some of the <unk> <unk> in <unk> the <unk> is already <unk> from the water .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! Al <unk> : She &apos;s good . The question is if we <unk> it .
One reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the north .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> had never <unk> like that .
This is the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
If you want to know how the sea level <unk> for the sea <unk> on <unk> , here is where the sea is where the sea is going to <unk> .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> on the planet : <unk> , the biggest <unk> of the planet &apos;s ice <unk> .
<unk> month scientists <unk> <unk> that the ice <unk> is in <unk> , and that the Western <unk> , which <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> at six feet of <unk> , as in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the biggest third <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which few years ago were <unk> .
<unk> 40 percent of the world &apos;s population <unk> <unk> by the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : this <unk> is the source of <unk> water in this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when you &apos;re <unk> , the same thing happens to <unk> water .
In California , <unk> on <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are in crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they &apos;re <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the world is <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and without <unk> .
<unk> times over the last 30 years of <unk> than <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> .
If you look at it in the <unk> context , you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we &apos;ve <unk> million <unk> of CO2 <unk> , <unk> million <unk> in the oceans , 25 million <unk> in the oceans .
Look at <unk> the <unk> area of <unk> <unk> , from <unk> , to <unk> , and on both <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , where there is a <unk> <unk> oxygen in the ocean .
The biggest cause of global warming , together to the <unk> , which is 20 percent of <unk> .
<unk> is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And you &apos;re trying to build a lot of other <unk> <unk> .
But we &apos;re starting to a <unk> of the <unk> .
These are the <unk> projects over the last few years and some <unk> <unk> .
Every way , there is a political <unk> in our own country .
<unk> of <unk> and oil have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
<unk> image , I <unk> something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> .
You may see it on the <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> in America .
It &apos;s been around <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> <unk> is a <unk> and happy .
It &apos;s here in America , and it &apos;s <unk> our economy .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> .
It &apos;s at good price , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> here is a lot of <unk> <unk> .
The biggest <unk> society on the <unk> <unk> is <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
<unk> : So <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , one hand .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> , we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> in our business .
So , for our <unk> is <unk> a lot of money in a <unk> <unk> for public and <unk> the truth on <unk> .
In fact , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it &apos;s <unk> -- it &apos;s got a good <unk> .
So we don &apos;t talk about climate change .
We could do it .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you &apos;ve heard about it a lot .
So , I &apos;m going to take a <unk> <unk> structure for the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> are a little <unk> , but this is the sound of <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> is between the main <unk> of global <unk> , but the <unk> technology <unk> that you see all the way .
Let &apos;s look at this : this is the <unk> <unk> technology .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security .
<unk> : <unk> : America is in the crisis ; the economy , national security crisis .
The <unk> that all the <unk> of all of them : our <unk> from <unk> <unk> and oil .
Now , there &apos;s a new solution , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan to <unk> America to work , <unk> more <unk> , and help <unk> the global <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we can solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
<unk> : This is the last .
<unk> : <unk> : This is about energy <unk> .
One of the most <unk> of <unk> <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , sun , a new <unk> network .
<unk> <unk> 2 : <unk> <unk> for jobs well .
<unk> : <unk> America . It &apos;s time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A <unk> <unk> <unk> says , &quot; If you want to go alone .
If you want to go far , go together . &quot;
We have to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED , I made a <unk> on <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to try to <unk> how the machine works .
So here we go . And for the ones that the other time were there , the <unk> was the biggest scientific experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
His job is to <unk> the conditions that were present less than a <unk> <unk> in the beginning of the universe -- to <unk> million times a second .
All of this is just <unk> .
This is the <unk> machine .
We <unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk> .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called <unk> -- is <unk> <unk> feet . And it &apos;s <unk> feet .
This is a <unk> picture of <unk> in construction . You can see the <unk> .
<unk> 10 <unk> of last year we <unk> the machine for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in control room .
It &apos;s a picture of the first particles that he had done all the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles in the <unk> .
In other words , when I <unk> that image the <unk> 10 <unk> , I <unk> the <unk> machine , which is a big <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if this was this <unk> <unk> , or this , when somebody <unk> on Google and they would <unk> that the <unk> page was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a <unk> impact on that scientific .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine works at the <unk> of <unk> .
Now , the <unk> of you <unk> <unk> and <unk> , &quot; It &apos;s not true . I &apos;m <unk> . &quot;
And they can do it because when they &apos;re very <unk> to get the <unk> <unk> .
So , at less degrees <unk> , at the <unk> temperature , and these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> between the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think these are more than 20 <unk> , and that are <unk> about 30 <unk> .
It &apos;s about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , which we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
Now they &apos;re <unk> all of their <unk> place .
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> is going to be new <unk> .
We <unk> it , and we <unk> to get data to <unk> or <unk> , and on so our <unk> to discover what the universe are <unk> .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering <unk> engineering . It &apos;s easy to <unk> .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s the value of things like <unk> .
I &apos;d like to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> , in <unk> of <unk> <unk> experiments , who was <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , said , &quot; No is that <unk> for the progress of the human mind how <unk> that ideas are <unk> , that there are no <unk> in nature , which our <unk> are <unk> , and that our <unk> are <unk> .
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> <unk> when , as a children , <unk> with <unk> .
<unk> as we <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , actually <unk> and <unk> , actually <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way most of the world around us .
So , as a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects , <unk> with my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started to <unk> : &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having the only <unk> <unk> of the <unk> as a digital <unk> that <unk> <unk> on a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> , <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> of information with both with both hands ,
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that I decided to explore the answer , building the <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , they can <unk> each other , and feel their movement and have a screen <unk> and a <unk> radio .
But <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> .
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> the digital information .
And as they become more <unk> , they <unk> their movement , <unk> , other people , and as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement , of others , as we can explore new <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Let &apos;s start with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show the video : if we <unk> it in one direction , the <unk> video , the <unk> video , if we <unk> on the other side .
These <unk> are <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , they &apos;re <unk> to what it &apos;s going around .
If they &apos;re <unk> , they can <unk> it a little bit .
If they &apos;re <unk> , they can <unk> it a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We realized one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> was the <unk> that we could use common data on data , for example , <unk> a color like if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> it to <unk> the color , where they <unk> .
and I can <unk> for <unk> of the color in that central .
We can <unk> it a little bit of that we can <unk> a little bit .
There are also <unk> possibilities of <unk> , like <unk> , <unk> , math and <unk> and <unk> where people can <unk> things , and they <unk> the results are immediately .
Now I &apos;m ...
This is a <unk> sequence I do with a <unk> <unk> program .
Here we have a game of words that is <unk> half between <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> , a letter <unk> on every <unk> , <unk> , at every <unk> , at every <unk> , and as I was <unk> <unk> words on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try and
Thank you .
Here are children <unk> in <unk> <unk> , I did so that I <unk> them and I <unk> a video .
They &apos;re very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things like this is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just wanted to say , &quot; <unk> of words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , there on the right .
In fact he wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to build a tool for the <unk> of <unk> . He &apos;s <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So , it &apos;s making the sun out .
<unk> : <unk> is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now he brought a <unk> in the scene in the scene .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! Yeah !
So , we <unk> <unk> and <unk> can make the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
-- <unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time to show you is a tool that made of recently , and <unk> music .
It &apos;s a tool , that &apos;s recently that we &apos;re <unk> and <unk> music .
<unk> here is <unk> as basic as <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of these has four different <unk> , and you can use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of <unk> to your <unk> .
And we &apos;re going to <unk> a <unk> sound and a sequence .
These are actually <unk> that you can control from live , like <unk> and <unk> .
We <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are the <unk> effects of time and <unk> , which is <unk> to the whole sequence .
<unk> how it works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> in a series , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , on the <unk> , <unk> , on the <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m going to <unk> a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : And now I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> to the <unk> , so I can control the <unk> alive .
<unk> : I can <unk> the whole sequence of time from one side or another .
<unk> : <unk> : And now we &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> down to <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the sequence of flight .
So I don &apos;t have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> it , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the whole sequence on the left the whole <unk> on the left <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain work and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this path , and some possibilities we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to <unk> is that it &apos;s <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> with media <unk> , which <unk> information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the <unk> of my life .
And it doesn &apos;t look like that .
But , in fact , something particular happened in my life and in my life , which led me to <unk> the whole relationship with this job .
The particular thing is I <unk> wrote this book , this <unk> called &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> my books , for some <unk> reason in the world and <unk> a big , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere we are <unk> , people <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> !
<unk> from me now everybody <unk> and say , &quot; <unk> &apos;t you &apos;re afraid to not be able to do better ?
You &apos;re not afraid to go and write for all life without being able to create a book that can <unk> somebody ? &quot;
How can it <unk> to someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , except I remember that over the years ago , when I was <unk> to say to people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
I was at the same <unk> <unk> from fear .
And people said , &quot; <unk> &apos;t you know , you &apos;re not going to be successful ?
<unk> you have no fear of the <unk> <unk> you ?
<unk> you don &apos;t <unk> to do this <unk> all life without any <unk> of it .
So , you know .
The short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I <unk> of all those things .
I &apos;ve always been afraid .
And I <unk> also a lot of other things that people can &apos;t <unk> .
Like <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as far as I thought , and <unk> me , is it ?
Is it <unk> ?
It &apos;s <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you &apos;re <unk> to do .
But what is so particular about the <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not ?
How my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I don &apos;t remember one time in his <unk> <unk> in his <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> &apos;t -- that <unk> of the <unk> John , how did it go ?
<unk> &apos;t you so , <unk> ?
<unk> , the engineers <unk> like <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have enough , and not only <unk> but <unk> of all kinds of , we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
And so , as we <unk> to look at the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , young and often <unk> for them .
And the ones who don &apos;t seem to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before they die , in the last <unk> said , &quot; Every my book <unk> me a little bit more <unk> . &quot; One extraordinary <unk> about work of his life .
But we didn &apos;t know when we <unk> it , because we &apos;ve heard these things so long that we &apos;ve heard and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and creativity <unk> are somehow <unk> and <unk> the arts , at the end , <unk> , <unk> always <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> you to all over here today is : <unk> with this idea ?
You &apos;re good at this thing -- because it &apos;s going to be <unk> by a <unk> away to me not that good at all .
I think it &apos;s <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s also <unk> and I don &apos;t want to <unk> it in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better <unk> our <unk> <unk> to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- in my own situation -- it would be very <unk> to start to that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> that I &apos;m in my career .
<unk> -- <unk> look , they &apos;re pretty young , I &apos;m a <unk> <unk> , I &apos;ve been around 40 years old .
I &apos;ve got about four <unk> of work in me .
And it &apos;s very <unk> that anything you &apos;re going to be <unk> by the world as the job of the work that <unk> after my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we &apos;re all <unk> friends here -- it &apos;s <unk> that my biggest <unk> is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> thought !
You know , the kind of thought that brings a person to start <unk> to nine <unk> on <unk> <unk> at nine <unk> in the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
We should continue doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so , it seems to me , after many <unk> , that the way to work on creating a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to have a <unk> distance between me , which I &apos;m <unk> , and the natural <unk> that <unk> that <unk> that <unk> that <unk> that <unk> that <unk> that <unk> <unk> to get . And as I was <unk> for all last year , trying to find other society to see if you have the best ideas and more <unk> .
how to help people <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research led me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s because it &apos;s going to be <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don &apos;t believe that creativity is <unk> by men , OK ?
It turns out that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> from some <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity <unk> of creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from far away .
<unk> were the same idea , but they were <unk> that sort of the spirit without a <unk> .
which is <unk> , because the <unk> doesn &apos;t really <unk> that a <unk> was particularly smart .
I thought a <unk> was this sort of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally <unk> in the <unk> of a <unk> artist , a little like the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> out to <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the <unk> of that work .
<unk> <unk> , here is the distance I talk about -- that <unk> <unk> you from the results of your work .
And everyone <unk> that was so that it was , right ?
So the <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like too <unk> , right ?
If your work was <unk> you didn &apos;t have to <unk> the whole <unk> , everybody would be <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it wasn &apos;t all your <unk> , right ?
Everybody <unk> it was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> creativity is going to be very long for a long time .
And then the <unk> <unk> and everything , and we <unk> this great idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe above all of the <unk> and <unk> and no longer to <unk> creatures that <unk> <unk> out of <unk> .
This was the <unk> principle and people started to think that creativity was completely from the <unk> .
And for the first time in history , it &apos;s <unk> to <unk> to this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think of somebody , a simple person to believe that they &apos;re like a <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> of all <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a responsibility for too big to give <unk> human <unk> .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> the <unk> and creates all of these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s been this pressure to have 500 years to be <unk> .
And , if that &apos;s true , and I think it &apos;s , the question becomes , and I think it &apos;s now ?
Can we do it <unk> ?
I could go back to a <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t <unk> 500 years of thinking in a <unk> <unk> .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of , <unk> , <unk> , do you <unk> people <unk> <unk> on their projects .
You &apos;re probably not going to <unk> you all this .
But the question I &apos;d like to <unk> is -- why not ?
Why not we &apos;re not going to be in this way ?
Because more sense of everything that has ever heard about to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process .
<unk> process , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so , basically , everyone here -- it &apos;s not <unk> .
And , in fact , it can sometimes be completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , who now 90 years , but who was a <unk> for all of life and said that in his <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> , and <unk> it , in the <unk> , and we <unk> it up in the <unk> .
She said it was like a <unk> <unk> of the air .
And she <unk> <unk> to her from the <unk> .
We <unk> it to get , because it was <unk> the earth under its feet .
I decided to have one thing to do at that point and was , words , &quot; <unk> as a <unk> . &quot;
And so he went back home and he came from this <unk> , and he wouldn &apos;t have anything else that take a paper <unk> and a <unk> enough <unk> , and we <unk> and <unk> on the page .
<unk> times you can &apos;t be enough fast , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> them to get to home and <unk> it up through the <unk> , looking , and she would <unk> up through the <unk> , looking , like she said , &quot; another <unk> . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this piece of the time , it never -- there were moments when the time was almost <unk> , OK ?
So , he was coming home and he was looking for paper and <unk> the <unk> through , and he <unk> a <unk> <unk> in the while he was <unk> , and then he said , he was <unk> with the other hand and <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> out of the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk> , but the <unk> , from the last word to the first word .
So when I <unk> him -- it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
not all my <unk> process -- I &apos;m not a <unk> !
I &apos;m a <unk> , and my way to <unk> is ; I <unk> it every day and <unk> and work and <unk> and <unk> and work and <unk> and <unk> and work and <unk> and <unk> and work and <unk> and <unk> and work and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and work and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and work and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and work and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and work and
But even I , in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I <unk> many of you the <unk> .
You know , even though the job and ideas <unk> me from a certain source , I could not <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it in a way to <unk> not <unk> our head , but rather , that it &apos;s <unk> us ?
As far as I am , the best example of the <unk> <unk> I &apos;ve <unk> <unk> , which I <unk> several years ago for a <unk> .
I was talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , trying to control , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
But then he <unk> , he <unk> , and one day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> it all for him .
<unk> <unk> , and all of a <unk> <unk> , <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> , who comes in his head as <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the <unk> , but it doesn &apos;t know how to <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
So it starts to feel this kind of old <unk> <unk> in him like , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose it from this <unk> song .
I &apos;m not <unk> enough and I can &apos;t <unk> it . &quot;
And instead of going to go to the <unk> , they <unk> .
We <unk> the whole <unk> process and made something completely new .
<unk> just the sky and said , &quot; <unk> , you don &apos;t see that I &apos;m <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> it can <unk> you . &quot;
If you really want to <unk> , you &apos;re going to take care of you .
<unk> , we &apos;re going to <unk> more today .
<unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And his process <unk> <unk> <unk> after this .
<unk> &apos;t work , it was still <unk> as always as <unk> .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> out of him <unk> , he <unk> it back , where he came from where he came from , and he <unk> it back , and he <unk> it back and <unk> .
But I <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this thing <unk> and <unk> thing , but it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
And as I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit of a way that I <unk> and I &apos;ve already <unk> up .
This idea , I <unk> when I was <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> in one of those <unk> of the <unk> that we <unk> all <unk> when we &apos;re working on something and we &apos;re not going to be <unk> , and you &apos;re going to be thinking that will be a <unk> , which is going to be the book .
Not only <unk> , right <unk> .
And we started thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I decided to <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> corner of the room .
And I said <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , what , we both know that if this book is not going to be <unk> <unk> , my <unk> ?
Because you see me , I &apos;m <unk> everything I have , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to <unk> and do your way .
Okay . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know , you don &apos;t do it .
I started writing the same because it &apos;s my job .
And I would like to <unk> that I &apos;m <unk> today to do my own part . &quot; Because at the end is , OK -- let &apos;s do it do in the <unk> of Africa , the people <unk> to <unk> it to <unk> and <unk> that will go back and hours and <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every once in a lot , <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> .
And I know that you know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you &apos;ve all seen , at some point , a <unk> like this .
It was as if time <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it wasn &apos;t doing anything different from the usually <unk> , as the <unk> <unk> before , but everything was <unk> .
And all of a sudden , we don &apos;t just like a human .
But it <unk> up from <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , we <unk> it up .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , they <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which is , you &apos;re still <unk> to hear in <unk> or in the <unk> .
In <unk> , when an artist did something impossible to <unk> and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it &apos;s <unk> because we need it .
But , the problem comes the next day , for the <unk> itself , when you <unk> and <unk> and <unk> that are 11 <unk> of <unk> and <unk> God is no longer there .
It &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> with a lot of <unk> to <unk> , and perhaps never <unk> more to <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still as we go , and what has to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so <unk> if you can &apos;t believe , <unk> , <unk> , that the most <unk> <unk> of your being come from yourself .
But let &apos;s just <unk> you data from a <unk> of this <unk> part of your life that you have to <unk> it .
And , you know , if we think it &apos;s all changing .
And so I started <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> like I <unk> it for several months in the <unk> of the book that <unk> soon , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> of my success .
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , I don &apos;t fear .
You don &apos;t know . You just have your work .
<unk> <unk> for your <unk> , any way you can be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , <unk> <unk> you will <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for one moment through your <unk> , then you &apos;re going to go .
<unk> , you do the same <unk> .
And &quot; <unk> ! &quot; to you do it .
I think , and I think <unk> <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; to you know it , even for <unk> love human and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know I &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can <unk> and find genes of new genes .
Now we &apos;re looking at a new process : we &apos;ve started <unk> the biology and now from that digital code , we &apos;re <unk> in a new <unk> <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We &apos;ve always tried to <unk> big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; is something that many <unk> I think they &apos;ve <unk> to understand various <unk> .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> terms .
We &apos;re <unk> for almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> from the <unk> world of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> world of computer .
Now , we &apos;re <unk> : <unk> life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species of the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> a little bit even smaller .
We can <unk> <unk> <unk> of genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we look at his <unk> map , it &apos;s <unk> as simple as our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at a time , it &apos;s very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell .
So we knew that the only way to <unk> this <unk> <unk> in a way to <unk> some of these <unk> questions .
And so we started the <unk> of &quot; <unk> we can <unk> a <unk> ? &quot;
Can the chemistry <unk> to produce these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And , in case , can we make a <unk> ?
<unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> material .
<unk> with which we &apos;re able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> .
Our ability to write the <unk> code , instead of <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> .
And our most <unk> results of the <unk> on a <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before they <unk> the first experiments .
But we found that DNA <unk> is very hard .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> process : the more of <unk> is , more <unk> , more <unk> , <unk> there are .
So we had to develop a new <unk> for <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , from information <unk> <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
It &apos;s a little <unk> that bacteria .
We designed the <unk> , we <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of about <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> material and we <unk> it in bacteria , and we <unk> it in bacteria , and they <unk> the <unk> particles .
<unk> particles have been there from cells , they &apos;re <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I talked about recently members of the <unk> industry that they &apos;ve certainly <unk> this model .
They <unk> more than you .
I think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we could do the bigger things .
We had to build the entire <unk> of <unk> .
They are more than <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> code .
So we thought of <unk> in <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , so that we can change the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> information in a computer , these have to be very <unk> .
When we did this genome for the first time , the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve discovered , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If you could use that original sequence never <unk> to work .
One part of the process is going to be <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> <unk> to build smaller <unk> that we <unk> together .
<unk> elements here .
You &apos;ve probably read that <unk> us of <unk> .
So , we have a <unk> code <unk> on four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and there &apos;s a <unk> order of <unk> for each <unk> .
So we can use the <unk> code for writing , <unk> , <unk> .
And what we did at the beginning was <unk> .
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> <unk> .
There are <unk> <unk> and <unk> them .
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , we &apos;ve produced these <unk> in <unk> so that we &apos;re trying to create a very <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re trying to create very <unk> <unk> as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to <unk> the process .
So , this seems the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When we &apos;re going to <unk> these <unk> <unk> , more than 100 <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re not <unk> directly in the <unk> .
You get to the <unk> <unk> of <unk> biology .
So we &apos;ve <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> <unk> to <unk> the DNA that can <unk> the <unk> .
Here &apos;s an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> as its <unk> <unk> .
In 12 -- it &apos;s <unk> hours , exactly as it was before .
<unk> of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely .
We should live under <unk> .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
Actually , NASA has shown that this happens .
This is a picture of the <unk> we &apos;ve built up these <unk> , just using the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
This picture was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we &apos;ve done a little time ago .
They are more than <unk> <unk> of <unk> code .
It &apos;s the biggest <unk> of a <unk> structure ever <unk> by man .
It has a <unk> <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a 10 <unk> without spaces , we &apos;re going to <unk> pages just to <unk> this code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we <unk> it ?
Of course , a virus is a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a little more <unk> when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s more simple when it comes from cells like our <unk> : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the <unk> process .
In <unk> , the <unk> is instead of <unk> in the cell , but we &apos;ve <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re able to do a <unk> <unk> from one cell to another and <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> species .
<unk> are different than men are from <unk> .
We &apos;ve <unk> some <unk> in order to decide what you &apos;re going to choose what this <unk> .
He then <unk> it <unk> with <unk> in a way to <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> , the new <unk> <unk> <unk> in the cell .
And we were <unk> <unk> that we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to <unk> more .
This is one of the biggest <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere , we <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So who think of evolution as a <unk> at the time you <unk> not <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> DNA .
The <unk> that was in the cell , it wasn &apos;t <unk> one .
The <unk> <unk> we <unk> it .
It &apos;s <unk> , and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material , he <unk> , and we <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk> .
has become blue because of the genes we &apos;ve <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all of the <unk> species , all of the <unk> species , and it &apos;s <unk> all in a new species , <unk> on the new software that we &apos;ve <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code that will <unk> exactly what we &apos;ve <unk> .
Now , this may be <unk> <unk> , but we <unk> the software DNA , we can change things in a pretty <unk> .
Now , I &apos;ve already <unk> that here isn &apos;t about <unk> -- but this is <unk> from three million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new <unk> version of <unk> that we &apos;re going to create new <unk> species on this <unk> process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> when we think of our <unk> .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion people , in the next 40 years .
Just to give you an example : I was born in <unk> .
Now , there are three people on the planet to <unk> it in <unk> ; it &apos;s going to be four .
We &apos;re <unk> now to find food , <unk> water and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> for six billion people .
We &apos;re going to be even more <unk> to do it for nine billion .
We &apos;re going to <unk> over five billion <unk> , over 30 billion <unk> .
That means 100 million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process to <unk> , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
In more we have to <unk> all of the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
At the same time , because of the <unk> <unk> in the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that it &apos;s the <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry <unk> only a <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here are <unk> data from the <unk> of <unk> and our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , thank you for these <unk> <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think about <unk> these 20 million genes , or <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> new <unk> , we can change , because we can change , we &apos;re a small team , and create more biology that we can change , we &apos;re going to <unk> biology that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard <unk> .
We can choose for <unk> , <unk> , chemistry or chemistry , <unk> <unk> production of <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some <unk> software that we &apos;re working on to be able to <unk> and design species at the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how to be .
We know exactly how their code code .
Now we &apos;re <unk> on the generation of <unk> .
You saw <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We <unk> on the second and third generation that we will be <unk> <unk> soon <unk> from <unk> to <unk> more <unk> like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way biology can have a huge impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would <unk> be <unk> in matter before , so we &apos;re working to design cells that can reach that <unk> , and we think we will <unk> the first generation of <unk> <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> solar <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> we <unk> in the <unk> .
We &apos;re going to be in the deep ocean , at about <unk> feet deep <unk> .
<unk> <unk> by <unk> using hydrogen <unk> as energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2 , which can easily be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> of the CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So we <unk> we think we might be able to <unk> what the basic question , &quot; what is life is we , we <unk> <unk> , we have the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole <unk> of <unk> the whole <unk> industry .
<unk> . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can &apos;t it from TED , where you can &apos;t it from TED , where can &apos;t it from TED , where you can &apos;t it from TED , where you can &apos;t it from TED , where you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can &apos;t it from TED , where can &apos;t it from TED .
We &apos;re going to <unk> a <unk> of energy .
<unk> , we &apos;re working on using the same <unk> to use <unk> .
You saw this year with the flu , we &apos;re always <unk> a year and with a dollar less when it comes back to a dollar less when it comes to find the right .
I think that you can change <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
So , here &apos;s how the future could start to look <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> evolution with <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and finally , <unk> cells .
We are so <unk> to <unk> people .
Our purpose is to do in a way of living living <unk> <unk> . Thank you very much . Thank you very much . Thank you .
First of all , I &apos;m going to show you , the <unk> as quickly , some fundamental <unk> that we &apos;ve taken <unk> to a <unk> <unk> almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
It &apos;s a environment where you can <unk> is at local level that <unk> with a huge amount of data .
We &apos;re seeing <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> and <unk> , for a quick <unk> , <unk> , <unk> images like we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much the amount of information we see , how big it is , how big it &apos;s <unk> of data or images .
Most of them are common photographs , but this is a <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen . It &apos;s also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , which is not of images .
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , in fact , it &apos;s <unk> and not of images , we can do something like this , to really see it &apos;s about a real <unk> text , not a picture .
It could be a little bit <unk> to read a <unk> book .
You don &apos;t know .
This is an example of the <unk> . This is a number of <unk> .
Every image a big picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the good experience and the beautiful experience of reading the real <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> kind of half .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of The <unk> .
We &apos;ve created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much higher than what you use in a normal <unk> , and we <unk> the <unk> content .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see it here .
Or even the <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
We believe that this is actually going to put together and other <unk> <unk> , we don &apos;t want to be <unk> .
Of course , <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say we have <unk> <unk> to give in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. <unk> over a <unk> picture .
So now we &apos;re going to try something else .
This is actually live on the web ; you can go to see .
This is a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> computer that &apos;s interesting <unk> computer <unk> , a very interesting student student <unk> in Washington , with the help of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s live on the web , <unk> by <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can <unk> from an image to the other and have this kind of experience of <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of images here actually has meaning .
<unk> <unk> of the computer <unk> have <unk> these images together , so that they <unk> to <unk> places that <unk> all close to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to <unk> directly to one of the <unk> of <unk> and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that we &apos;ve done for the first summer , I &apos;m going to <unk> you to <unk> what &apos;s really the key behind this technology , <unk> . And it &apos;s not <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> that we put in the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> and so on .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of types of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> . And so on . <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> an image that <unk> is <unk> a picture that &apos;s <unk> <unk> to this model .
So they &apos;re all <unk> <unk> and all of them are <unk> at the <unk> level in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to <unk> in this <unk> way .
You know , I would never have thought to work for <unk> .
It &apos;s very <unk> <unk> . This kind of <unk> here .
I think we &apos;re going to see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of <unk> : from those cell phones to those <unk> <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I <unk> to look at those <unk> .
A lot of <unk> , <unk> , etc .
<unk> here is a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from <unk> to the physics of this environment .
The <unk> point is that we can do things with the environment . This is now <unk> data from the whole <unk> memory of how we <unk> the earth , from the <unk> view and <unk> all of that data together .
All of those pictures become <unk> together , higher than the parts of the parts .
You have a whole model of the whole thing that <unk> .
Think about this as a <unk> of <unk> &apos;s work on Earth &apos;s <unk> .
It &apos;s something that is <unk> in complexity , as people will <unk> it , and the <unk> for the people who <unk> it with <unk> .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> by other people .
If anybody &apos;s a idea of <unk> all of these <unk> <unk> the name , my picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , they <unk> all of those data , and I can use <unk> as a <unk> <unk> <unk> in that space , in that <unk> , using the pictures , using the pictures of everyone else , and have a social experience of <unk> and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all of this is extremely <unk> <unk> of every part interesting part of the land , <unk> not only <unk> and <unk> images and similar , but from the <unk> .
Thank you very much .
CA : I understand ? What &apos;s good is that you have to do is that at some point , in the next few years , all of the pictures from anybody in the world , they &apos;re going to be <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is we &apos;re going to discover .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> , if you want , in the images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the <unk> of images .
And it turns out to be very interesting if you think about the <unk> information that a lot of these <unk> images .
As you get a research of images on the web , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the web has a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture is <unk> to all your pictures ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really huge . It &apos;s a <unk> effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it &apos;s really incredible . <unk> .
<unk> : I &apos;m going to <unk> you .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is the <unk> that we can live between the wind , the <unk> in the wind <unk> , the <unk> in the <unk> of the plants .
We think that <unk> <unk> <unk> still beyond the <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , or that <unk> , <unk> <unk> still <unk> the <unk> <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , and that the idea that the world that we live in there is no <unk> , but it &apos;s just a model , but it &apos;s just a model of reality ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> <unk> that our <unk> has done , good or bad , a lot of <unk> does .
And , of course , everyone <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . Everybody <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We have to <unk> the <unk> of death , so we don &apos;t know if we <unk> and <unk> --
We all have an art .
What <unk> is the particular <unk> of the song of the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the <unk> heart .
He was my <unk> <unk> in the <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of the world .
All of these <unk> are <unk> that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And , if you &apos;re going to <unk> , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> of the world create a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and <unk> is important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> known as <unk> .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the total <unk> of all of the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , ideas , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> in being from being of the <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> is the <unk> <unk> of humanity .
It &apos;s the <unk> of what we can be as <unk> species .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> much faster .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the <unk> of <unk> just because it &apos;s <unk> , or -- in the <unk> more <unk> -- in the field of diversity -- and you don &apos;t even know about <unk> <unk> -- that of the diversity .
The <unk> of this is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
One language is not just <unk> by a <unk> or a series of <unk> rules .
One language is the <unk> of the spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of the <unk> that the <unk> of every culture comes in the material .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we &apos;re here at <unk> , at least half is not <unk> in the <unk> of children .
They don &apos;t come to children , which means , unless you do something , which is not <unk> .
What is more <unk> than the <unk> of being <unk> by the <unk> , of the last few language , of not <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of children ?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of somebody in some part of the world every two weeks : every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and <unk> it <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
And I know anybody you say , &quot; <unk> &apos;t it ?
The world would not be a better place if we all the same language ? &quot; <unk> , then we talk all of them . <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> of a <unk> thing means that it can &apos;t talk its own language .
I &apos;d like to make you a trip through the <unk> --
a little trip in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we &apos;re <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say &quot; different ways of <unk> &quot; I really want different ways of <unk> .
So , for example , this <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , which <unk> to <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> that can &apos;t <unk> the blue color from green because the green color from green , because the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> of the forest , which <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; : you have to <unk> a person talking different language .
All of this has <unk> in the <unk> past , <unk> is that in these <unk> families , where they &apos;re talking about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> nobody practice .
You &apos;re going to hear and then <unk> to talk .
I <unk> one of the most interesting <unk> that I lived with , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> contact with a <unk> <unk> .
They did <unk> from the top of photographs that they were <unk> , <unk> that <unk> of <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> forest had never seen anything .
They <unk> the <unk> <unk> , they <unk> to <unk> <unk> for a form or a <unk> and , and they didn &apos;t know anything , they <unk> it <unk> up , and they <unk> the five <unk> with the <unk> .
But <unk> not only <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re going to be <unk> .
<unk> percent of <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We went back to eight <unk> and found two cases of natural death and we <unk> it to know , they <unk> that one of them was so <unk> that he died , and then they <unk> it .
<unk> were able to recognize the animal &apos;s <unk> for <unk> and to <unk> the species .
<unk> the early &apos; <unk> , it was <unk> to me a very interesting task when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me , if I wanted to go to <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> .
To make sense of <unk> , I should have to understand the <unk> culture , and that <unk> is not <unk> .
It &apos;s pretty <unk> view of the world .
<unk> interesting .
If you &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the world , what would you <unk> me ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
One continent is always <unk> out , thinking that <unk> Africa doesn &apos;t <unk> <unk> . And instead , you know , the <unk> is not the other than the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> very <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
What makes interesting is that <unk> is the <unk> of life and death .
So <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by <unk> <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> in a live short time so that for a short moment , the <unk> becomes the <unk> .
So , the <unk> <unk> say , &quot; <unk> <unk> go to <unk> to the <unk> of God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . &quot;
And as you &apos;re <unk> , is the spirit that you &apos;re <unk> , how can you <unk> it ?
So , you &apos;re <unk> to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> in the state of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> a very strong <unk> of the power of the body when it was <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> all the <unk> that I &apos;ve lived the most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> <unk> that once <unk> <unk> <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> has never been <unk> by <unk> .
Now , today I &apos;m <unk> by a <unk> <unk> , but their education is extraordinary <unk> .
<unk> are <unk> by <unk> families from <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years , and they live in a world that &apos;s done in <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
Two <unk> <unk> years of the <unk> of the <unk> nine months of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of mother , now are <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
For all this time , they &apos;re <unk> to values about their society , values that they &apos;re <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> .
And at the end of this incredible <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> out and for the first time in their <unk> , to age 18 , and they see a <unk> . And in that moment of <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> , everything they learned in the theory is <unk> , everything they learned in the theory is <unk> all of the <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> back and says .
&quot; <unk> ? <unk> as I said .
It &apos;s <unk> . Now it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
They call the major <unk> they say that we are , <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re the <unk> of the world .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think about <unk> <unk> and the old <unk> <unk> and the old history of <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> concept in its <unk> or <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are closer to Earth .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by <unk> .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> , but <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , has created a <unk> of the Earth &apos;s <unk> not about the concept of <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> . The idea that the Earth can only live because it &apos;s <unk> by human <unk> .
What does that mean ?
I mean that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> the mountain is a <unk> spirit that <unk> its <unk> is going to be a very different <unk> and will have a <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> a mountain or that will have a <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> a mountain <unk> that <unk> that <unk> that a mountain is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
That made me a human being different from my <unk> friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> that live north of <unk> , <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> .
If we started <unk> that these <unk> can create different , we could actually start to understand some of their <unk> <unk> . We <unk> this <unk> .
I <unk> this picture of <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What makes the fascinating thing that <unk> is not the <unk> potential of <unk> , but its <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> .
On one hand , this <unk> <unk> that <unk> has a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you &apos;re going to see the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> that &apos;s <unk> , <unk> it &apos;s <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . <unk> &apos;t creates a <unk> of electricity .
I often talk to my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of <unk> in the &apos; <unk> in the &apos; <unk> .
<unk> to my <unk> you can &apos;t <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you &apos;re done , you can &apos;t tell anybody to be <unk> . <unk> can &apos;t be <unk> <unk> because they &apos;re <unk> by a <unk> that is <unk> of <unk> , <unk> .
It &apos;s possible to <unk> <unk> if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now , this is the <unk> that are <unk> in this <unk> are <unk> of <unk> , the same kind of <unk> <unk> . The <unk> question is : in a <unk> <unk> -- <unk> -- in a <unk> of <unk> , how they &apos;re doing these <unk> two <unk> don &apos;t similar , but that if they <unk> it in this way , they create a <unk> that is <unk> <unk> at the <unk> of the parts ?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you go to the <unk> , we &apos;re going to <unk> &quot; <unk> us &quot; <unk> . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , who <unk> <unk> in the forest , and our eyes in the same species .
If you <unk> it as they <unk> their <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , plants <unk> , the rest of the rest of the rest of the <unk> ? &quot;
The solution is : they <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> and <unk> with a different <unk> .
With that you don &apos;t <unk> , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , &#91; <unk> &#93; the problem is that even those of us who have <unk> <unk> them , but somehow , <unk> to the <unk> of history of our real world than our real world , and <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , <unk> , not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk> , but rather like the was where we <unk> and <unk> and we <unk> <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> diversity and <unk> and <unk> the planet &apos;s mass <unk> and <unk> the planet . Now the problem is not the problem .
All the <unk> were <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities of life .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> don &apos;t have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> and <unk> and <unk> like <unk> don &apos;t <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It &apos;s the power .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And if you look at the world , we &apos;ll find these are not <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that lived in the <unk> to a generation ago , and now we &apos;re going to <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are the disease that are <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> .
If we <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I &apos;m doing a lot of <unk> , you &apos;re going to see the <unk> <unk> of the political <unk> .
And as the <unk> , the <unk> physics of a <unk> is <unk> <unk> , but the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> &apos;s <unk> , not only is <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because of the development is part of <unk> development .
And you can &apos;t understand the <unk> <unk> as long as you go to the <unk> .
I <unk> <unk> miles from <unk> in China in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> <unk> <unk> , I realized what &apos;s behind the <unk> that I <unk> talk about .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> at the <unk> <unk> .
which means that it &apos;s been <unk> at the time of <unk> Chinese .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and her <unk> was <unk> .
It was taken <unk> <unk> at age <unk> at age of two <unk> under his <unk> because he couldn &apos;t live without <unk> .
The <unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> .
One day he <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to work for seven years .
The pain of the <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of <unk> is by <unk> .
<unk> , all of them <unk> to <unk> .
<unk> to live in the world of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> world of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died said that his biggest <unk> was that , in our <unk> <unk> view of the world , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of thinking , but one day we <unk> us by a <unk> <unk> that we have other possibilities .
And it &apos;s <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , who <unk> us to <unk> agriculture , which <unk> us to <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has <unk> 300 years old .
That <unk> story , we didn &apos;t tell all the challenges that we <unk> to <unk> in the <unk> .
When we <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> different <unk> .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all <unk> the possibilities of being what we are : a <unk> species , which has to <unk> that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are great moments of <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> me , he <unk> me <unk> the <unk> story of his <unk> .
<unk> government has not been <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the &apos; <unk> to <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> for his life , <unk> away all of his <unk> away , and all of his <unk> .
We should be sure that <unk> don &apos;t <unk> the cold , we <unk> it .
<unk> <unk> were made of <unk> fish .
The <unk> of this man didn &apos;t <unk> from the night or the <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did it <unk> , <unk> them and <unk> a <unk> .
He &apos;s <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when he <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> you talk about <unk> ? &#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; . &#93; And this , in different ways , &#91; <unk> &#93; <unk> is the <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> of an area of <unk> larger <unk> in California and <unk> <unk> together .
It &apos;s their new <unk> . It &apos;s called <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s all the <unk> resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> at least <unk> at least <unk> <unk> of the planet , we realized that it &apos;s not at all .
For somebody is home .
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> at the time . And for us all , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our children , become part of the <unk> <unk> of hope .
<unk> , we are <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> that <unk> never <unk> .
I <unk> that <unk> --
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and perhaps we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our <unk> site .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public in places to <unk> <unk> , which <unk> from how they &apos;ve seen and , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> for a <unk> world &apos;s <unk> in <unk> , the world <unk> in <unk> , and we have to find a <unk> <unk> world in a <unk> world and we need to find a <unk> world in a <unk> world and we need to <unk> the <unk> world .
where <unk> of all of all of our <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I &apos;m going to <unk> other than you &apos;ve heard and <unk> some <unk> , in case you &apos;re not going to .
I &apos;d like to start with what I call the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all of the <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> : &quot; If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens , &quot; the way to do it is to <unk> the freedom <unk> . &quot;
The reason is , on one hand , in the fact that freedom is itself a value , is <unk> , useful for humans .
<unk> is the fact that if we &apos;re <unk> , each of us can do everything we <unk> our <unk> , without any <unk> in our <unk> , no one that <unk> our <unk> , no one that <unk> in the <unk> .
The way to <unk> freedom is <unk> .
More <unk> , more <unk> , more they are <unk> , and more of them is <unk> .
This , <unk> , is so <unk> <unk> in the society that nobody would <unk> on <unk> .
And it &apos;s also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I <unk> a simple <unk> on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that nobody is already <unk> in your <unk> .
That &apos;s what the <unk> is .
And then you go to the <unk> <unk> <unk> : <unk> , radio , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a huge number of <unk> .
We can make six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one just store .
<unk> <unk> there is <unk> .
<unk> fields : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all of the <unk> services , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , you don &apos;t <unk> it .
<unk> of that , by the way , was that the phone doesn &apos;t ever <unk> .
These days they went .
Now we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> , especially between <unk> .
Here &apos;s cell phones of the future .
My <unk> is the one in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
If you don &apos;t have that in the house , in the house , you &apos;re very <unk> .
And what happens at the end is that people <unk> in <unk> and ask this question . And you know , what is the answer is ? The answer is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
You can &apos;t buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t make things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , is <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : no longer happens in the United States that you &apos;re <unk> from <unk> and the <unk> <unk> you have to do .
Instead , <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> says , &quot; Okay , we could do it , or <unk> , &quot; A <unk> , &quot; <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You <unk> it , &quot; <unk> , what would you do ? &quot;
And the <unk> says , &quot; A <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> and <unk> . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; <unk> if you were me , what would you say ? &quot;
And the <unk> : &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
And we call it &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; , &quot; I <unk> it looks like a beautiful thing .
But it &apos;s actually not that one <unk> the weight and the responsibility to make decisions that make decisions that patient . <unk> the <unk> , to <unk> something that doesn &apos;t know -- and we &apos;re not in the <unk> <unk> to make decisions , which is the patient .
There &apos;s a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me and you , that if you think it doesn &apos;t make any sense , because we can &apos;t <unk> .
But if we can &apos;t <unk> , why can we <unk> them ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> of how it is our <unk> now is a question of choice , as you see in this <unk> , &quot; We don &apos;t want to <unk> children . We don &apos;t want to be <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times we do .
That means that every <unk> , at <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
We went to the family and <unk> , a time perspective , <unk> to almost anyone , was that you could <unk> as soon as possible .
The only real <unk> was to the <unk> of when , and it was not , and what to do after .
<unk> , all of it is really to play .
We &apos;re going to be very smart students , and they &apos;re going to be 20 percent less of work than a time .
And they &apos;re not because they &apos;re not <unk> , because they &apos;re not <unk> .
But why I &apos;m <unk> , I started <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> or not ? <unk> we do it now ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> later ? &quot;
They are <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this <unk> doesn &apos;t <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and <unk> not to get a <unk> <unk> to my <unk> .
And they really have to do that . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the job : we &apos;re <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because the technology allows us to work every day from <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> , and I don &apos;t say anybody , where the <unk> works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What does that mean , this incredible choice of choice , is that we have to decide , <unk> at any time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son to play <unk> , with the <unk> in a <unk> , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , on the <unk> .
And even though they &apos;re all <unk> , every minute we see our son <unk> the <unk> , we &apos;re also <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> , &quot; <unk> to <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> I have to <unk> ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , that &apos;s all of the <unk> experience of your son very different than what it would be in other conditions .
So , from any time , we look and large things , and <unk> , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but not all was a question of choice .
The world &apos;s world today is this : <unk> is , &quot; Is it a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? &quot;
The answer is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the <unk> .
<unk> this choice <unk> two effects of people on people .
The first one , <unk> , is that it <unk> instead of <unk> .
With a lot of <unk> between them , it &apos;s very difficult to do .
I &apos;m going to give you an example of <unk> : a <unk> study <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> <unk> &apos;s <unk> data , the <unk> <unk> company , with about a million <unk> <unk> in different companies .
What she found was that for every 10 to the solutions that are <unk> in more , the <unk> <unk> <unk> two percent .
With 50 <unk> , there &apos;s 10 percent <unk> , there &apos;s 10 percent <unk> than when they &apos;re available only five . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> between them , is it &apos;s hard to decide , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And in <unk> , and still <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , and , of course , <unk> , and , of course , <unk> , <unk> , and , of course , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> ,
<unk> that doesn &apos;t just mean just these <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they &apos;re not going to have enough money , it &apos;s also <unk> that <unk> the decision is so <unk> that we also <unk> the <unk> of work .
They &apos;re not <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> to <unk> <unk> for year from <unk> of work , which would be <unk> to <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> choices .
And I think it &apos;s going to <unk> the world .
&quot; And finally , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ? &quot;
I really want to make the right decision , if it &apos;s for <unk> , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong <unk> , and <unk> the wrong <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even though we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice , at the end of how we <unk> <unk> with less <unk> from the result of how we <unk> to <unk> .
And that for several reasons .
One of them is that with a lot of <unk> between , and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of choice , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> the decision <unk> <unk> by the decision <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the decision ,
even when it was a <unk> decision .
<unk> more choices are , it &apos;s easier to <unk> than any <unk> that is <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> , there is what <unk> call .
Dan <unk> <unk> very well <unk> how the value we give things from what we <unk> .
<unk> , all of the rest of it is easy , it &apos;s very easy to <unk> the <unk> <unk> and be less <unk> than the <unk> that is <unk> .
Here &apos;s an example . I <unk> with all of those who are not in New York .
But that &apos;s probably what it is probably <unk> .
There &apos;s this <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It &apos;s all for them .
We don &apos;t know anything . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; All my <unk> <unk> are away . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> right in front of the house . &quot;
And it <unk> two weeks <unk> from the idea that &apos;s <unk> -- every day the ability to <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when we <unk> it was <unk> .
And the <unk> that we have from <unk> , the more the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It &apos;s about living the moment , and perhaps of the way of living .
But the most important point is that anything you &apos;re <unk> , you &apos;re going to try to do not the other way .
The things that don &apos;t know so many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new <unk> .
They &apos;re almost always <unk> .
<unk> once the <unk> were of one kind of <unk> , <unk> them and <unk> , were <unk> , only after <unk> a <unk> and <unk> a lot of times , and we <unk> a lot of times , and we <unk> out a lot of times , and I started to go well .
So , I started <unk> a couple of new when they were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> said , &quot; <unk> wants to <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
<unk> wants it with <unk> or with <unk> ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; <unk> wants to <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> wants to <unk> or <unk> ? &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
I was <unk> , and after a while I was <unk> , &quot; I want the guy that -- which was the only guy , &quot; he had to <unk> me , so for a <unk> now , I <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , and then <unk> , with the best <unk> of <unk> I ever <unk> .
It was the <unk> . With all that choice I had to do the best .
But I <unk> worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
At the beginning I had <unk> <unk> . I didn &apos;t <unk> anything when I just had one kind of it . But when we <unk> 100 different , we had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
And after they <unk> that they <unk> the <unk> I was <unk> in <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in life of people don &apos;t do that <unk> the <unk> that have been doing respect to the <unk> of <unk> .
And this is less <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world &apos;s <unk> if it &apos;s got it .
Because if I <unk> it , I &apos;m not going to talk about what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more about that .
&quot; <unk> was better when he was worse was worse , &quot; The reason he was better . &quot;
<unk> , in the world that we live -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> we can <unk> is that things are at <unk> .
You never <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> , <unk> are <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you &apos;re here is , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; Yes , you want it . &quot;
I mean -- small <unk> moment -- that I &apos;m really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn &apos;t have done better , I didn &apos;t have <unk> .
But <unk> isn &apos;t a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> when there is only that kind of <unk> is that when you &apos;re not <unk> , and I <unk> you ? &quot;
Who is <unk> ? &quot; The answer is <unk> .
The world is the <unk> . What could I do it ?
When there are hundreds of types of <unk> , and you &apos;re <unk> a <unk> , and you &apos;re <unk> who is the <unk> , it &apos;s clear that the <unk> you are .
We could have better .
With hundreds of <unk> <unk> , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people are making decisions , even though the result of <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> and they &apos;re <unk> and they &apos;re <unk> to them .
In the last few years , the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only one , but important -- of this <unk> <unk> is that people have experiences because the people have too <unk> experiences because the <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation think that <unk> is .
So the final result is that in general we &apos;re better , <unk> , but we &apos;re going to have worse .
Let me <unk> you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all get to good and is completely <unk> . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no <unk> that a little bit better than that , it &apos;s better than that , but it doesn &apos;t <unk> that much choice is better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a <unk> value , <unk> . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve <unk> from a piece of the level that the choices <unk> our lives .
Now , from <unk> &apos;s point of view -- I &apos;ve almost finished -- from a <unk> point of view , <unk> is the <unk> .
What it allows all of this choice in <unk> society is <unk> .
There are many places in the world , and you &apos;re <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that they have <unk> .
The problem is they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I &apos;m talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> talked about yesterday about how <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> are <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> of money .
I mean these choices , <unk> and <unk> , not is that they &apos;re just <unk> .
They are <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re worse .
If we &apos;re a little bit of what we &apos;re in our society allows people to have too few possibilities , it &apos;s not only their lives , it &apos;s not just their lives to <unk> , but our own .
This is what <unk> call <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of <unk> does good at all -- not just to the poor people -- not just because of this choice in <unk> that we <unk> .
And to <unk> , &quot; <unk> , you can become everything you want ,
<unk> , people of culture , they said , &quot; What is that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s <unk> that you can &apos;t <unk> anything in a glass <unk> . &quot;
&quot; A <unk> imagination , a <unk> view of the world -- &quot;
and <unk> me , I <unk> it like this , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I realized that that fish <unk> know , the long knows ,
Because the reality of the fact is that if you <unk> the <unk> , so that &quot; everything is possible , &quot; you &apos;re not <unk> the freedom . &quot;
If you <unk> the <unk> so that it &apos;s possible to <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Everybody needs a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
