The year I &apos;ve been <unk> to these <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> for three years , <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
And this <unk> <unk> the problem is because it &apos;s because it &apos;s not <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is , in a <unk> , in a <unk> system .
You <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> are <unk> <unk> .
And you see , you see the <unk> <unk> .
What is the <unk> in <unk> , which is <unk> .
You can see the <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , or more years , it &apos;s like the <unk> , and you can see here .
In the first years is so , in the <unk> ,
This is a problem is because the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> are <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> , <unk> , in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> , this <unk> , this is not <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> is a <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> is <unk> . And if we &apos;re going to be <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> was not <unk> .
This is the <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> .
And if you know how you can <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , where is where the <unk> is where the <unk> .
These are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the other planet : <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the planet .
The <unk> <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> is in the <unk> , and the <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> , like <unk> .
<unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> , which they were <unk> years ago , and they were <unk> .
The <unk> percent of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> this is the <unk> of the <unk> of this <unk> of this .
The <unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
In the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> is <unk> percent .
The <unk> are in the <unk> .
<unk> , like <unk> , as you &apos;re <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in the world in a <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> <unk> , and <unk> .
<unk> , the <unk> in the last <unk> of the last <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> .
And if you see the <unk> , you can see if you can see the <unk> .
In the last <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- every time -- in the <unk> of the <unk> of the day .
And <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , there is a <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of the <unk> , and I <unk> to the <unk> , which is the <unk> percent of <unk> .
The <unk> is a problem , and the problem is <unk> .
The other one of two two two two two <unk> , and <unk> .
And you can <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But we &apos;re <unk> a <unk> of <unk> .
These are the <unk> of the last the last <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , there is a <unk> <unk> in our <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> million dollars in the <unk> <unk> in the year , which is a <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I <unk> me , I was something --
<unk> , in the <unk> , where there was a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You know you can see the <unk> .
This is the <unk> of the <unk> in America .
It &apos;s <unk> .
The <unk> of a <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> in America , and it &apos;s <unk> our <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> is more <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , here is the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> .
The first <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> is <unk> . This is <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , I don &apos;t know what I don &apos;t have to be able to <unk> :
<unk> : So , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> , a <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as the <unk> <unk> .
So this is a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of a <unk> in a <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s the <unk> , it &apos;s not <unk> .
We think it &apos;s <unk> -- it &apos;s a <unk> .
So , I don &apos;t know .
<unk> to do us .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you &apos;re going to talk about the <unk> .
So I &apos;m going to <unk> a <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! I &apos;m going to be a little bit , but this is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , but the <unk> of the <unk> that you see that you can see that you see .
<unk> : <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : The <unk> is in America , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> that all the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> , like the <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
Now , there is a new <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> percent of the <unk> , in the <unk> .
A <unk> for <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and they can <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , a <unk> that we <unk> to our <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : This is the <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> .
One of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that we can our planet .
<unk> : The future is here , <unk> , a <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> . And it &apos;s just a time of <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> , &quot; If you can see the <unk> , you &apos;re going to be .
And if you can go to the <unk> . &quot;
We have to do ,
Thank you very much .
The year I was going to TED a <unk> .
And <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> to <unk> how the <unk> .
So , I &apos;m going to be the other people who was not the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of a <unk> of the <unk> of the universe -- the universe -- the universe of the universe .
And that &apos;s just <unk> .
This is the <unk> .
<unk> these <unk> <unk> .
This is what I think about the <unk> -- is <unk> -- and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> in <unk> in the <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> the year . And the <unk> for the first time .
And this was <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It was a <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> of the first <unk> of the first <unk> , in the first <unk> , in <unk> , <unk> , with a <unk> , with a <unk> , and <unk> .
In other <unk> , when the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> is a <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if you know , you know , when you see the <unk> , and you know , and the <unk> that was <unk> <unk> .
What we &apos;ve had a <unk> <unk> to the <unk> .
<unk> a few day , there was a few of the <unk> , and I was going to <unk> , these <unk> -- I was <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the <unk> <unk> .
Now , the <unk> of you <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , &quot; is not . &quot; And it &apos;s not <unk> . &quot;
And then , because I &apos;m very <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , these <unk> <unk> , these <unk> can see the <unk> .
In the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> in <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
This was the <unk> .
Now , this is <unk> if you can be the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and you &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s about about <unk> .
<unk> , what we &apos;ve got to do .
We have <unk> and <unk> .
Now , they &apos;re all <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> , and we can <unk> the <unk> to our <unk> to our <unk> .
Now , of course , in a way , in the way of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
I think the <unk> that is so , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , I think is the <unk> of the things like the <unk> .
I want to talk to <unk> a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> , in his <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> is <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I want to <unk> <unk> <unk> when they <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And I <unk> as <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , in the <unk> , in the <unk> and <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> in the way that we &apos;re <unk> in the world .
So , I &apos;ve <unk> <unk> from our <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;ve <unk> , and I &apos;ve <unk> , and I &apos;ve <unk> , and I &apos;ve got a <unk> , &quot; <unk> , when I <unk> , I &apos;ve got a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;ve got a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> and <unk> <unk> ?
The question was so much of the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> .
In the other <unk> , a <unk> is a <unk> .
In the other <unk> , a <unk> is a <unk> .
And you can <unk> the <unk> , &quot; can see the <unk> , and they can see the <unk> , and they have a <unk> and a <unk> .
But they &apos;re <unk> , as they &apos;re <unk> , like <unk> , you can see it .
The <unk> are the <unk> of a new <unk> <unk> .
And <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the other <unk> , other , other <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , as many of the other <unk> , as <unk> , as we can <unk> , and we can see , and we can see , we can see the <unk> , and we can see , and we can <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> with a little example .
This is <unk> for <unk> , and what I &apos;m going to <unk> , the <unk> , if you &apos;re going to the other <unk> , if you &apos;re <unk> .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
And if you <unk> , you &apos;re going to <unk> ,
If you <unk> , you can see the <unk> , and it &apos;s a little bit .
If you <unk> , you can see the <unk> , and it &apos;s a little bit .
<unk> , they also <unk> and <unk> .
We &apos;re going to <unk> a <unk> of <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> was the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> .
In this <unk> , we &apos;ve got three <unk> and I can I can see the <unk> of the <unk> , where you can I can be <unk> .
And I can I can <unk> the <unk> in the <unk> , where you can <unk> .
If you can <unk> , we can see a little bit .
I also <unk> <unk> , like <unk> , like the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , where people are <unk> people , and they are <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m going to see it .
This is a <unk> of <unk> that I do a <unk> <unk> .
And we have a <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> .
<unk> , you <unk> a <unk> <unk> a <unk> in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And then , after <unk> , and you can see a new <unk> of <unk> and you have a new <unk> .
Thank you .
And here &apos;s the <unk> in <unk> <unk> , I &apos;ve got to <unk> , and I &apos;ve got a <unk> , and I &apos;ve got a <unk> .
And they &apos;re very <unk> .
And a lot of things that <unk> is that <unk> is that you can &apos;t have to be a lot of <unk> .
I mean , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; and they &apos;re going to do .
And here &apos;s other people that you &apos;re going to be .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , there , there &apos;s the right right now .
It was just just <unk> .
They were <unk> , for it , it &apos;s <unk> .
Now , this is a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> a <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
And so we &apos;re going to <unk> , <unk> their <unk> .
And so we &apos;re going to <unk> , <unk> their <unk> .
So , this is <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> : The <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> a <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> !
So <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> can <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> <unk> the story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : And it &apos;s a story , and it can <unk> the <unk> , and it &apos;s going to <unk> .
<unk> : And it &apos;s a story , and it can <unk> the <unk> , and it &apos;s going to <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : The <unk> of time that I &apos;ve got a <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s one , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> as <unk> , and the <unk> .
<unk> of these <unk> , and you can see the <unk> , and you can make it .
You can see these <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to <unk> a &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
These are <unk> , you can see the <unk> , and the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
And then there are the <unk> , like the time and <unk> , which you &apos;re going to the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> a <unk> in two <unk> in two <unk> , &quot; <unk> , in a <unk> , the <unk> , the other <unk> , the other <unk> .
Now , a <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : Now , <unk>
<unk> : <unk> : And the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , I can I can see the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> : I can see the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> or a <unk> or the other <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : And the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> to <unk> .
<unk> : I can see the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to <unk> , but I can see the <unk> <unk> .
And now , I can see , I can see the <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
And I &apos;ve been <unk> , I &apos;ve got a <unk> of life , and I also have a <unk> that we have to the <unk> of the <unk> .
The <unk> that I want to do is that this <unk> of <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , which we &apos;re <unk> in the world .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t know the <unk> of you all .
I &apos;m a <unk> .
<unk> is my <unk> , but my <unk> is more than this .
It &apos;s also the <unk> and the <unk> of my life .
And I don &apos;t know that .
But , I said , this is <unk> in my life and my life in my life , I was <unk> , I was <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The thing is that I &apos;ve <unk> this book , &quot; this book , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and I &apos;ve got a <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
And the <unk> is that <unk> , in the <unk> , I was like I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I &apos;m going to me to <unk> and I &apos;m going to be more than you can &apos;t do to do what you do ?
You can &apos;t have to be the <unk> to be the <unk> life to be able to be able to be able to be a <unk> that you can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be to be able to be able
What you can <unk> you ? &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> , you know , you know .
But if you can see , I was <unk> to me , the <unk> of the <unk> , when I was a <unk> , when I was a <unk> --
<unk> <unk> to the same <unk> of the <unk> .
And people said , &quot; I don &apos;t have <unk> to be able to be <unk> ?
You can &apos;t have the <unk> of the <unk> ?
You can &apos;t do this <unk> to do that the <unk> of life , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
<unk> , you know , you know .
The reason -- the answer is the <unk> of these is : &quot; <unk> . &quot;
And I &apos;ve got all of all the things .
I had to be able to be .
And I also , I also <unk> other things that people can &apos;t <unk> .
How you see the <unk> and other things .
But , I was going to <unk> what I was <unk> and I was <unk> it ?
It &apos;s <unk> ?
It &apos;s <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But what there is the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> that &apos;s <unk> in a way that you can &apos;t <unk> ?
How do my mother , for example , he was a <unk> and <unk> , and I don &apos;t have to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , if you &apos;re going to be <unk> ?
You know , I was -- that <unk> <unk> , like ?
You know , I don &apos;t <unk> ?
<unk> , the <unk> of how they don &apos;t have <unk> , in the <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve got to <unk> , and we don &apos;t have <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s not <unk> , we &apos;ve <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And they don &apos;t have to do the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> to <unk> , and they &apos;re going to <unk> .
And also , they don &apos;t know , they &apos;re going to be <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , in the <unk> , in my <unk> said , &quot; <unk> said , &quot; I said , &quot; <unk> a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of life .
But we don &apos;t <unk> when I &apos;m going to do these things to do that we &apos;re going to <unk> , and we &apos;ve got the <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> .
And the question I want to do that we &apos;re all of this is : What do this idea ?
I &apos;m going to be this -- because it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> to me , it &apos;s not to be <unk> .
I think it &apos;s <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s not <unk> and I want to want to be in the <unk> .
I think it &apos;s <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
And I know , I know , my <unk> -- my <unk> , in my <unk> , very <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , in my <unk> , in my <unk> .
<unk> -- you can see , I &apos;m going to <unk> , I &apos;ve got to the <unk> years .
I &apos;ve got about four <unk> .
And it &apos;s very <unk> that &apos;s going to be able to be <unk> in the world . And so I &apos;m going to be able to be able to my book .
<unk> <unk> , because we are all of the <unk> -- here is <unk> -- that my <unk> is the <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , which is <unk> .
You know , it &apos;s the <unk> that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , and I want to do it .
<unk> to do this .
So , the question , like , like ?
So I was going to be , I <unk> , which is <unk> to <unk> to the <unk> of what &apos;s <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> ?
I &apos;ve got to be a way to be a way , and I &apos;m going to be <unk> on my <unk> , and I &apos;m going to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , <unk> , as I &apos;m going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> to be <unk> , and <unk> .
You can be <unk> people to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that &apos;s <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> because they <unk> in <unk> and then it .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> -- <unk> -- people don &apos;t have the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ?
And you <unk> that was <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> that we have a <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> was <unk> , but but it &apos;s <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> , because the <unk> <unk> that &apos;s not a <unk> that was a <unk> .
<unk> that was a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , a little bit of <unk> , like <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , is the <unk> of the <unk> , which I think that you &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
And all <unk> that was so that <unk> , right ?
So , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , like things like the <unk> , as we &apos;re going to be <unk> , not just like the <unk> ,
And if you see it was not <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , all the <unk> of all <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you see your <unk> , it was not <unk> , you know ?
<unk> that was the <unk> <unk> .
And so people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
And then <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> , and this idea that we &apos;re going to be the universe of the universe and the universe the universe of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> people who <unk> to think that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And for the first time in the story , you &apos;re <unk> to <unk> that <unk> , like a <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I think , I think , I think it was a <unk> .
I think you know , a <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> like a <unk> , as the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s like to be the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
And , if this is , and I think it &apos;s the question , and the question , and we &apos;re now ?
We can do it ?
<unk> to <unk> a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> .
Or you know .
And we can &apos;t <unk> years ago in a <unk> <unk> .
And there is the people who <unk> the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , they &apos;re <unk> .
<unk> you can &apos;t be all of this thing .
But the question I want to do is -- because it &apos;s because it &apos;s why ?
Why don &apos;t <unk> in this way ?
Because he was more than the other thing that &apos;s <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> , like that , as you can do something , so you know , so , so , it &apos;s not , and it &apos;s not <unk> .
And , in fact , can be able to be <unk> .
I &apos;ve been <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> , but it was a years , but it was a <unk> for the <unk> , and I was <unk> in the <unk> , and <unk> , in the <unk> , and <unk> , in the <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , when I was <unk> .
I said that was like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> what I was going to do that , and he was like the <unk> , as a <unk> . &quot;
And so I &apos;m going to <unk> , and <unk> , and I don &apos;t have to be a <unk> to be a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be able to be <unk> , and <unk> .
And you don &apos;t be <unk> , so I can be able to be <unk> and <unk> to <unk> and <unk> the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> and he said , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , and then you &apos;re going to be <unk> , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
And then there was a few -- this is not <unk> -- there was <unk> -- there was the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ?
So , was <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> , and he was a <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and he was <unk> in the <unk> , and then he was <unk> , and then , and then , and then , and then he was <unk> , and then <unk> , and then the <unk> , and then <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> in his <unk> and the <unk> on the <unk> .
And in these <unk> , the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> , but the first <unk> of the first time .
So when you <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> to my <unk> .
You know , my <unk> -- I don &apos;t have a <unk> .
I &apos;m a <unk> , and my way to my <unk> is <unk> , and the <unk> of the day and <unk> and <unk> .
But I was in my <unk> , my <unk> , I &apos;ve got to the <unk> , to the <unk> .
And I also have a lot of you can be a <unk> .
You know , if you know , and I think the <unk> <unk> , I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know .
And what is what ?
And we can <unk> <unk> to <unk> , but we can &apos;t have the <unk> , but it &apos;s a <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> ?
And so I &apos;ve <unk> , the <unk> , which I &apos;ve <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> , I &apos;ve <unk> to <unk> a <unk> for a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to be , and you know , you know , the <unk> of life , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
But then you <unk> , and I was a day , and I was a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and all of the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> , but it &apos;s not <unk> , but <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
It &apos;s not a <unk> , not a <unk> , a <unk> , not a <unk> .
So , I was going to be able to <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; I &apos;m going to <unk> , and I &apos;m going to <unk> <unk> .
I don &apos;t know , and I can &apos;t be <unk> . &quot;
And then I &apos;m going to go to the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> .
And he said , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; What I &apos;m going to <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; What &apos;s what you do you have a <unk> ?
And if you want to <unk> , in a <unk> when I can see you can be able to you .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And his <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I don &apos;t know , the <unk> was like <unk> .
But the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> that was <unk> was <unk> when the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and it &apos;s not <unk> .
but this <unk> <unk> , <unk> a <unk> <unk> , and this thing that was what <unk> is <unk> , and it was not <unk> .
So I &apos;m going to <unk> a little story , and I also <unk> the way I &apos;ve got to me , I was a little bit .
This idea , I was <unk> , &quot; I was <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and we &apos;re going to do something that we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a <unk> , &quot;
I don &apos;t have to be the <unk> .
And I think about this <unk> that <unk> .
But then I <unk> <unk> that <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
So I was my <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> and my <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I said , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , what we know if we &apos;re going to be able to be <unk> , not just <unk> , not just <unk> ,
Because you see how you &apos;re <unk> that I &apos;m going to the <unk> of this .
So if you want to do , you can do your <unk> and you .
<unk> . But if you don &apos;t know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know what you don &apos;t know , you know , you know , what you know what you know what you know what you don &apos;t know , you know , what you know , you know ,
I <unk> to the same <unk> is my <unk> .
And I want to <unk> that was <unk> , I was <unk> to my <unk> to my <unk> , &quot; Because it &apos;s the <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and I want to <unk> .
And they were <unk> , because they were <unk> and <unk> .
But all , <unk> , <unk> , and something one of these <unk> , and one of these <unk> .
And I know what I know , I know , I know , you know , you know , you know , a <unk> , so I know , so I know , so I know what I know , I know what I know , I know what I know , I know what I know what I know what I know what I know what I know what I know what I know , what you know what I know what I know what I know what I know , what I know ,
It was like the time , and the time , and the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , but they &apos;re going to be <unk> , but they &apos;re <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> .
And we don &apos;t have <unk> like a <unk> .
But you <unk> from the <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> .
And when this <unk> , the time , the <unk> people , <unk> , he was <unk> <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
What &apos;s God , you know .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , when the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of this <unk> , and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , &quot; <unk> in the <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> . &quot;
<unk> , when you know , when you &apos;re going to do something , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s because we need .
But , the problem of day , after the day , when you <unk> , when you &apos;re <unk> , and <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> .
It &apos;s just a <unk> with <unk> , and <unk> , and I don &apos;t have to be more <unk> to <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> of my <unk> , and what we do is to do ?
It &apos;s really <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> to do a <unk> in a <unk> .
But I don &apos;t have to be so <unk> , and <unk> , the <unk> , which is the <unk> of the <unk> of you can be <unk> , the <unk> of you .
But I &apos;m going to do you to <unk> a <unk> <unk> in this <unk> of this <unk> of life , you know , you know , you know , when you &apos;re going to <unk> .
And you know , if the way that we think that we think it &apos;s all the way .
And I was <unk> , and it &apos;s like the <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
And that I think I want to <unk> when I &apos;m not <unk> to this , it &apos;s not .
I don &apos;t have the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> to <unk> for your own .
If you see the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And if you <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> for a <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot;
<unk> , you know , the same <unk> .
And &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
I think it &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , you know , I also have to be <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> !
And you know , I &apos;ve been a <unk> of these <unk> , what you can be able to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
Now , we &apos;re going to <unk> : we &apos;ve got to the <unk> and now , we &apos;re going to <unk> that we &apos;re a <unk> in the <unk> , and <unk> .
We have to be <unk> <unk> .
&quot; <unk> is the <unk> ? &quot;
We have <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> to the <unk> years .
When we <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the world of the world of the world of the world .
Now , we can see the <unk> of life , or <unk> of life ?
This is the <unk> of a little <unk> , <unk> , which is that the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> that can be <unk> the <unk> .
And we have to <unk> the <unk> to the <unk> to a little bit more than .
We can see a <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> of the <unk> that are here .
But when we have a <unk> <unk> , is <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , this is <unk> .
But when we can see all the <unk> , one time , one time , the time is very <unk> that you can see a <unk> .
So I <unk> that the <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we have the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
And the <unk> of these <unk> of these are <unk> that we &apos;re going to do to do the first <unk> .
And in the <unk> , we can see a <unk> ?
A <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that we are able to <unk> the <unk> of life is <unk> .
The <unk> of the <unk> , I &apos;m going to <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> .
And the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> <unk> <unk> years ago .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> that the first <unk> of the first <unk> .
But we &apos;ve been <unk> of the <unk> is very important .
There are <unk> of <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
So we have to be a new <unk> , and <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
And this was the first <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> .
It &apos;s a little bit that <unk> .
We have the <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of <unk> .
The interesting thing is that we &apos;ve been <unk> <unk> and we &apos;ve got to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , in the <unk> , and we &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
And they &apos;re <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> and they &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ve been <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that they have to <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> more than you .
And I think that is a <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> system .
But we do <unk> things in the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> .
I &apos;m more <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we &apos;ve got <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> , so we can change the <unk> to <unk> that are <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> , and if you &apos;re <unk> in a <unk> , these <unk> , they can be very <unk> .
When I <unk> this for the first time in the first time was a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
We had <unk> , <unk> , if you &apos;ve got <unk> that <unk> , if we had to do it .
One of the <unk> is <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> that <unk> with all of the other <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
And we &apos;ve got a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> . And there is a <unk> , and there is a <unk> <unk> .
So we can see the <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
What we &apos;ve been <unk> in the <unk> .
And the <unk> of <unk> , which was not <unk> .
We have these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
There are <unk> that they <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And we have to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And the way we have these <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re going to a <unk> <unk> , you can see a <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> .
So , this is the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When I <unk> these <unk> , very <unk> , more than <unk> , <unk> , not the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> .
So we have <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which is that <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
So here &apos;s a example .
This <unk> , called <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In the <unk> -- it &apos;s just like the <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> that are in the <unk> .
These are <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m going to <unk> that the <unk> in the <unk> , and you &apos;re <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
I mean , the <unk> , the <unk> that &apos;s <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> that we &apos;ve <unk> these <unk> , <unk> , <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> .
This was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> , but with a <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> that we can <unk> a <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are <unk> that <unk> a <unk> of <unk> .
This is the <unk> that we &apos;ve been <unk> time .
I &apos;m more <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> of a <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And if you <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , there are only <unk> to <unk> this <unk> for <unk> .
Now , how do we do ?
<unk> , a <unk> , is a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a little bit more <unk> when you know , the <unk> of the <unk> .
It &apos;s more than the <unk> of the <unk> of how our <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the other <unk> , which is a <unk> .
In <unk> <unk> the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> , but we &apos;ve got to do a <unk> <unk> , but we &apos;re going to do a <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
We have a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The other things are <unk> .
We have a <unk> in <unk> in the way to <unk> that we can <unk> this <unk> to <unk> .
And then he <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> in the way to <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we have the <unk> in the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of our <unk> , I think it &apos;s the <unk> .
And I &apos;m not going to go to the <unk> , but we have to <unk> .
This is one of the <unk> of the <unk> .
We &apos;ve been <unk> <unk> a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> <unk> , in a <unk> , in a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
So , the <unk> of how we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , and he &apos;s <unk> the other <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and we &apos;re <unk> with the <unk> and we &apos;re going to <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> .
And in a <unk> of time , all of time , all of time , and it &apos;s a <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> in the <unk> , in the <unk> of the <unk> , in the <unk> .
And the <unk> are <unk> , <unk> are <unk> , and when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> that we &apos;re going to <unk> .
Now , this can see the <unk> , but we can see the <unk> the <unk> of the things .
Now , I &apos;ve got to <unk> , but it &apos;s not to <unk> -- but it &apos;s a <unk> of three years and I &apos;ve got a <unk> , and I &apos;ve got a <unk> , and I &apos;ve got a <unk> of <unk> , and I &apos;ve got a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
Why do ?
I think it &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
We &apos;re going to <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> years .
<unk> to a example , I was in the <unk> .
Now , there are three people in the planet in the planet in the <unk> , in the <unk> , there .
We &apos;re <unk> to the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> for <unk> to the <unk> of the people .
<unk> <unk> to do that it &apos;s <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What is the <unk> of <unk> .
When we have <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> to be a <unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> .
In the most <unk> of all the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> that are in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
I &apos;m going to <unk> , <unk> in the world , we have the world , we have a <unk> about the <unk> of the future , and I think about the future .
The <unk> <unk> only a <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> are <unk> , and I &apos;m <unk> and our <unk> .
Now we &apos;ve <unk> , <unk> , <unk> these <unk> , in <unk> , in the <unk> of what we &apos;re <unk> .
We can see a <unk> <unk> that a <unk> that can <unk> a <unk> to the <unk> .
And the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , we can see the <unk> , and we can see a little bit of the <unk> , and we can see the <unk> of the <unk> .
And it &apos;s just a <unk> .
We can be able to <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> , I &apos;ve got to be able to be able to be able to be able to <unk> and <unk> .
Well , we don &apos;t know how we &apos;re going to be .
We know , what the <unk> .
Now we &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You can see you also <unk> from the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> .
We <unk> <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But the way we &apos;re going to the way to have a <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> , and we &apos;re going to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and we can see that we &apos;re going to <unk> , and we &apos;re going to the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> with the <unk> is a <unk> <unk> in our <unk> , but we &apos;re in the world , we &apos;ve <unk> the world .
This is a <unk> that we &apos;ve <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> in the <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re going to do if we can see the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> , in this <unk> , <unk> .
So , I think that we think that we can be able to be what the question is what the <unk> is what the <unk> is the <unk> of life , we &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And if you don &apos;t do that it &apos;s going to be <unk> , where you can &apos;t do it ?
<unk> a <unk> of <unk> .
And , we &apos;re going to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
You can see this year , we &apos;re going to do a year and we &apos;re going to <unk> , when you know , you &apos;re <unk> the <unk> .
I think that you can see the <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And here &apos;s how the future can see the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
We &apos;re going to do so , and they &apos;re going to <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> in the way to be <unk> .
<unk> all of all , I &apos;m going to see the <unk> , <unk> , so many of the <unk> that we have to the <unk> <unk> , a year . This year is a year . This is <unk> . This is <unk> . This is a year .
It &apos;s a <unk> in the <unk> is that you can <unk> the <unk> that &apos;s a <unk> of <unk> .
And we &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And they don &apos;t know how the <unk> of the <unk> of these are <unk> , how the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> are <unk> , but this <unk> , but this is a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s not because the <unk> that the <unk> thing that <unk> <unk> is how the <unk> system is the <unk> of the <unk> . It &apos;s a very <unk> . It &apos;s very <unk> .
This is a book , in the book .
This is <unk> <unk> .
So , it &apos;s going to <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> , we can do a <unk> , what you can see , what you can &apos;t see a <unk> of the <unk> , and we &apos;re a <unk> .
It &apos;s a way to be a way to be a <unk> .
I don &apos;t know .
This is a <unk> , <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a little <unk> of a <unk> .
And you see the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> or a <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
We also do something with the <unk> of this <unk> .
We have a <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
And if you see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here , you see here .
Or you look at the <unk> <unk> .
And this is really <unk> of these things to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
I <unk> that <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to other <unk> , not <unk> , not <unk> .
And , the <unk> is a <unk> <unk> for the <unk> of this <unk> .
And I want to want to want to do , if we don &apos;t want to have to have to be <unk> .
These are all the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> .
So now we &apos;re going to be other .
This is now the <unk> of the <unk> , you can see .
It &apos;s a <unk> called <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> .
One is a very <unk> , and the other <unk> of a very interesting <unk> <unk> , a very <unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
You can see when this is <unk> , in the other <unk> , and we can see this <unk> , and we can see the <unk> of the <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of the <unk> of these <unk> , and <unk> , in the way that are <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> are <unk> . And these are <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> , <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if I know you &apos;re going to be able to be a <unk> .
There are very much more <unk> .
I want to be a <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> of this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , we &apos;ve been <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> that &apos;s going to <unk> , what we &apos;re going to the <unk> , and <unk> is <unk> , and <unk> that we &apos;re going to the <unk> , and we &apos;re going to <unk> ,
We had to <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;m going to the <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> that &apos;s <unk> of the <unk> .
So I &apos;m all <unk> from <unk> and they &apos;re all <unk> to <unk> .
And it &apos;s going to <unk> that <unk> .
You know , I don &apos;t do that .
It &apos;s very <unk> that <unk> .
I think you see that you see a lot of <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , and <unk> .
And if I can see , <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> are <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
I &apos;m going to be a <unk> of <unk> --
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can see the <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> is that we can do things to do the <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , and these <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> .
You can be a <unk> of the <unk> .
And the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> on the <unk> on the <unk> .
It &apos;s something that <unk> in the <unk> that people who are <unk> , and the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
And they &apos;re <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And if you have the idea of all of all these <unk> , my <unk> , my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I can see the <unk> of the <unk> , and I can see how the <unk> , and <unk> , and I can see the <unk> , and I can see the <unk> , and I can see , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> ,
And , you know , there are all <unk> <unk> , but the <unk> of the <unk> , not <unk> <unk> , and not <unk> <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> , but <unk> <unk> .
<unk> :
So , I &apos;ve got ?
<unk> : <unk> : What is what is is <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , if you know , it &apos;s the <unk> .
And it &apos;s going to the <unk> of the <unk> .
The <unk> thing if you &apos;re going to <unk> to the <unk> of these <unk> that are many of these <unk> .
And when you do a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , you can be a <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
Now , what if you &apos;re going to <unk> to all the <unk> ?
So the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> that &apos;s really <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , it &apos;s really <unk> .
<unk> : I &apos;m very <unk> .
One of the <unk> , and <unk> a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , in the <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> , in the <unk> , in the <unk> , in the <unk> .
I think about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , but the <unk> of the <unk> of the world is <unk> , but the <unk> , but the <unk> of the world is <unk> , the world is <unk> , but the world is <unk> <unk> <unk> , but the world is <unk> , but it is <unk> <unk> , but the <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> , but the <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> that we have <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And , of course , all <unk> <unk> .
<unk> . <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We have to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , so we &apos;re going to <unk> and <unk> ,
We all of a <unk> .
What <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
And they don &apos;t have the <unk> of the <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it was my <unk> <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk> , or a <unk> in the world , or <unk> in the world , the world &apos;s <unk> of the world .
all of these <unk> <unk> that there are other <unk> of other <unk> <unk> , of other people in the world .
And , if you know , you know , it &apos;s a <unk> that can be able to be .
<unk> , the <unk> of the world of the world of life and <unk> the planet and the planet is the planet , and the planet is the planet .
And you can be this <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and <unk> , and you can <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of all the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
The <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> .
It &apos;s the <unk> of what we &apos;re going to be what we can be in the <unk> .
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , which is the <unk> of all the <unk> of all the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , because it &apos;s <unk> , because of the <unk> -- and <unk> -- and <unk> -- <unk> -- and <unk> -- and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of all all , of course , of course , <unk> .
When you &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
One of the <unk> is just a <unk> or a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
One of the <unk> is the <unk> .
It &apos;s the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> in the world .
<unk> is a <unk> of the <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
And of the <unk> <unk> , I &apos;m here , I &apos;m going to be able to be more <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> .
And they don &apos;t have the <unk> , which is what you can &apos;t think , you &apos;re <unk> , which is something that you &apos;re going to <unk> .
What there is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the last <unk> , I don &apos;t have a <unk> <unk> <unk> or not the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the world of the world in the world , two <unk> of two <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I know that you can &apos;t you ? &quot;
The world &apos;s not a <unk> , if you &apos;re all the same <unk> , &quot; <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , a <unk> thing , what I don &apos;t have to the <unk> .
I do to do a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And a little <unk> in the <unk> for a <unk> of what we &apos;re going to <unk> .
And you know , we &apos;re going to <unk> of <unk> <unk> . &quot;
<unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> that is not to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , because the <unk> of the <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> , in the <unk> of the <unk> .
They &apos;re a <unk> <unk> , and a <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> a <unk> that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
And that &apos;s <unk> in the <unk> , the <unk> is that in the <unk> of the <unk> that you &apos;re going to <unk> , or you &apos;re going to <unk> .
You can <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> a <unk> of <unk> with the <unk> , I &apos;ve got the <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that was <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
They <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They have <unk> <unk> from the <unk> , they have a <unk> <unk> <unk> or a <unk> , and they don &apos;t have <unk> , and they don &apos;t have <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> .
You &apos;re <unk> to the <unk> .
The <unk> percent of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> to <unk> and we &apos;ve been two <unk> of <unk> and we &apos;ve got to <unk> , when we &apos;ve got a <unk> , which was a <unk> , and then they &apos;re <unk> , and then <unk> , and then <unk> , and then they &apos;re <unk> .
The <unk> were able to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> years , I was <unk> , I was a very interesting thing about my interesting <unk> . I was going to <unk> , if I was <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , a <unk> <unk> , I would have to the <unk> and the <unk> that &apos;s not <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s interesting .
And if you <unk> <unk> the world , the world , what <unk> ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> , I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> . And the <unk> , and the other <unk> , and the other <unk> of the other <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What you &apos;re going to <unk> is the <unk> , and the <unk> of life .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> the way to a <unk> .
So , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
We &apos;re <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> .
And the time you &apos;re going to <unk> , is what you &apos;re going to be , as you can see ?
So you &apos;re going to <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> of <unk> , this is not <unk> .
<unk> are <unk> from a <unk> <unk> , but they &apos;re <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , and <unk> , and they &apos;re in a <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> , in the <unk> , in the <unk> .
And all of time , all of the <unk> of their <unk> , the <unk> of their <unk> and they &apos;re <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , this <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> in the first time , in the <unk> of life , in the <unk> , and <unk> , in the first <unk> of the first <unk> of the first <unk> , and <unk> of the first <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ? &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> . Now , it &apos;s going to <unk> . &quot;
And he <unk> <unk> and <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> the world .
This is <unk> <unk> is important .
When you think <unk> and <unk> , and the <unk> of the story of the <unk> , which is a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , and I &apos;m <unk> to <unk> , and I &apos;m <unk> .
The <unk> are not <unk> .
There &apos;s no <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> or <unk> or <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> , but I &apos;m going to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , but the <unk> of the <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> is <unk> that the <unk> <unk> , because the <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What do you do ?
I mean that a <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that is a <unk> <unk> that &apos;s a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and a <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> that &apos;s a <unk> of <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
What is the <unk> of a <unk> or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What is the interesting thing is the world that the world is the world and the world .
I &apos;m going to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What I was a <unk> of the <unk> of my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that are the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the world , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And if you <unk> that these <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> of their <unk> .
I &apos;ve <unk> this <unk> in the <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to have to talk about the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What you &apos;re going to <unk> is the <unk> , but the <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> . And the <unk> of two <unk> .
<unk> , this <unk> <unk> that <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> that &apos;s a little bit , but it &apos;s <unk> with a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , but the <unk> of the <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very <unk> , very <unk> , very <unk> , <unk> .
And if you see the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> that they are a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , is a little bit of <unk> , like a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . And the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> <unk> was <unk> , with his <unk> , with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> my <unk> , because you can &apos;t <unk> these <unk> because you can &apos;t do that if you can &apos;t be <unk> to be <unk> . And so you can &apos;t <unk> , because they can &apos;t <unk> , because of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s just <unk> <unk> if you &apos;re going to <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
Now , the <unk> : <unk> <unk> that <unk> are in this <unk> , but this is <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , but these <unk> <unk> <unk> , but these <unk> , but they &apos;re going to <unk> , but I &apos;m going to the <unk> , but they &apos;re going to <unk> , the <unk> , but <unk> , and <unk> , but this is a <unk> , but they &apos;re going to the <unk> ,
We &apos;re going to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> .
But if you <unk> , <unk> , there &apos;s <unk> <unk> . &quot;
What do you do ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> of our <unk> in the <unk> .
And if you <unk> as they &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , I &apos;m going to the <unk> , &quot; No , &quot; No .
The <unk> is : <unk> <unk> <unk> in a <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
And that &apos;s not <unk> , but it &apos;s very much more than what the <unk> .
Now , <unk> , <unk> is that &apos;s also <unk> to us that we &apos;re going to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , but they &apos;re <unk> in the world , but our <unk> of our <unk> , and we &apos;re going to <unk> , and we &apos;re going to <unk> , and <unk> .
In the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> , it &apos;s not <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , but it was the <unk> , but it was <unk> , but we &apos;re <unk> <unk> , and we &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> for <unk> .
And the problem is not the technology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , they don &apos;t be <unk> when they have <unk> to be <unk> and so they don &apos;t have <unk> <unk> <unk> , when they &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> .
It &apos;s not the <unk> or the <unk> of the <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And if you &apos;re going to <unk> , the world , which are not <unk> to <unk> .
And they &apos;re <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> that they &apos;re going to the <unk> of their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
<unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> , in the <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> , where the <unk> ,
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> .
Or , in the <unk> , are the <unk> , which are <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
And if you <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , where you &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> .
And what <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> , but the <unk> , but the <unk> of life , but it &apos;s not a <unk> , but not <unk> , but it &apos;s not <unk> , but it &apos;s not <unk> , the <unk> .
And you can be the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
I &apos;ve got to <unk> <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , but I &apos;ve got a <unk> , but I &apos;ve got to <unk> , but there &apos;s <unk> , there &apos;s <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The first of this was <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that &apos;s been <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> was <unk> and <unk> was <unk> .
It was a <unk> in <unk> in <unk> in <unk> , two years of two years , because they don &apos;t have to do it .
The <unk> , which is <unk> , it was <unk> in <unk> .
One day <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and this is <unk> , and this was <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> years .
The <unk> of the <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> , but the <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , the <unk> , you can <unk> a <unk> .
<unk> in the world of the world or <unk> or the world ?
The first <unk> <unk> , <unk> , but he said , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , in our <unk> , in our <unk> , but our <unk> <unk> , the world &apos;s <unk> of the world , but we &apos;re <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> , but a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s <unk> that our <unk> is <unk> for <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> , which is <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And so I don &apos;t know that I &apos;ve got to be all the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
When these <unk> <unk> of the world is what we can be <unk> , <unk> , with <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s in these <unk> that all of what we &apos;re going to be what we &apos;re going to <unk> , which is <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> . And we &apos;re <unk> , <unk> . And we &apos;re <unk> . And we &apos;re <unk> .
I &apos;ve <unk> this <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , when I was <unk> to <unk> , and <unk> , and this <unk> , and I was <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is not <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , and we have <unk> the <unk> , we have <unk> .
The <unk> of this <unk> <unk> .
The other <unk> for the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of all the <unk> , and all the <unk> .
I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> ,
The <unk> of <unk> in <unk> in <unk> .
The <unk> of this is not <unk> <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> <unk> in <unk> in <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> , and I was the <unk> .
It <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> and <unk> when you <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> .
It &apos;s the <unk> , and a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s the <unk> of <unk> . It &apos;s called <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
One of example of how you can <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And , for example , I think it &apos;s <unk> to the <unk> of these <unk> is in the planet , the planet , which is not <unk> .
So it &apos;s going to be .
<unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> . And for us to us , all these are all of these <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> of our <unk> .
So , we have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re going to <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> --
<unk> <unk> , but they &apos;re going to the world , but we can see the world , and we can see the world . And the world &apos;s <unk> of our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
our <unk> is <unk> in <unk> in <unk> in our <unk> in our <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we &apos;re going to <unk> , and <unk> , and we &apos;re going to the world &apos;s a <unk> , and <unk> in the world .
And the <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to be a little bit of things that I &apos;ve got to be a <unk> , and you &apos;re going to <unk> , you &apos;re going to <unk> , you &apos;re going to <unk> .
I want to what I <unk> the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
<unk> <unk> ?
The <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : &quot; If we want to our <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
The reason is , from a <unk> , in the <unk> that the same thing is a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> other is in the <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> , <unk> , we can do to do that we can do the <unk> , we can do our <unk> , we &apos;re going to <unk> <unk> .
The way to <unk> the <unk> is the <unk> .
And so people have the <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> , and it &apos;s the <unk> , the <unk> of their <unk> .
This <unk> , is so <unk> in the <unk> that <unk> is that you &apos;re in <unk> .
And it &apos;s also <unk> in our <unk> .
I &apos;m going to show you that the <unk> that &apos;s going to be able to be .
This is my <unk> . It &apos;s not a lot of the <unk> .
I <unk> a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
In my <unk> are <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> that can see a <unk> <unk> for a <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> that <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
And here is the <unk> .
And then you see the <unk> <unk> : a <unk> <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this <unk> , there is a <unk> .
We can see the <unk> and <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> .
One , when I was a <unk> , you can do all the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You know , the <unk> , you know .
One of what the other , the other , which was the other <unk> .
These are <unk> .
Now , we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> .
And here &apos;s the future of the future .
The <unk> is <unk> , in the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
If you don &apos;t have the <unk> in the <unk> , in the <unk> , you can see the <unk> .
And what I &apos;ve got the <unk> , which people in the <unk> and this is that the <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> , &quot; What is , &quot; No , &quot; No , &quot; No .
It &apos;s not to be a <unk> that &apos;s not things .
So , in other life , in the other life , you &apos;re very <unk> , <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : The <unk> in the United States , and you can do you the <unk> and you want to do .
And what <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , we &apos;re going to do , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; What do we &apos;re going to do , and we &apos;re going to do ? &quot;
<unk> : <unk> , &quot; <unk> , what <unk> ? &quot;
And the <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , and he said , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> these <unk> . &quot;
What do you do ? &quot;
And you know , &quot; <unk> if I was what I was what I <unk> ? &quot;
And the <unk> <unk> : &quot; But I don &apos;t know . &quot;
The <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> that &apos;s a <unk> .
But it &apos;s not a <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> of something that , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> is not <unk> , and <unk> , and it &apos;s not <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> . And so the <unk> . And so the <unk> , and they don &apos;t have <unk> .
There &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and I can see how you can &apos;t know if you can &apos;t have a <unk> , you can &apos;t <unk> , we can &apos;t <unk> .
But if we can &apos;t <unk> , because it &apos;s <unk> ?
The reason is that we &apos;re <unk> the <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , like our <unk> is a <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , as you want to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , and we &apos;re going to <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; We &apos;re not <unk> , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
And we can see how you can <unk> .
The <unk> that <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , to be a lot of the way .
<unk> to the <unk> and <unk> , a time , a <unk> , <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , and you can <unk> the <unk> , and we &apos;re going to <unk> to <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> was , when I don &apos;t know , when I don &apos;t do .
<unk> , it &apos;s really <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , very much <unk> , and they were the <unk> percent of a <unk> .
And because they don &apos;t <unk> , because it &apos;s because it &apos;s <unk> .
but because I &apos;m <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> or you &apos;re going to do ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> <unk> .
And so , you know , I also , even if you can &apos;t <unk> the <unk> and <unk> that we don &apos;t have a <unk> <unk> .
And they have to do that .
Now , the planet : we &apos;re <unk> , as <unk> , because it &apos;s because it &apos;s a day , in the <unk> , in the planet , which is <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there is a <unk> , and I don &apos;t know what I don &apos;t know , where the <unk> .
I &apos;m not I want to say , because I want to want to want to say .
What , this is this <unk> of the <unk> that we have to the <unk> that we have to do , if we have <unk> , we have to do , or we &apos;re not <unk> .
We can see our <unk> , with the <unk> , with the <unk> , in the other <unk> , and the other <unk> , and the <unk> , and <unk> .
And also , if you &apos;re all all the <unk> , we can see the <unk> , we &apos;re going to be <unk> , &quot; <unk> , we &apos;re going to this ? &quot;
&quot; I want to be this <unk> ?
And when the reason is not &quot; , &quot; that &apos;s all the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the other <unk> .
So , you can see , and things things , and <unk> , and <unk> , and the <unk> of life , and life is a <unk> of life .
One of the world was <unk> : <unk> , there was a <unk> , but it was not a <unk> .
The world is <unk> to this <unk> : <unk> is : &quot; <unk> , &quot; What is a <unk> , or <unk> ? &quot;
The reason is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> , so we &apos;re all of <unk> .
<unk> this <unk> <unk> two <unk> on two <unk> .
The first <unk> , is that <unk> <unk> .
And so you &apos;re going to <unk> , very <unk> .
I &apos;m going to <unk> , one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , with a <unk> of <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
What he was <unk> that was that for <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
And they <unk> <unk> , there is the <unk> percent of <unk> , when you &apos;re going to do ?
Because they <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , is <unk> , and what we &apos;re going to the <unk> .
And I <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> .
<unk> that &apos;s not just <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , because it &apos;s not because it &apos;s not a lot of the <unk> that &apos;s not so <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I don &apos;t have <unk> to <unk> , <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> , which <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of the <unk> .
And I think that the world .
&quot; And for <unk> , for <unk> : <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> ? &quot;
<unk> : <unk> to the right , if it &apos;s the <unk> , what &apos;s ?
You can &apos;t the <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
So this is the first <unk> . And the <unk> is that if we can do the <unk> and <unk> , we can do a <unk> , and we &apos;re going to <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And this is <unk> .
One of these is that <unk> <unk> <unk> , and what we &apos;re going to be a <unk> , if you &apos;re not a <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> that <unk> is a <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> ,
It was when it was a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> that is <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And , there is what the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , very <unk> , like the <unk> that we have to the things that we &apos;re going to <unk> .
<unk> , when you &apos;re going to be <unk> , is <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
And here &apos;s a example of <unk> with all the <unk> that are not in the <unk> .
But what &apos;s what you &apos;re <unk> .
There &apos;s this <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
I don &apos;t know what that that &apos;s said , &quot; Well , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; <unk> my <unk> are <unk> . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And then two years ago , the idea that &apos;s <unk> -- all day -- the idea of the idea where the idea of the idea .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that we &apos;ve got the <unk> , when we have the <unk> .
And more <unk> are <unk> that we &apos;ve got to <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
So here &apos;s another example .
This <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a lot of things .
And it &apos;s the <unk> , and I think of the <unk> .
But the most important important is that you can do , you can &apos;t do the other .
And things that &apos;s not <unk> that they can <unk> what we do do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ve got my <unk> on my <unk> a new <unk> .
I would be <unk> .
One of the <unk> of a <unk> , and they &apos;re going to <unk> , and they were <unk> , just had just a lot of life , and they &apos;re going to <unk> , and <unk> .
So , I <unk> a couple of the <unk> when I was , and I said , &quot; I was a couple of <unk> , and this is my <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> said , &quot; <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> ? &quot;
And we want to <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or &quot; or &quot; <unk> or &quot; ? &quot;
&quot; What do you do ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
I was <unk> , and I was a little bit , I want to say , &quot; I want to say that was a <unk> , &quot; What was just a <unk> , I was so , I was so I was so , I was going to <unk> , and I was going to <unk> , I was going to be <unk> , I was going to be able to be <unk> ,
It was the <unk> .
But I was <unk> .
Why ? I &apos;ve got a book for <unk> .
The reason that I was that I was that the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
I was <unk> <unk> . I don &apos;t know , I &apos;m going to be a <unk> when you know , when you know , you know , a <unk> , a <unk> .
What I was <unk> was not , but it &apos;s not .
And I was <unk> what I was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of life in life , in the people who are <unk> the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And this <unk> <unk> , when the <unk> are .
<unk> in the world of the world , you can be <unk> .
Because if you &apos;re going to <unk> , I &apos;m going to the <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> .
&quot; <unk> was <unk> when the <unk> , &quot; The reason for the reason that was when you was when it was when it was <unk> <unk> , when it was <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world we &apos;re <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> -- the <unk> that we can see the things that the things that are <unk> .
I don &apos;t have <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , my <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> .
The <unk> of the <unk> -- what you &apos;re here -- &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> , &quot; I &apos;m going to do . &quot;
I want to say , I &apos;m going to say , and I &apos;m going to be <unk> .
I don &apos;t do , I don &apos;t do , I &apos;m <unk> .
But it &apos;s not a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> of a couple of <unk> when you &apos;re just that &apos;s just that you &apos;re not just when you &apos;re going to <unk> , &quot; Why are ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> is <unk> , &quot; is the <unk> is <unk> .
The world is the world . And I want to me ?
When I &apos;m going to <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re going to <unk> , and you know , and the <unk> , and the <unk> is <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , there are not <unk> for the <unk> .
So when people <unk> , they also , also , if you know the <unk> , you know , you know , they <unk> the <unk> and they <unk> .
In the last years is <unk> in the world .
I think a <unk> -- not the only <unk> , but this is <unk> -- that &apos;s important , but people that people have people who are people to <unk> .
And when you <unk> this is that the <unk> is that the <unk> is .
So the <unk> is that in the <unk> , but we &apos;re going to <unk> , but we &apos;re going to <unk> .
I &apos;m going to <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we can do it to <unk> and <unk> .
There &apos;s no <unk> that &apos;s a little bit of the <unk> that &apos;s not <unk> to <unk> that &apos;s not a lot of <unk> that &apos;s a little bit of a lot of <unk> .
There &apos;s a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . I don &apos;t know .
But I &apos;m not enough to <unk> a <unk> <unk> to the <unk> that the <unk> of our <unk> .
Now , the <unk> of <unk> -- I &apos;ve got to <unk> -- -- the <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> .
What you can see this is the <unk> is the <unk> <unk> .
There are many of the world , and you &apos;re <unk> , in the problem , in the problem is that we don &apos;t have to <unk> .
The problem is that they &apos;re going to <unk> .
So the <unk> of the <unk> is a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that &apos;s <unk> and <unk> is <unk> : this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
I want to be these <unk> , and <unk> , and it &apos;s not <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
We can do it .
If you &apos;re going to be what we &apos;re going to be able to <unk> , where they were the people have a <unk> , but it &apos;s not <unk> , but it &apos;s not to the <unk> , but we have to the <unk> .
This is what the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
One of the <unk> of the <unk> -- it &apos;s not to the <unk> -- the <unk> of this <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : &quot; <unk> , you can see what you can do you see what you can do you . &quot;
<unk> people , people <unk> , &quot; <unk> : What do ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s <unk> that you can &apos;t <unk> a <unk> . &quot;
&quot; <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> of the world --
and I &apos;ve got the <unk> , and I &apos;ve got to the <unk> .
But then , <unk> , I &apos;m going to me , I &apos;m going to be the <unk> .
Because the <unk> of the <unk> is that if you &apos;re <unk> in the <unk> , in the way that &apos;s not what we &apos;re not <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> in the way that we can be the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> , and the <unk> .
<unk> .
This is a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> for us .
But the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
