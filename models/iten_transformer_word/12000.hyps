<unk> year I showed these <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years , has had the size of the United States , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> percent .
<unk> this <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a way , the global <unk> system .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You see , you know , you <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That &apos;s the ice in <unk> , which <unk> <unk> .
You can see that the ice <unk> ice , five or more , is , as a blood blood , which is <unk> from the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been like this .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> around the ocean <unk> , where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> are <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , that amount of global <unk> , that amount of <unk> , that amount of <unk> , that <unk> <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> in <unk> the <unk> is already <unk> by water .
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> last <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : She &apos;s good . The question is , if we <unk> it .
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the north .
This is a river in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> had never <unk> like that .
This is the <unk> river , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how the <unk> level of the sea level to <unk> <unk> , here is where you get the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the other part of the planet : <unk> , the largest ice <unk> of the planet .
<unk> month , scientists have <unk> that the ice is in <unk> , and that the <unk> <unk> , which <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> feet of the level of the <unk> , as in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the largest <unk> <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which few years ago , which few years ago were <unk> .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : this <unk> is the source of water <unk> of this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same thing happens to <unk> water .
In California , <unk> on the <unk> <unk> is <unk> percent .
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis .
<unk> , as you have bed , they &apos;re <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the world leads to a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and without <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years , than <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the whole <unk> .
If you look at the <unk> context , you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we &apos;ve <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the ocean every day .
Look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> , from <unk> , <unk> , and on both of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the ocean .
The biggest cause of global warming , together to <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions , together .
And you <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> .
But we &apos;re <unk> to a <unk> of direction .
These are the <unk> projects in the last few years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there &apos;s a political <unk> in our country .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
<unk> image : I <unk> something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it on the <unk> .
This is the largest flow flow flow flow in America .
It &apos;s success around <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> . â™« <unk> the <unk> is a <unk> and happy .
It &apos;s <unk> here in America , and it &apos;s <unk> our economy .
<unk> the <unk> is <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> here is a lot of <unk> <unk> .
The largest society <unk> society <unk> on the <unk> is <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- they don &apos;t know what they are talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , a part of it .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> , we see the climate change as a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , for our <unk> is <unk> a lot of money in a <unk> <unk> for public and <unk> the truth .
Actually , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it &apos;s <unk> -- it &apos;s got a good <unk> .
So , we don &apos;t <unk> climate change .
We could do it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you &apos;ve heard about it very much .
So , we <unk> a <unk> structure in a <unk> , as it is about <unk> .
<unk> ! The machines are a little <unk> , but this is the sound of <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> is between the global <unk> of global <unk> , but the <unk> technology of <unk> that you see all change .
And then , look at this is the <unk> <unk> technology .
<unk> : <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security .
<unk> : <unk> : America &apos;s America &apos;s in the crisis ; the <unk> , national security , <unk> crisis .
The <unk> that all of the <unk> : our <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and oil <unk> .
Now , but there &apos;s a new solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan to <unk> America at work , <unk> more <unk> , and help <unk> the global <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we <unk> to solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
<unk> : This is the last .
<unk> : It &apos;s about <unk> energy in America .
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> , at the <unk> that we <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> new <unk> network .
<unk> <unk> two : <unk> <unk> for jobs .
<unk> : <unk> America . It &apos;s time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A <unk> <unk> <unk> says , &quot; If you want to go , go alone .
If you want to go away , you go back and go together . &quot;
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED , I made a <unk> on the <unk> .
And <unk> <unk> to <unk> on how the car works .
So , <unk> here . And for the ones that the other time , there were no <unk> , the largest <unk> experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were less than a <unk> <unk> of the universe -- until <unk> millions of times a second .
That &apos;s just <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk> .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> <unk> feet and has a <unk> of <unk> meters .
This is a <unk> picture of <unk> in building so you can see the <unk> .
The 10 <unk> last year we <unk> the car for the first time .
And this was <unk> by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> of particles that had done all the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles in the <unk> .
In other words , when you <unk> that image the 10 <unk> , I <unk> that the car <unk> , which is a great <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if that was that <unk> us more or this , when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the <unk> page was this .
That means we had a <unk> impact on the scientific <unk> .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the car , had to these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works when the car works at the <unk> <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you <unk> and <unk> , &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot; It &apos;s too <unk> . &quot;
And they can do that because when they &apos;re very <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , <unk> degrees <unk> , at least <unk> degrees <unk> to that of the space of the stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> between the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think these <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s <unk> of about 30 <unk> .
It &apos;s about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
Now , they &apos;re now <unk> all the place of their <unk> place .
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> will be again .
<unk> , and we <unk> to get data to <unk> or <unk> , and continue to <unk> that our <unk> to find out what the universe are the <unk> that we <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these <unk> <unk> the value of science and engineering engineering engineering engineering engineering . It &apos;s easy to <unk> .
I think that &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s so hard , I think that &apos;s the value of things like <unk> .
I want to <unk> with the words of a <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> , which , <unk> , in <unk> of <unk> experiments in <unk> , his <unk> was Michael <unk> , said , &quot; No is <unk> to the progress of human mind how <unk> that ideas of science of how <unk> science <unk> how <unk> that are <unk> , and that our <unk> are <unk> , and that our <unk> are not <unk> in nature , and that our <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to <unk> <unk> to <unk> when , from children , <unk> with <unk> .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , actually , to think and <unk> problems .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that we <unk> most of the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects , and my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I started <unk> , and I started <unk> , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having the <unk> of <unk> as a digital <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a information with both hands ,
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was , the question was , building the <unk> , building the <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a big <unk> , like a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a big <unk> , like a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , they can &quot; <unk> &quot; between them , and they have a screen and a <unk> and a <unk> <unk> .
But <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> it .
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> the digital information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of their movement , <unk> , other , and <unk> , and as they become <unk> , <unk> of their movement , of the other , of how we can explore new <unk> and <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you video , if you <unk> it in a direction , the <unk> video , the <unk> <unk> , so if you <unk> on the other side .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of the other people .
If you <unk> them , they <unk> what they are around them .
If they <unk> it , they <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
If they <unk> it , they <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We then realized that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was that we can use <unk> <unk> on data , like &quot; <unk> &quot; a color &quot; <unk> &quot; a color <unk> like if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as <unk> and I can <unk> it to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> , where you <unk> .
and I can <unk> to <unk> color in the <unk> , where you <unk> .
If you <unk> too , we can <unk> a little bit .
There are also <unk> possibilities of <unk> , like <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , where people can try things . And they <unk> the results immediately .
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a <unk> sequence that I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a game here of words that &apos;s <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> , a letter to <unk> on every <unk> , <unk> , to every <unk> a letter to case , and <unk> a letter to <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you <unk> , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities of <unk> .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s kids <unk> in <unk> <unk> , I made it <unk> , I made it <unk> and I <unk> a video .
They &apos;re very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things that kind of <unk> is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of <unk> .
You just say , &quot; <unk> of words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , there on the right .
It was actually just <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> building a tool for the <unk> of <unk> . He &apos;s <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So , it &apos;s <unk> out .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now , he brought a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : Yeah ! Yeah !
So , <unk> <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters ,
<unk> : <unk> !
-- <unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It &apos;s a <unk> story with the final <unk> , and it can decide how to <unk> him .
<unk> : It &apos;s a <unk> story with the final <unk> , and it can decide how to <unk> him .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time to show you is a <unk> , that &apos;s <unk> , to <unk> and <unk> music .
It &apos;s a <unk> , that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , to <unk> and <unk> music .
The <unk> here are <unk> by <unk> as basic , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of these has four different <unk> , and you can choose what they use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of <unk> to your <unk> .
And we just <unk> by making a sound , &quot; and a sequence . &quot; sequence &quot;
These are actually <unk> live , like <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> it up with a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are the <unk> effects as time and <unk> , that <unk> the whole sequence .
<unk> how it works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> , <unk> a <unk> <unk> , <unk> in a series , &quot; sequence <unk> , <unk> in a series , <unk> , <unk> , other basic <unk> .
Now , we <unk> a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> : Now , <unk> <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> : And now , I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> , so I can control the <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the entire sequence time <unk> the whole sequence time from one side .
<unk> : <unk> : And now , <unk> the <unk> to give more <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the sequence of the flight .
So , I don &apos;t have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
And now , finally , I can <unk> the whole sequence on the left the <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new <unk> <unk> and more <unk> to how our brain works and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of this path , and some of this <unk> that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to <unk> is that it &apos;s <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects , which <unk> information in our world in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time of talking to all of you .
I &apos;m a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love love and my <unk> .
And it doesn &apos;t look like that .
But , I said this , something particular happened was <unk> in my life and in my career , which has brought me to <unk> the whole relationship with this job .
The particular thing is I <unk> wrote this book , this <unk> called &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which , <unk> &quot; which , &quot; <unk> , &quot; which , &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And the result is that it &apos;s everywhere , people like me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
<unk> from me to me all <unk> and say , &quot; You don &apos;t have fear of <unk> ?
You don &apos;t fear to be <unk> for all life without able to create a book that can <unk> to someone else ? &quot;
How can you <unk> to someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> , you know .
But it could be worse , and I remember that over 20 years ago , when I was <unk> to say , I was a <unk> -- that I was a <unk> -- that I wanted to be a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> at the same <unk> <unk> .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t <unk> that we don &apos;t have success ?
Do you have no fear <unk> <unk> you ?
You don &apos;t fear that <unk> for all life without any life that nothing has ever outside and die on a <unk> of dreams with the <unk> <unk> &apos;s <unk> &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yeah , I fear of all those things .
I always <unk> .
And I &apos;m also afraid of many other things that people can &apos;t <unk> .
As <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as it is , I think , and I was <unk> <unk> , is it ?
Is it <unk> ?
It &apos;s <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you can do .
But what is there is so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> do ?
How did my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I don &apos;t remember one time in his 40 years of activity that he was asked if she had fear to be <unk> ?
It never -- that <unk> of the <unk> John , as <unk> ?
Do you know that , <unk> ?
<unk> , the engineers as well as a group of not have , in <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
We have enough , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> but <unk> of all kinds , we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk> .
And we don &apos;t know what you look at the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often for them .
And the ones that don &apos;t look at the <unk> of them .
<unk> <unk> , before die , in the last <unk> said , &quot; Every my book has <unk> a little bit more <unk> than a <unk> <unk> about your work .
But <unk> <unk> when you <unk> it , you know , because we &apos;ve heard these things so long , we have completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and creativity is <unk> in some way , and that <unk> , at the end , <unk> always <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> all here today is : are you <unk> with this idea ?
It &apos;s good you . Because it &apos;s because it &apos;s <unk> by a <unk> distance to me not .
I think it &apos;s <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s also <unk> and I don &apos;t want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better <unk> our great <unk> to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- in my <unk> -- it would be very <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> where I &apos;m in my career .
<unk> -- look at it , I &apos;m pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I &apos;ve got about four <unk> of work .
And it &apos;s very <unk> that anything that &apos;s going to happen in the world as the work that <unk> after <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , after the success of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we &apos;re all <unk> friends here -- is <unk> that my biggest <unk> is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> thought !
You know , that &apos;s the kind of thought that leads a person to start <unk> <unk> at nine <unk> <unk> . And I don &apos;t want to do it .
I &apos;m going to continue doing this job .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so , it seems to me , after many <unk> , that the way to work to keep writing is that to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to have a <unk> distance of <unk> between me , which I &apos;m <unk> , and my natural <unk> on what <unk> <unk> <unk> do . And as I was <unk> for all last year , how to look at the other society to see if we had to look through time , trying to find other society to see if we had to have a <unk> of the best ideas and <unk> .
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research led me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> because they <unk> and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don &apos;t believe that creativity is <unk> by men , OK ?
It turns out that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and that <unk> to men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for reasons <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> from far away .
The <unk> were the same idea , but <unk> that species of spirit without a <unk> .
which is <unk> , because the <unk> didn &apos;t really understand that a <unk> was <unk> .
And I thought a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally <unk> in the <unk> of a artist , a little artist , a little bit like the <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> out of <unk> the <unk> of the artist and <unk> the work of that work .
<unk> <unk> here , that &apos;s the distance of which I talk -- that <unk> <unk> you from your work .
And everybody <unk> that was so <unk> , right ?
So , artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like , for example , too <unk> , right ?
If your work was <unk> <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , if your work was <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it wasn &apos;t all your <unk> , right ?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> creativity is in <unk> for a long time .
And then the <unk> <unk> and everything , and we <unk> this great idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe , and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and no longer to leave space on the <unk> .
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people who are thinking that creativity is completely <unk> by <unk> .
And for the first time in history , <unk> , <unk> to <unk> this , or that artist as a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think that was a big <unk> .
I think that &apos;s going to be a simple person , and to believe that I think of being a <unk> like the source , the <unk> and the <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> <unk> too much as much as a <unk> to <unk> human <unk> .
It &apos;s like to ask someone to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s been this pressure to have <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years .
And , if that &apos;s true , and I think that &apos;s , the question becomes , and I &apos;m now ?
Can we do it ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe it doesn &apos;t .
Maybe we can &apos;t <unk> 500 years of thinking about <unk> <unk> in a <unk> talk of 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you <unk> that people <unk> <unk> to <unk> their projects .
<unk> you probably don &apos;t <unk> all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to <unk> is -- why ?
Why not we <unk> this way ?
Because it has more sense of everything else that has ever heard to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process .
A process that , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- it knows , everybody here -- you know , you don &apos;t <unk> <unk> .
And , in fact , it can be completely <unk> .
I made this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , who has now 90 years , but who has been a <unk> for all life and said that during her <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> in the <unk> , and <unk> it in the <unk> , and I <unk> it in the <unk> .
He said , she was like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> <unk> to her <unk> .
<unk> it , because he was <unk> the land under his feet .
<unk> to have one thing to do that point and was , words , &quot; <unk> as a <unk> . &quot;
And so <unk> , he was <unk> by this <unk> , and it wouldn &apos;t have to take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> , and a <unk> <unk> <unk> and a <unk> <unk> on the page .
<unk> times , not <unk> to be enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> her <unk> and she would <unk> her through and she would <unk> through the <unk> , and she would <unk> through the <unk> , looking at her , &quot; she said , &quot; another <unk> . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this piece of <unk> , and there were no moments when the moments was almost <unk> , OK ?
So , she was <unk> at home and he was trying to <unk> the <unk> and <unk> through , and <unk> a <unk> <unk> in the while she was <unk> , and then he said , that it was like , if you <unk> with the other hand and the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> and the <unk> in his body and <unk> in his body and <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the page <unk> and <unk> , but the <unk> , the last one .
So when I <unk> it -- it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not all my <unk> process -- I &apos;m not a <unk> !
I &apos;m a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; I &apos;m <unk> at the same <unk> every day and <unk> and work and <unk> over .
But even me , in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I &apos;m <unk> that a lot of you have to do that .
You know , even though , and ideas , ideas , I <unk> <unk> from a certain source , I could not <unk> <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it to it in a way we don &apos;t have to <unk> your head , but rather , what do we <unk> <unk> ?
And for me , the best example , I &apos;m the best example , I &apos;ve <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;ve <unk> years ago for a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> artist &apos;s <unk> , trying to control , <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , he <unk> , and one day , and one day , and a <unk> <unk> , <unk> everything for him .
<unk> <unk> , and all of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> , which is in its head as <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , and she wants , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the <unk> , but it doesn &apos;t know how to <unk> .
It has no <unk> piece , it doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , it has no <unk> .
So , it starts to hear this kind of old <unk> <unk> in him , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to <unk> from this <unk> song .
It &apos;s not enough <unk> and I can &apos;t <unk> . &quot;
And instead of <unk> , they <unk> , they <unk> .
<unk> the whole process and made something completely new .
<unk> simply the sky and said , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , you see that I &apos;m <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Do you think that &apos;s a song of a song ?
If you really want to <unk> , you know , you know , you know , <unk> when I can <unk> care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> <unk> other today .
<unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And his process <unk> <unk> after that .
Not the work , it was still <unk> as always as well .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when I was <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> out of him <unk> , the <unk> that he <unk> away from where he was , <unk> that he didn &apos;t have to be a <unk> thing and <unk> .
but <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this thing <unk> and <unk> that , but it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
So , how much that story <unk> to change a little bit more , and the way I <unk> and already <unk> once .
This idea , when I was <unk> &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; and I was <unk> , and I was in one of those <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re working on something and we &apos;re not going to be a <unk> , which is going to be the <unk> book .
Not only <unk> , right now , just the <unk> book .
And we started thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I &apos;m <unk> to <unk> that <unk> up and <unk> us .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and I <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> corner of the room .
And I said , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , what , both of them , and we know that if this book is not going to be <unk> , right ?
Because you see me , I &apos;m <unk> all I have , I don &apos;t have more of that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to <unk> and your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , don &apos;t <unk> me .
I started writing the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to be <unk> that I &apos;m <unk> to do my own part . &quot; Because -- I &apos;m <unk> to the end of Africa &apos;s Africa &apos;s <unk> , OK -- I &apos;m going to go to the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> music that <unk> for hours and hours to <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every <unk> , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> .
And I know what I talk about , because you have a <unk> , because you &apos;ve all of a point , a <unk> like that .
It was like time , you <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> through a species of <unk> and it wasn &apos;t doing anything different from the <unk> , as the <unk> <unk> <unk> before , but all <unk> .
And all of a sudden , not just as a human .
But it <unk> from <unk> and <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> fire .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , he <unk> the name .
<unk> hands and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , &quot; God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; which is still <unk> , that you can still feel in <unk> or <unk> .
In <unk> , when a artist has done something impossible and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
And it &apos;s <unk> because we need .
But , the problem comes the day after , for the <unk> itself , when you <unk> and <unk> that are the 11 of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> that God is no longer .
It &apos;s just a <unk> with a lot of <unk> , and maybe not <unk> <unk> to that <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God again , while I was <unk> , and what has to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> <unk> in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so <unk> if you can &apos;t believe , <unk> , <unk> the most <unk> of your being being being from you .
But let &apos;s just <unk> that you have data in <unk> from a <unk> of this <unk> part of your life that you have to <unk> when you &apos;re finished .
And , you know , if you think of that way , you think of it changes .
And so I started <unk> , and it &apos;s certainly like I <unk> it for several months in the book that was soon <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , not fear .
Don &apos;t <unk> . You just <unk> your work .
<unk> <unk> for your <unk> , whatever it can be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If you <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> <unk> to you <unk> <unk> some <unk> <unk> , some kind of <unk> , for a only moment through your <unk> , then &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
<unk> , you do that , you do the same <unk> .
And I said , &quot; <unk> ! &quot; <unk> .
I think , and I think , you know , <unk> <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; <unk> &quot; to you , &quot; even for <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot;
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
You know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can <unk> and about new genes of genes .
Now we &apos;re <unk> a new path : we started <unk> the biology and now starting from that digital code we &apos;re <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We always have been trying to <unk> <unk> questions .
&quot; <unk> is life ? &quot; is something that many <unk> , I think have to <unk> <unk> . I think they have to <unk> <unk> .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> by 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome is <unk> to go from the world &apos;s <unk> of the digital world of computers .
Now , <unk> : Can we <unk> life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species of the most small genome between those that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> a little more small .
We can be able to <unk> a <unk> of genes about 500 that are here .
But when we look at the <unk> map , it &apos;s <unk> than our own .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at a time , it &apos;s very <unk> that this can bring a <unk> cell .
So , we thought the only way to <unk> this <unk> was <unk> this <unk> <unk> to <unk> some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of &quot; Can we <unk> a <unk> ? &quot;
Can the chemistry <unk> of making these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And , in <unk> <unk> , can we make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> material <unk> .
And the speed that we &apos;re able to <unk> the life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the code , <unk> , instead , <unk> rather slowly , but it &apos;s <unk> .
And our most <unk> results in a <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before .
But we found that <unk> of DNA is very hard .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA , <unk> <unk> <unk> and it &apos;s a <unk> process : the more <unk> is <unk> , more <unk> there are .
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , <unk> information from digital information <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
It &apos;s a small virus that <unk> bacteria .
We designed the <unk> , we <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA <unk> .
And the interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> it in bacteria , bacteria have <unk> to read this <unk> code and <unk> the <unk> particles .
<unk> particles have been <unk> by cells , and they have <unk> and <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I talked about recently members of the <unk> industry that they have certainly <unk> this model .
They have more <unk> than you .
And I thought this is a situation where the software can really build its own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we had to do things in big .
<unk> to build the whole <unk> of <unk> .
They &apos;re more than <unk> <unk> <unk> code .
So we thought we &apos;d <unk> in <unk> of the size virus , so we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> are the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if we <unk> information with <unk> information in a computer , these have to be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time , the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> .
We found out , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If we used that sequence was <unk> , we never could do it .
One part of the process is design <unk> <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build more small <unk> that <unk> together .
<unk> elements here .
You probably have read that <unk> us in the <unk> .
<unk> : We have a <unk> code on four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , and there &apos;s about 20 <unk> , and there &apos;s a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk> .
So we can use the <unk> code for write words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did at the beginning was <unk> .
Some of them have been <unk> by the fact that it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to them to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , we made these <unk> in <unk> so we can <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re <unk> to create a extremely <unk> <unk> as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to <unk> the process .
So , that seems like a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When we started these <unk> <unk> , much more than 100 <unk> <unk> , they don &apos;t <unk> directly into the <unk> <unk> .
It comes to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> biology .
So we have <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology , <unk> to <unk> the DNA that we can <unk> the <unk> .
Here &apos;s a example .
This <unk> called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> is <unk> .
In 12 hours , 24 hours , it &apos;s <unk> exactly as it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can completely <unk> .
You have to live under <unk> .
I &apos;m sure that life <unk> in space , and you <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
In fact , NASA has shown that this is happening .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we &apos;ve built these <unk> , just using the <unk> design <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is not been <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a big <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> that we &apos;ve done a little bit of time ago .
They &apos;re more than <unk> <unk> code .
It &apos;s the largest <unk> of a <unk> structure ever <unk> by man .
It has a <unk> <unk> <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a 10 without spaces , we <unk> <unk> pages to <unk> this <unk> code .
Now , how do we do it ?
Of course , through a virus is a kids .
It &apos;s a little bit more <unk> when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s easier when it &apos;s <unk> cells like our : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the process of <unk> .
In <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> in the cell , but we have <unk> <unk> that we can do a <unk> <unk> <unk> from a cell <unk> from a cell <unk> to another and <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> species .
The two are different as men from <unk> .
We &apos;ve <unk> some <unk> <unk> in a way that we can decide what to choose to do for this <unk> .
<unk> <unk> all the <unk> in a way to <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> <unk> up the new <unk> <unk> in the cell .
And <unk> <unk> that we didn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to <unk> , but we tried to <unk> more in there .
This is one of the biggest <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere , and <unk> in a second of new <unk> to that species .
So , who think of evolution as a <unk> <unk> at a time , that &apos;s not very much of biology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell didn &apos;t <unk> one .
<unk> <unk> we <unk> it .
It &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> , <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> , and we <unk> with only the cell .
It &apos;s become blue because of the genes that we <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species , you go to the whole new species , <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell new software that we <unk> in the cell .
All of the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code that &apos;s <unk> , and when you <unk> the code exactly what we &apos;ve <unk> .
Now , this might be <unk> <unk> , but <unk> the software software of <unk> , we can change things in a pretty <unk> .
Now , I &apos;ve already <unk> that here is not about <unk> -- but <unk> progress from three million years and a half million years of evolution , and I &apos;ve already said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> in which we <unk> new new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> when we think of our <unk> .
We &apos;re going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give one example : I was born in <unk> .
Now , there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> ; 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re <unk> problems now , to find food , water and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> for six billion people .
<unk> more <unk> to do it for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> <unk> .
That means 100 million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process of <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
In more , we need to realize that all the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that we <unk> in the atmosphere .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> in all the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry only <unk> <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from reality and our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , thank you very much of <unk> , we can create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think about <unk> these 20 million genes or <unk> , or <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> , to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology than the last 20 years .
And it &apos;s just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> <unk> , chemistry or chemistry , chemistry , chemistry , <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software that we &apos;re working on for being able to <unk> and design and design species at the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how to be .
We know exactly what their <unk> code .
Now we &apos;re <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> generation .
You saw <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment was a <unk> experiment .
We <unk> <unk> and third generation that we <unk> enough soon <unk> from <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way biology can have a great impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> in matter , and we &apos;re working on for cells , and we think we can achieve that first of <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> solar <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> in the ocean , at about <unk> meters of the temperature of water .
<unk> <unk> from CO2 using <unk> as energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2 , which can easily be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , we think short , we might be able to <unk> what life is the basic question . &quot; What &apos;s life is &quot; We , we <unk> the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole <unk> industry .
<unk> . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you ?
<unk> a main source of energy .
<unk> , we &apos;re working for using the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk> .
You saw this year with flu , we always <unk> a year and a dollar in less when it &apos;s <unk> .
I think that &apos;s going to change building <unk> in <unk> .
So here &apos;s how the future might start looking at <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and finally <unk> cells .
We &apos;re so much <unk> to <unk> people .
Our purpose is to do a lot of <unk> to live long <unk> to try and <unk> . Thank you very much .
First of all , I &apos;m going to show you , the most quickly , some fundamental <unk> , of the new technology that we took to <unk> <unk> <unk> almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
It &apos;s a environment where you can <unk> is at the local level that <unk> with a huge amount of data <unk> .
Here we &apos;re seeing <unk> <unk> pictures of <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a fast <unk> , <unk> images like we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much information is that we see , how big <unk> of data or <unk> .
Most of them are <unk> pictures , but this is a <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that <unk> <unk> <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in any moment . It &apos;s also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , which is not <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
And so , you know , it &apos;s not <unk> , we can do something like that , to see that it &apos;s really a real <unk> <unk> , not a picture .
It may be a little <unk> to read a <unk> book .
You don &apos;t know that .
This is a <unk> example . It &apos;s a <unk> number of The <unk> .
Every image of a big <unk> .
And you really gives you the <unk> and the beautiful experience of reading the <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature of a <unk> .
We also made something with the corner of this particular number of The <unk> <unk> .
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much <unk> than that you can use in a normal <unk> and we <unk> .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
And I thought this <unk> will be <unk> and other <unk> like <unk> , not <unk> <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on that not , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not for a <unk> <unk> , we have <unk> in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> over a <unk> picture of NASA .
So now I &apos;m going to go to something else .
This is actually alive on the web ; you can see it .
It &apos;s a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a very interesting <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> student of Washington , with the <unk> of Washington , with the help of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> . A <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s alive , <unk> <unk> .
You can see when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of experience <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of images here has actually a meaning .
<unk> <unk> of the computer <unk> have <unk> these images together , so that we <unk> to the <unk> places where the <unk> are <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> . So you see some of the elements of a <unk> <unk> or <unk> , and these things have been <unk> . And these things have been <unk> all <unk> to <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to <unk> directly to one of the <unk> of the <unk> data and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> that we &apos;ve done for the first time , for the last summer <unk> to show you what &apos;s really the key to show you what you really think about the key <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the web .
We had to <unk> <unk> and <unk> and so forth .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> . And so on . <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> an image that you have to this model .
So they &apos;re all <unk> <unk> and have been all <unk> at the level of <unk> in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to <unk> this <unk> way .
You know , I would never thought of work to work for <unk> .
It &apos;s very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of <unk> : from those <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> number , a <unk> number , <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I <unk> up those <unk> .
A lot of are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
<unk> here is a series of pictures -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from the <unk> to the physics of this environment .
The <unk> point is that we can do things with the social environment . This is now <unk> data from the whole memory of how we <unk> the land , from the <unk> point of view and <unk> all of the data .
All of those pictures become <unk> together , the <unk> of the <unk> of the parts .
You have a model of the land that &apos;s <unk> .
Think about this as the <unk> of <unk> <unk> on Earth <unk> Earth .
It &apos;s something that we <unk> in <unk> hand , and the people who are <unk> , and the <unk> that we <unk> for the <unk> .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people .
If somebody &apos;s a idea of <unk> all of these <unk> <unk> , my <unk> <unk> <unk> , my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of all of those data , and I can use it as a <unk> to <unk> in that space , in that <unk> , using the <unk> of anybody else , and have a social experience of social <unk> and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all that are very <unk> <unk> of every part of the land , <unk> not only <unk> and <unk> and <unk> . But from <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> thank you .
Chris Anderson : Do I understand ? What &apos;s your software ? What &apos;s your software is that at a certain point , in the next few years , all the pictures <unk> from anybody in the whole world , all the pictures <unk> will be almost <unk> ?
<unk> : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> , if you want , in the images .
And it &apos;s doing it at the content of the images .
And it becomes very interesting if you think of the information <unk> that a lot of these images .
As you get a research <unk> , on the web , you <unk> a <unk> and the text page and the web has a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture <unk> all your pictures ?
So , the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really huge . It &apos;s a <unk> effect .
CA : <unk> , it &apos;s really incredible . <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is the <unk> that you don &apos;t have the <unk> <unk> , between who <unk> the past in the wind , the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> in the <unk> of plants .
<unk> to think that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> , or that the <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , or that in <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of the world that we live in there is no sense , but it &apos;s just a model , but it &apos;s just a model , but it &apos;s just a model ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , good or bad , a lot of <unk> .
And , of course , all of the <unk> <unk> .
All <unk> . All right . All right .
We &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
We need to deal with the <unk> of death , so we don &apos;t <unk> if we <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art .
What <unk> is the particular <unk> of song , the <unk> of the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of <unk> .
He was my <unk> <unk> in <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> , the mother <unk> .
All of these <unk> , we have other ways of thinking , other ways of <unk> , other ways of moving around the world .
And , if you <unk> a second , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of <unk> in the world create a <unk> of life and <unk> that <unk> the planet and <unk> that <unk> the planet as a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , ideas , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being from being human imagination .
<unk> is the fantastic <unk> of humanity .
It &apos;s the <unk> of what we can be and what we can be as <unk> species .
And <unk> the <unk> has been <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> much <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or the <unk> of <unk> , because it &apos;s <unk> , or -- in the <unk> <unk> -- and you &apos;re <unk> -- and you don &apos;t even even <unk> <unk> -- that <unk> of the diversity of <unk> .
The <unk> of that is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just a language <unk> or a series of <unk> rules .
One language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle with the <unk> of every culture is coming in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we &apos;re sitting here at least , at least half not <unk> in the <unk> of kids .
They don &apos;t get <unk> to kids , which means less than <unk> something , which is not <unk> something , which are already .
What &apos;s more <unk> than the <unk> of being <unk> by <unk> , of being the last to talk about a language , not <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , or to <unk> the <unk> of children ?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of someone in some part of the world every two weeks : every two weeks a <unk> and <unk> with itself in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I know that anybody who &apos;s <unk> . &quot; It &apos;s not better ?
The world would not be a better place if we <unk> all the same language ? &quot; <unk> , then we talk all the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> of a <unk> thing is , you can &apos;t talk about your language .
Today , I &apos;d like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
a small journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we &apos;re <unk> .
Many of us , I think , &quot; different ways of <unk> &quot; I really want to <unk> different ways of <unk> .
So , for example , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , which <unk> to <unk> <unk> from the river of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s not able to <unk> the blue color of the blue , because the time <unk> is <unk> in the time of the forest , which <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> &quot; : you have to <unk> a different language .
This is <unk> in the past <unk> , but the <unk> is that in these <unk> families , where you &apos;re talking about six or seven <unk> to cause of the <unk> <unk> nobody <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> to hear and then <unk> to talk .
I had one of the most interesting <unk> with which I lived , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> , five <unk> have <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
They made <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> that <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> forest <unk> had never seen anything <unk> .
They <unk> the <unk> pictures from the land , they <unk> the research of a form or a <unk> and , they didn &apos;t know anything , they have <unk> that they <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
But <unk> not only <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> between them .
<unk> percent <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We went down eight <unk> and we found two cases of natural <unk> and we found two cases of them , they <unk> that one of them was so that he &apos;s dead , and then they <unk> the same .
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species .
<unk> years old , I was <unk> a really interesting task when my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I was <unk> if I wanted to go to <unk> between the <unk> society and <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And to give a sense of <unk> , I should understand the <unk> culture and that <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s pretty much a <unk> <unk> view of the world .
Very interesting .
If you <unk> the great <unk> of <unk> in the world , what do you <unk> ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that Africa <unk> did not have <unk> <unk> . And instead , and the <unk> is not the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> very <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
What makes interesting is that <unk> is the <unk> of life and death .
So <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> and live in a <unk> live in a short moment , the <unk> becomes the <unk> .
For that <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , you go to <unk> to <unk> <unk> to talk about God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . &quot;
And since you &apos;re <unk> , is the spirit that <unk> you , how do you get <unk> ?
So , you start to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> in state of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> of power in the body when it was <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> that I &apos;ve lived with the most <unk> are the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> civilization that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> has never been <unk> by the <unk> .
<unk> today are <unk> by a <unk> , but their <unk> <unk> is extraordinary .
The young <unk> are <unk> by three or four years , and they live in a world made of <unk> and <unk> in a world made of <unk> and <unk> in <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> of nine months <unk> from the <unk> of the nine months of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of the mother , now are <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
For all this time , they &apos;re <unk> to values about their society , values that <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> and just their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
And Al term at this incredible <unk> , they get <unk> out and for the first time in life , at age of 18 , they see a <unk> <unk> . And in that moment of <unk> <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk> , everything that they learned in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , everything that they learned in the <unk> . The <unk> does a step back and says ,
&quot; <unk> ? <unk> as I said . &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> . Now it &apos;s <unk> . Now , it &apos;s <unk> .
They call the <unk> <unk> and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think of the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the old <unk> history of <unk> , which is a <unk> concept in its <unk> or maybe <unk> and say that these <unk> are <unk> to the Earth &apos;s <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by the <unk> .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> , but because of time and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , have created a <unk> of the Earth &apos;s <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> that the Earth can only live because it &apos;s <unk> by the human <unk> .
What does that mean ?
<unk> to say that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> that <unk> its <unk> will be a different <unk> and has a different relationship and has a different relationship , or that place , and that place to be <unk> .
That &apos;s a <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
And that <unk> me a human being different from my friends , who believe that <unk> are <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> that live in the north of the world , <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> .
If we <unk> that these <unk> can create different reality , we start to understand some of their <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> this <unk> .
I <unk> this picture of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
Some of you have heard about the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What makes fascinating is not the potential <unk> is , but its <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> by two elements .
On one hand , this <unk> <unk> <unk> that has a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> , and you have a <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> with the <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> &apos;s family &apos;s <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> .
If you &apos;re going to see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> that are <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . <unk> &apos;t makes a <unk> <unk> . It makes a <unk> of the reality .
<unk> often with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of <unk> in the &apos; <unk> .
<unk> , my <unk> can &apos;t <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you &apos;re not doing that , you can &apos;t tell anybody to be <unk> .
It &apos;s possible to <unk> <unk> if we <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now , it &apos;s the <unk> that you find in this <unk> are <unk> of <unk> , the same kind of <unk> to <unk> the <unk> . The question is , in a <unk> of <unk> species , how do these <unk> <unk> , they make two <unk> , that if they <unk> in this way , they create a <unk> that &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> that is <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> ?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you <unk> to the <unk> , we &apos;ll <unk> us . &quot; The plants are talking about . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , who <unk> in the forest , and that our eyes will be in the same species .
If you <unk> how to <unk> their <unk> <unk> , we <unk> <unk> , you know , you don &apos;t know everything ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take the <unk> <unk> in a night of the moon and <unk> with a different <unk> .
With this doesn &apos;t <unk> us to <unk> , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> .
Now , &#91; the problem &#93; is that the ones that have to us who have to heart <unk> them , but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of history of our real world , and it <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , between 300 years , not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk> , but rather like the <unk> was where we <unk> and we <unk> and <unk> and we have <unk> <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of mass diversity and <unk> . Now the problem is not the problem . Now the problem is not the change .
All of <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities of life .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> and <unk> and <unk> as they have <unk> and <unk> as they have <unk> to be <unk> when they have <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It &apos;s the power .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And if you look at a look at the world , you know , they &apos;re not <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> and <unk> out of the existence of <unk> <unk> that go beyond their <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that has <unk> <unk> in the forest to a generation , and now <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where you can see the river <unk> , where you can see the river <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> .
If we <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the <unk> <unk> of politics .
As <unk> <unk> , the <unk> physics of a <unk> , is <unk> at <unk> level , but the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of a <unk> , not only is <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it &apos;s <unk> in certain <unk> , because it &apos;s <unk> a lot of development .
And you can &apos;t understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you get out of the beginning .
I <unk> miles from <unk> in China through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> <unk> , I realized what &apos;s behind the <unk> that we &apos;re talking about .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
The father &apos;s father <unk> at the <unk> <unk> .
which means that it &apos;s been <unk> at the time of Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that has brought the <unk> in <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk> .
It was taken to <unk> in <unk> at age of two <unk> under his <unk> , because he wouldn &apos;t have a living without him .
The <unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
One day has <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to work for seven years .
<unk> <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of <unk> is <unk> .
At the end , it &apos;s all <unk> to a choice .
Do you have to live in the world of <unk> or we want to <unk> the world of diversity of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> , before she died said that his greatest fear was that , in our <unk> to this <unk> view of the world , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it &apos;s <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , who has given us the agriculture , which has made us to the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , creating the <unk> of the <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has to <unk> 300 years .
That <unk> story , not <unk> me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we <unk> to come .
When these <unk> <unk> of the world is , what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of being what we are : a <unk> species , which has to <unk> that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are great moments of <unk> moments . And there are great moments of <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the north of <unk> island , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , and this man , <unk> me , and he <unk> the <unk> story .
The government <unk> wasn &apos;t always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the &apos; <unk> for <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> for his life , <unk> all the <unk> , and all his <unk> .
You want to know that <unk> <unk> the cold , the <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> were made of <unk> fish in the <unk> skin .
The <unk> of this man didn &apos;t <unk> from the night , or the <unk> that <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> away , you have <unk> the <unk> in the skin of <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I <unk> them , they <unk> it by creating a <unk> .
He &apos;s <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk> , she <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> has created a <unk> , has <unk> another dog and <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : How do you talk about <unk> ? &#91; And this &#93; , in different ways , &#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; . &#93; &#91; And &#93; <unk> &#93; <unk> .
<unk> <unk> the government <unk> has <unk> to <unk> the <unk> control of a larger area of <unk> California . And <unk> <unk> together .
It &apos;s their new <unk> . It &apos;s called <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s all the <unk> resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> at least at least , who &apos;s been <unk> in these areas of the planet , <unk> that they don &apos;t have any <unk> at all .
For somebody &apos;s house .
<unk> <unk> of human imagination that we <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the time . And for all of these kids , as our children , they become part of the <unk> <unk> of hope .
And finally , we <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> that <unk> <unk> never to anything .
<unk> that <unk> --
&#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; , but we think that stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our website <unk> millions of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in the <unk> to bring our audience in places of <unk> <unk> , where we <unk> <unk> from how they &apos;ve seen and , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> for a <unk> world &apos;s <unk> . The world &apos;s <unk> of <unk> in a <unk> world , and we have to find a <unk> of life in a <unk> world and <unk>
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope <unk> , and you &apos;ve heard some <unk> , in case , you don &apos;t <unk> them .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
<unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all the society <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> : &quot; If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens . &quot; The way to do it is <unk> freedom . &quot;
The reason is , on one side , in the fact that the freedom is <unk> , is <unk> , useful for human beings .
<unk> is the fact that if we &apos;re <unk> , each of us can act for all that we <unk> our <unk> , without nobody who <unk> in our <unk> , without nobody who <unk> in our <unk> .
The way to <unk> freedom is <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> , the more of the <unk> , and more of the <unk> , the more of the <unk> , the <unk> is their <unk> .
This is , <unk> <unk> <unk> in society that nobody has <unk> <unk> in society that nobody has <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it &apos;s also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I <unk> a simple note on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> that nobody has already <unk> .
That &apos;s what the <unk> is .
And then you go to the <unk> store for a <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> <unk> .
We can do six million and a half of different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one store .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice .
<unk> <unk> : the world &apos;s world &apos;s <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the <unk> services , <unk> <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , they didn &apos;t <unk> it .
A <unk> of that , between the other , was that the phone didn &apos;t have .
These days they went .
We have a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , especially between <unk> .
That &apos;s cell phones .
My <unk> is that in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
If you don &apos;t have that you &apos;ve still seen in the store , you &apos;re very much certain that soon soon <unk> .
And what happens is that people <unk> in the <unk> and does this question . And that question is , you know , the answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t make anything .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : It &apos;s not going on in the United States that you <unk> from <unk> and the <unk> you have to do .
Instead , <unk> by <unk> , and the <unk> says , &quot; OK , we could make it , or <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; has these <unk> and these <unk> . &quot; <unk> &quot;
You <unk> : &quot; <unk> , what do you do ? &quot;
And the <unk> says , &quot; At the <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> and <unk> and <unk> these <unk> and these <unk> . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; <unk> if you were me , what would you say ? &quot;
And the <unk> , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not a <unk> the weight and the responsibility to make decisions from somebody who knows , <unk> the <unk> , to <unk> that , to <unk> that , to <unk> that <unk> , and so it doesn &apos;t know -- and it &apos;s not in the <unk> to make decisions the patient .
There &apos;s a huge <unk> of products , <unk> , <unk> to people like me and you , that if you think about it , you know , you can &apos;t <unk> .
But if we can &apos;t <unk> , why do we <unk> them ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> that we call the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> as it is our <unk> now is a <unk> of choice , as you see in this <unk> . &quot; We don &apos;t want to <unk> kids . We want to <unk> their <unk> sex at the right time . &quot; We need to have to <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times we have .
which means that every <unk> , at the <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person .
<unk> to the family and <unk> , a time the common perspective , <unk> almost for anybody , was that there was <unk> as possible , and you can <unk> it , and you can <unk> it .
The only one of the real choice was with who , not , and even what to do after that .
<unk> , all of that is really to play .
<unk> students at a lot of smart , and <unk> them 20 percent in less than a time .
And it &apos;s not because they &apos;re not <unk> , because they &apos;re not <unk> .
but why are I <unk> , I &apos;m <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> or not ? <unk> do that now ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> later ? â™« â™« I &apos;ve got to think about kids or a career ? &quot;
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even though , if this <unk> doesn &apos;t <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and <unk> to my <unk> .
And they really have to do that . I &apos;m important questions .
Now , the job : we &apos;re <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because technology <unk> us to work every minute , every day , from every day , <unk> that <unk> from the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> , and I &apos;m not going to tell anybody what the <unk> works .
I don &apos;t say that , because I want to use it .
What does that mean , this incredible freedom of choice we have to do ? It &apos;s that we need to decide , <unk> at all time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son , with the <unk> in a <unk> , the <unk> in a <unk> , the other , and the <unk> , <unk> .
And even though they &apos;re all <unk> , every minute that we see our son <unk> , we &apos;re also <unk> , &quot; Do I have to answer this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this <unk> ? &quot;
And even when the answer is &quot; no , that makes the <unk> experience of your son very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the things , and big things , and big things , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but not everything was a question of choice .
The world of <unk> today to this : The <unk> is , &quot; Is it a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? &quot;
The answer is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the <unk> .
<unk> this choice <unk> two effects of people .
The first , <unk> , is that it <unk> instead of <unk> .
With a lot of <unk> between , which choice is very hard to do that .
I &apos;ll give you a <unk> example : a <unk> study <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> has had access to the data of <unk> , the <unk> <unk> society , with about a million <unk> <unk> in different companies .
What she found out is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> in more , the <unk> <unk> <unk> two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s 10 percent in less than <unk> than when they &apos;re available , they &apos;re only five . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> between , which is <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s hard to decide , and the choice is <unk> .
And <unk> , and again , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , and <unk> never <unk> .
<unk> that means not just these <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don &apos;t have enough money , even though , it wants to say that the decision is so <unk> that we <unk> the <unk> <unk> of work .
<unk> &apos;t <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> until five <unk> per year from the <unk> of work , which would be <unk> .
So , the <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices .
And I think that &apos;s going to <unk> the world .
&quot; And finally , for the <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
You want to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for <unk> , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and you <unk> the wrong <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even though we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice , we &apos;re less <unk> by the result of how we <unk> with less <unk> between them .
And that for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of <unk> between , which is , if you <unk> one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that <unk> could make a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the decision , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the decision , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
even when it was a decision .
<unk> choices , there are more easy to <unk> than any <unk> that is <unk> of choice .
<unk> , there &apos;s what <unk> call <unk> .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well <unk> how the value <unk> that we give things <unk> from what they <unk> .
<unk> , you know , when there are many possible <unk> , it &apos;s easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and be less than the <unk> .
So here &apos;s a <unk> . I <unk> with all the people who are not New York .
But that &apos;s what &apos;s probably <unk> .
There &apos;s this <unk> to the <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not <unk> . But what he thinks he &apos;s thinking is , &quot; Well , <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; All of my <unk> are away . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> right in front of home . &quot;
And it <unk> two weeks from the idea that &apos;s <unk> -- every day -- the possibility of <unk> where they want .
The <unk> <unk> the <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And more are the <unk> that we have <unk> , more the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It &apos;s about living the moment , and maybe it &apos;s a <unk> .
But the most important point is that anything you <unk> , you &apos;re not doing the other .
The things that don &apos;t <unk> have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a couple of <unk> .
<unk> almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were just one kind of <unk> , <unk> them and <unk> , they were <unk> , only after <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of times , <unk> to go .
So , I started <unk> a couple of the new when the <unk> were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> said , &quot; Do you want to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
Do you want them with <unk> or with <unk> ? &quot; <unk> &quot; or &quot; <unk> &quot; ?
&quot; Do you want to <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> them , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
I was <unk> , and after a little bit , I was able to say , &quot; I want the one guy who had no idea what was , &quot; was &quot; <unk> &quot; was &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; and then <unk> , <unk> , with the best couple of <unk> that I had ever had .
It was the <unk> . With that choice , and I had <unk> the best .
But I &apos;ll <unk> worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for <unk> .
The reason I was , I was worse with all that choice , my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I was <unk> <unk> . I didn &apos;t <unk> when I was <unk> <unk> when I was just one like , but when we <unk> 100 , at least one of had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After <unk> , I <unk> that I was <unk> in <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in life of people don &apos;t do that <unk> the <unk> that these have respect to the <unk> of the <unk> .
And that <unk> less <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world , if you realize that .
Because if I <unk> it , not <unk> what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more <unk> to that .
&quot; It was better when you were worse , &quot; The reason that you were better when you were worse , it was even worse than <unk> .
<unk> , in the world we live -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are at the <unk> of <unk> .
You &apos;ve never <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; Yeah , you want it . &quot;
I mean -- small <unk> -- that &apos;s a little bit of a <unk> , and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn &apos;t have better , but I &apos;m not <unk> .
But <unk> isn &apos;t always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> , when you have a couple of <unk> <unk> when you &apos;re not <unk> , and you will say , &quot; Why ? &quot;
Who is <unk> ? &quot; ? &quot; The answer is <unk> .
The world is the <unk> . What can I do ?
When there are hundreds of <unk> , and you get a <unk> , and you <unk> a <unk> , and you &apos;ll find who &apos;s the <unk> , it &apos;s clear that the <unk> you are .
<unk> could make better .
With hundreds of <unk> <unk> , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people take decisions , even if you get decisions , even though the result is <unk> , they <unk> and they <unk> their own .
In the last years , the <unk> is <unk> in the world .
I think a <unk> -- not the only one , but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is just that people have <unk> experiences because the <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation , they think that <unk> is their own .
So the final result is that in general we &apos;re better , <unk> , but we &apos;re worse .
<unk> you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely <unk> . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than that , but it doesn &apos;t <unk> that much choice is a lot of choice .
There &apos;s a <unk> value , <unk> . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve <unk> from a piece of the level that the choices that the <unk> our life .
Now , from the point of view <unk> -- I &apos;ve been <unk> -- from the point of view , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What you can do this <unk> choice in <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There are a lot of places in the world , and you have <unk> , where the problem is not that have <unk> choice .
The problem is that they have too <unk> .
So , the <unk> that I &apos;m talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> is this is : <unk> <unk> <unk> has talked about yesterday about yesterday about how those <unk> and <unk> to <unk> them to be <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> of money .
I mean , these choices , <unk> and <unk> , is not that are just <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
They do worse .
If a little bit of what we do in our society , it <unk> , it was <unk> in those where people have too much <unk> , it &apos;s not only our life to <unk> but also our life .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income is good at all -- not just the poor -- not just the poor -- not just the poor -- not just the poor -- not just the poor -- not just because of the poor , of this choice in <unk> .
And to <unk> , &quot; <unk> , you can become everything you want . &quot;
<unk> , people of culture , <unk> , &quot; What &apos;s going to happen that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s <unk> that you can &apos;t do anything in a glass <unk> . &quot;
A <unk> imagination , a <unk> view of the world --
and <unk> me , I <unk> it , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I realized that fish the fish knows that fish knows a long time .
Because the reality of fact is that if you <unk> in <unk> , so that &quot; everything is possible . &quot; You can &apos;t <unk> the freedom . &quot;
If you <unk> the <unk> in a way that you can <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> .
Everybody needs a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
