<unk> year I showed these <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years , had the size of the United States , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> percent .
I <unk> this <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is , in a certain sense , the heart of climate system .
They <unk> <unk> and <unk> of the summer .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
As you see , you know , you know , it &apos;s all about the blue <unk> .
That &apos;s the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , of five years , or more , it &apos;s like the blood , that &apos;s where it &apos;s from the body .
In 25 years it was done by this way , so .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> around the ocean <unk> , where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> , are being <unk> in <unk> by <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> from global <unk> , that amount of <unk> , that amount of <unk> could be <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> in <unk> , the <unk> is already <unk> by water .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> of <unk> was <unk> with a team <unk> last <unk> last <unk> last <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> Al <unk> : She &apos;s fine . The question is , if you <unk> it , we also .
One is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the north .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> had never <unk> like that .
This is the <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> .
If you want to know how the <unk> is going up the sea level to <unk> on <unk> , here is where the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
On the other hand of the planet : <unk> , the largest ice <unk> of the planet .
<unk> month , scientists have <unk> that the ice <unk> is in <unk> , and that the Western <unk> , which is <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> at six feet of the level of <unk> , like <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the third largest <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which few years ago , they were <unk> .
<unk> percent of the world &apos;s population <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : this <unk> is the source of <unk> water of this city .
The <unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same thing happens to <unk> water .
In California , <unk> on <unk> <unk> is <unk> percent <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are in crisis .
<unk> , as you have read , you know , they &apos;re <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the world takes to a <unk> increase in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and not <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years , than <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the whole <unk> .
If you look at it in the <unk> context , you can see them .
In the last five years we &apos;ve been <unk> million <unk> of CO2 <unk> every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the oceans .
And you look at the area of the <unk> <unk> , to <unk> , and on both of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where there is a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the oceans .
The greater cause of the global warming , together to <unk> , which is 20 percent of them , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And you can <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
But we &apos;re trying to a <unk> of the <unk> .
These are the projects that are the <unk> in the last few years and some of <unk> <unk> .
Every way , there is a political <unk> in our country .
The <unk> of <unk> and oil have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I saw something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where live , there was a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
Maybe you saw it on the <unk> .
This is the second largest flow of <unk> in America .
It &apos;s been <unk> around <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> . â™« <unk> is a <unk> , <unk> .
It &apos;s been <unk> here in America , and it &apos;s <unk> our economy .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> .
It &apos;s at good price , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Al <unk> : From here , it &apos;s a lot of <unk> <unk> .
The largest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> clear -- Al <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
<unk> : So , the <unk> for the <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , one of them .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> , we see the climate change as a <unk> <unk> .
This is the way we have <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to public health and <unk> the truth .
Actually , <unk> is <unk> .
We think it &apos;s <unk> -- it &apos;s got a good <unk> .
So , we don &apos;t change the climate change .
We could do that .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you &apos;ve heard about it a lot of it .
So , I &apos;m going to take a turn into a <unk> , as it &apos;s about <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> are a little <unk> , but this is the sound of <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> is between the main <unk> of global warming , but the <unk> technology of <unk> that you see changes everything .
And let &apos;s look at a look at this : this is the <unk> technology .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security .
<unk> : <unk> : America is in the crisis ; the economy , national security , the national security crisis .
The <unk> that all of them : our <unk> from <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and oil <unk> .
Now , there &apos;s a new one , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent <unk> energy , 10 years .
A plan for <unk> America to work , <unk> more <unk> , and help <unk> the global <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we could solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
<unk> : This is the last .
<unk> : This is about <unk> energy .
One of the most <unk> ways to <unk> the end of <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , a new network .
<unk> <unk> 2 : <unk> <unk> <unk> for jobs well .
<unk> : <unk> America . It &apos;s time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A <unk> <unk> says , &quot; If you want to go , go for yourself .
If you want to go far , you go , go together . &quot;
We have to go far , fast .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year I made a <unk> on <unk> .
And I &apos;m trying to <unk> to <unk> about how the machine works .
So I got there . And for the people who were not there , the <unk> is the largest experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were present , less than a <unk> <unk> from the beginning of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second .
This is just <unk> .
This is the camera on <unk> .
<unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk> .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> feet , and it &apos;s got <unk> feet <unk> .
This is a <unk> picture of <unk> in construction . And you can see the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of last year , we &apos;ve been <unk> the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in control room .
It &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> of particles , and they had <unk> all over the <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> in <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles into the <unk> .
In other words , when you look at that image , you know , you &apos;ll see that the camera , which is a big <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if that was this to make us <unk> , or something about Google and they would say , the <unk> page was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a <unk> impact on the scientific .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to just these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine works at the <unk> of <unk> .
Now , the <unk> of you <unk> the <unk> and <unk> , &quot; It &apos;s not true . I &apos;m <unk> too <unk> . &quot;
And they can do that because when they &apos;re very <unk> to become the <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees , at a temperature <unk> to that of the space between stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> of the most <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think that these are going to be more than 20 <unk> , and that &apos;s about 30 <unk> .
They &apos;re about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we then did .
We &apos;ve <unk> them and <unk> .
Now they &apos;re now <unk> everybody in their <unk> .
<unk> the end of <unk> , the <unk> is going to be new <unk> .
We <unk> it , and we <unk> to get data to <unk> or <unk> , and continue so our <unk> to find out what are the <unk> that we would <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in some way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering . It &apos;s easy to <unk> .
I think that &apos;s so hard , the fact , the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact , the value of things like <unk> .
I want to end with the words of a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> , <unk> , in <unk> of <unk> experiments of his <unk> , his <unk> was <unk> , said , &quot; No , it &apos;s so <unk> for the human mind how the science of the human mind how the <unk> of science are <unk> , and that there are no <unk> in nature , and that we don &apos;t have new <unk> .
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to <unk> when , from children , <unk> with <unk> .
As we were <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , actually , <unk> , to think and solve <unk> problems .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way most of the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with objects , together with my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started to <unk> : &quot; And if , when we use a computer , instead of having the computer , instead of having the <unk> <unk> as a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> information with both hands ,
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that I wanted to explore the answer , building <unk> .
<unk> , a <unk> is a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , a <unk> is a <unk> <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , you can <unk> them , hear their movement and they have a screen and they have a screen and they have a screen .
But <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> .
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> the digital information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement , the other , and as well as the <unk> , the movement of their movement , how we <unk> them , we can explore their <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
I &apos;ll start with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you about the video . If you put it in one direction , the video <unk> , so if you <unk> on the other side .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , you know , you &apos;re <unk> them .
If they &apos;re <unk> , they can <unk> and they can <unk> a little bit .
If they &apos;re <unk> , they can <unk> and they can <unk> a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We &apos;ve then <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> was the <unk> that you could use common on data , like , &quot; <unk> &quot; a color like that .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as <unk> of <unk> and I can <unk> for color of color in that central , where you get <unk> .
and I can <unk> you to <unk> color in that central .
And we can <unk> it a little bit about it .
There are also <unk> possibilities of <unk> , like <unk> , mathematics and games where people can try things quickly , and <unk> the results immediately .
I &apos;m --
This is a <unk> of <unk> that I do with a <unk> program .
So here we have a game here here , which is half of the <unk> and <unk> .
And it was at every <unk> , you know , at every <unk> , <unk> , at every <unk> , and <unk> a letter to <unk> , and while I was trying to <unk> words on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you &apos;ve got a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try to try and .
Thank you .
And so here &apos;s some children who were <unk> in <unk> <unk> , I did so that I <unk> them and <unk> them a video .
They &apos;re very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things like this <unk> is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just wanted to say , &quot; <unk> of words , &quot; and they exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s some other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , on the right .
It actually wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
I had to build a tool for <unk> . He &apos;s <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So , it &apos;s <unk> the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now , he now led a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : Yeah . Yeah !
So , they <unk> <unk> and <unk> can make the characters --
<unk> : <unk> .
<unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> .
<unk> : It &apos;s a story that &apos;s open with open , and it can tell him how to <unk> .
<unk> : It &apos;s a story that &apos;s open with open , and it can tell him how to <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I &apos;ve been <unk> about is a <unk> , that was made by recently , to <unk> and <unk> music .
It &apos;s a tool , that &apos;s a few recently that we have music .
<unk> <unk> here , <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of these has four different <unk> , and you can choose which to use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of your <unk> .
And it &apos;s just <unk> by doing a <unk> , and a sequence .
These are actually , you can control live , like <unk> and <unk> .
I &apos;ll <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are the <unk> effects of time and <unk> , that &apos;s going to be <unk> to the whole sequence .
<unk> how it works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> one <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> in a series of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , other base .
Now , let &apos;s take a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> . Now <unk> <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> : And now , I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> to the <unk> , so I can control the effect of live .
<unk> : <unk> , I can <unk> the whole time from one side or the other .
<unk> : <unk> : And now we &apos;ll <unk> the <unk> to give more <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the sequence .
So I don &apos;t have to tell you about it , but I can <unk> , you &apos;ll get a long time .
And now , I can <unk> the whole sequence on the left of the <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new <unk> <unk> <unk> more and more <unk> to how they work our brain and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to <unk> is that it &apos;s <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> with media , which <unk> in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and my <unk> of life .
And it doesn &apos;t look like that .
But , said this , something particular happened in my life and career , that led me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I wrote this book , this <unk> called &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which , <unk> from my <unk> books , for some reason that &apos;s been <unk> , for some reason for <unk> in the world and <unk> a big <unk> , <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere we go , people will be <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> .
I &apos;m going to be <unk> and say , &quot; Don &apos;t be <unk> than I do better ?
You don &apos;t have <unk> to go and write all the life that you could create a book that can help you make a book that can <unk> to someone ? &quot;
How could it be <unk> to somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , and I remember that over 20 years ago , when I was trying to say to people -- I was a <unk> -- that I wanted to be a <unk> .
I <unk> to the same <unk> from fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you know , you don &apos;t know how to <unk> ?
Do you have <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
Do you have <unk> to do this <unk> all of life without anything about it , and you &apos;re going to die on a <unk> of <unk> dreams with the mouth of <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> ?
So , you know .
The short answer to all of these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yeah , I &apos;m afraid of all of that .
I &apos;ve always been afraid .
And I also <unk> of a lot of other things that people could not be <unk> .
As <unk> and other things that are <unk> .
But , as far as I was thinking and <unk> , what I thought , you know , what I mean , it &apos;s why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It &apos;s <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a work that you feel about to do .
But what &apos;s so particular about the <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> health <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not do ?
How about my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> , and I don &apos;t remember a time in his <unk> <unk> in his <unk> , where asked if they were afraid to be <unk> ?
There was never -- that <unk> of <unk> John <unk> , how did it go ?
Don &apos;t do that , <unk> ?
<unk> , the engineers like a group of not have certainly , in <unk> , <unk> the <unk> to be <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have enough , we have enough , and not just <unk> , but <unk> of all sorts of <unk> , we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And there &apos;s nothing else that look at the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , young and often <unk> them .
And the ones who are not <unk> to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before I die , in the last <unk> said , &quot; Every my book has <unk> me a little bit more . &quot; One extraordinary <unk> about this work of their life .
But we didn &apos;t know about <unk> when I say it because we &apos;ve heard these things so long that we &apos;ve been <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and creativity <unk> are somehow <unk> and that art , at the end , it , it always <unk> to the <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> to all of them here today is : you &apos;ve got this idea ?
You &apos;re fine -- because it &apos;s also <unk> from a <unk> distance to me not well about this <unk> .
I think it &apos;s <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s also <unk> , and I don &apos;t want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better <unk> our great <unk> to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- in my <unk> situation , would be very <unk> to <unk> towards that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> that I &apos;m in my career .
<unk> -- I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;ve been about 40 years .
I &apos;ve got about four <unk> of work in me .
And it &apos;s very <unk> that whatever you do in the world is <unk> by the world , as the work that we <unk> after my last book .
I was <unk> , because we &apos;re all about here -- is <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> , that thought ,
You know , the kind of thought that leads to a person who is at <unk> <unk> at nine <unk> on the morning , and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I want to keep doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so , it seems to me , after many <unk> , that the way to keep trying to get the <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I &apos;ve got to have a way of <unk> between me , which I &apos;m <unk> , and my natural <unk> that was <unk> on what that was written was going to be done by the time , year models for all last year , trying to find other society to see if you have a <unk> , trying to find other society to see if you have the best ideas and the best ideas .
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research led me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s because it &apos;s going to be <unk> and then it <unk> .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don &apos;t believe that creativity is <unk> by men , OK ?
It turns out that creativity was this <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> to men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for reasons and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you have a <unk> that would be <unk> <unk> from far away .
The <unk> were the same idea , but they were <unk> that sort of spirit of <unk> body .
which is <unk> , because the <unk> didn &apos;t really know that a <unk> was particularly a <unk> somebody was particularly smart .
I thought a <unk> was this sort of <unk> <unk> was <unk> , literally , in the <unk> of a study artist , a little <unk> like <unk> , and that <unk> out to <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the work of that work .
<unk> <unk> , that &apos;s the distance I talk -- that <unk> <unk> you from the results of your work .
And everyone knew it was so <unk> , right ?
So the <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like the too <unk> , right ?
If your work was <unk> , you didn &apos;t want to <unk> all of the <unk> , you all know , you &apos;d have been <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , you know , it was not your <unk> , right ?
Everybody thought it was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people are <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
And then the <unk> <unk> and everything , and I <unk> this great idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe above all and <unk> and no longer to leave space on the <unk> that <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people think that creativity was completely from the <unk> .
And for the first time in history , you start to <unk> this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> person with <unk> .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think I &apos;ll be <unk> to somebody , a simple person to believe that you know , the source , the source of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , is a responsibility to give the human <unk> .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> the <unk> and creates all of these <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure to have been <unk> artists in 500 years .
And if that &apos;s true , and I think , that &apos;s the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do that <unk> ?
They want to go back to a more <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t do it about 500 years of thinking about it .
And there probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> people to <unk> about their projects .
I &apos;m probably not going to tell you all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to tell you is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t we think about this way ?
Because it makes more sense of everything that has ever heard about to explain the <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
A process that , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so , basically , you know , you know , you don &apos;t have to <unk> .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seem completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s been <unk> , and he &apos;s been a <unk> for all of life and said that during his <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out of the fields , and I <unk> it , in the fields , and I <unk> it , in the fields , and I <unk> it , in the fields that they were <unk> .
She said , she was like a <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> to her <unk> to her from <unk> .
I had to get it , because he was <unk> the earth under his feet .
I decided to have one thing to do at that point and it was , words , &quot; <unk> like a <unk> . &quot;
And so he came back home and he came from this <unk> , and he would not have anything else that take a piece of paper and a <unk> <unk> enough , as the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> on the page .
<unk> times , I didn &apos;t want to be enough fast , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> them through and <unk> them through and she would <unk> them through the <unk> , looking at how she said , &quot; another <unk> , &quot; she said , &quot; another <unk> . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this piece of the time , and that was about the time when the was almost <unk> , OK ?
So , it was <unk> at home and it was looking for paper and <unk> them through , and he was trying to <unk> it through , and then he said , that was like , if you <unk> with the other hand and the <unk> .
He <unk> the tail and <unk> in his body and <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk> , but <unk> , from the last word to first .
So when I <unk> <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not all my <unk> process -- I &apos;m not a <unk> .
I &apos;m a <unk> , and my way to <unk> is ; I <unk> it every day and work and work and <unk> and work and <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
But even I , in my <unk> , I &apos;ve <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I thought that &apos;s a lot of you have to do it .
You know , even though the work and ideas would be <unk> me by a certain source , I could not <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> to it so we can &apos;t <unk> the head , but rather , that &apos;s <unk> us to make it <unk> ?
And as far as I , the best example of the <unk> that I have been <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;ve been <unk> several years ago for a <unk> .
I was talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the artist <unk> <unk> , trying to control , these sort of <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> completely <unk> .
But then <unk> , he <unk> , and he was <unk> on a day , and he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , <unk> everything .
<unk> fast and everything about a <unk> <unk> , this little <unk> of <unk> , who &apos;s in his head like <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and <unk> , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and <unk> , but it doesn &apos;t know how to <unk> .
It has not a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , it has not <unk> .
So , it starts to hear this old kind of old <unk> , &quot; I &apos;m going to <unk> , and I &apos;m going to <unk> , and I &apos;m going to <unk> this song .
I &apos;m not <unk> enough , and I can &apos;t <unk> . &quot;
And instead of going to go to the <unk> , you know .
He made something completely new .
She just <unk> the sky and said , &quot; <unk> , you don &apos;t see that I &apos;m <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Do you think it can write a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , I &apos;m going to take care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> more .
<unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And his process was going to happen to be <unk> after this .
It was not the work , it was still <unk> as always as a way .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> had been <unk> when they <unk> , the <unk> that out of him , he <unk> , he was <unk> , and he would <unk> it back where it was , you know , it was not supposed to be a <unk> thing and <unk> .
but <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this thing <unk> and <unk> , but it was not <unk> .
So how much I &apos;ve been <unk> to change a little bit , the way I &apos;m going to <unk> and I already <unk> it .
This idea , I was <unk> , when I was <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; and I was in one of those <unk> <unk> in which we &apos;re all working in something and we &apos;re working on something , and we &apos;re not going to be a <unk> , that &apos;s the <unk> book .
Not just <unk> , just the book wrote .
And we started to think about <unk> this project .
But then I was <unk> to <unk> that <unk> to the air and <unk> .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my face to a <unk> corner of the room .
And I said <unk> , &quot; <unk> , what , both of us and that if this book is not going to be <unk> , not that ?
Because as you see , I &apos;m going to take you see that I have , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know , I don &apos;t do anything .
I started writing the same because it &apos;s my job .
And I &apos;d like to please that it was <unk> that I &apos;ve been <unk> to do my own part . &quot; Because -- it &apos;s so , OK , so -- it &apos;s so , you know , you know , the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> , and music that they would be <unk> for <unk> for <unk> and hours to <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every so much , <unk> , something that &apos;s <unk> , and one of these artists actually <unk> .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you &apos;ve all got it , at some point , a <unk> like this .
It was like time , and the <unk> <unk> through a sort of <unk> and it wasn &apos;t doing anything different from the usually , like <unk> <unk> first , but everything <unk> .
And suddenly it doesn &apos;t <unk> as just a human .
But it <unk> from <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people would say what was , they would say , they would say ,
<unk> hands and <unk> to <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , they <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> from &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; to &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; to &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which you still can hear in <unk> or in <unk> .
In <unk> , when a artist has done something impossible and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
And it &apos;s <unk> because we need it .
But the problem comes the day , the problem is coming up , when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s just a <unk> with a big <unk> to <unk> , and maybe you never get more to the <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God , while <unk> , and what &apos;s going to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so <unk> if you can &apos;t believe , you know , <unk> , that the most <unk> <unk> of your being come from you .
But let &apos;s just show you that data from a <unk> of this <unk> part of your life that you &apos;ve got to <unk> when you &apos;re finished .
And , you know , if we think of this way that we think about this all changes .
And so I started <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> like I &apos;ve been <unk> for several months during the book , that I was <unk> soon , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
And what I have to keep <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , not being <unk> .
I don &apos;t know . It &apos;s just your work .
You &apos;re going to <unk> for your <unk> , any of you can .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If you <unk> , you &apos;ll be <unk> to you <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for one moment through your <unk> , then you &apos;re going to <unk> .
<unk> , you make the same <unk> .
And &quot; <unk> ! &quot; to you do that .
I think , and I think , you know , <unk> <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; You know , just for <unk> human and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> .
As you know , I &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects about the human genome , what it can be <unk> and discovery of <unk> genes .
We &apos;re <unk> a new way , we &apos;ve started to <unk> biology and now starting from that digital code , we &apos;re <unk> in a new <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> life .
We &apos;ve always been trying to <unk> big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; is something that many <unk> I think have <unk> to understand various levels .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> terms .
We &apos;re <unk> from almost 20 years now .
When we <unk> the human genome , we <unk> the human genome to the digital world of computer biology .
Now , we &apos;re going to <unk> life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> species of the most <unk> genome that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> a more small one .
We can <unk> a <unk> of <unk> of about 500 <unk> that are here .
But when we look at his <unk> map , it &apos;s just <unk> with it .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at a time , it &apos;s very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell .
So I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> so that they could <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of &quot; Can we <unk> a <unk> ? &quot;
Can the chemistry <unk> to produce these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And in case , <unk> , can make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> material .
The speed that we &apos;re able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the code , instead , <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> .
And our most <unk> results get on a <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve been <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> before the first time .
But we found that DNA <unk> is very difficult .
There are thousands of thousands of machines in the world that <unk> little <unk> of DNA , of <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> process : the more <unk> is a process : the more <unk> is there .
So we had to develop a new way to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , from the digital information that &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a little <unk> that you <unk> bacteria .
We designed <unk> , <unk> the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of about <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part of it is when we &apos;ve taken this piece of <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> it in bacteria , bacteria have <unk> this <unk> and <unk> the <unk> particles .
<unk> particles have been then <unk> by cells , they &apos;re <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ve talked about the <unk> <unk> <unk> that they &apos;ve been doing this model .
They have more than you .
I think this is a situation where the software can really build its own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we could do things in big .
I had to build the whole <unk> of <unk> .
They are more than <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
So we thought we could <unk> in the size of the virus , so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> are the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> information into a computer , these things to be very <unk> .
When you <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> , the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> .
We found out , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If we could use that original sequence , you could never be able to do it .
One of the process is designing <unk> <unk> 50 <unk> that you <unk> with all the other <unk> of the <unk> to build smaller <unk> than <unk> together .
<unk> elements here .
You probably have read that you &apos;ve seen <unk> of <unk> .
So , we have a <unk> code that <unk> on four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> and <unk>
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , and there &apos;s a <unk> order of <unk> <unk> , and there &apos;s a <unk> order to <unk> each <unk> .
So we can use the code for writing , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did was we did at the beginning , it was <unk> .
Some of them have been <unk> by the fact that it was not <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started <unk> in <unk> , <unk> with <unk> from five to seven <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to them to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , at any step in this <unk> , so that we &apos;re <unk> to create a very <unk> <unk> , as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to <unk> the process .
So , this seems to be the <unk> of a <unk> .
When I was <unk> to these <unk> , more than 100 <unk> <unk> , they don &apos;t get <unk> directly into the <unk> <unk> .
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> biology .
So we &apos;ve got <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , who in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA to <unk> the <unk> .
Here &apos;s an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , it can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> like his <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
In 12 hours , it &apos;s been <unk> as it was before .
<unk> of thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely .
<unk> to live under <unk> .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and you &apos;re <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
Actually , NASA , showed that this happens .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we built using these <unk> , just using the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a big <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we &apos;ve done a little bit of time ago .
They are more than <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
It &apos;s the largest <unk> of a <unk> structure ever <unk> by man .
It has a <unk> weight over 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a 10 <unk> , you &apos;ll just <unk> pages to <unk> this <unk> code .
Now , how do we make it work ?
<unk> , of course , there is a <unk> game .
It &apos;s a little bit more <unk> when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s <unk> cells , even when it &apos;s about <unk> cells like that : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the <unk> process .
In <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> , instead of <unk> in the cell , but we &apos;ve <unk> that we can do a <unk> <unk> from one cell <unk> into another and <unk> .
We &apos;ve <unk> a <unk> <unk> by a <unk> species .
The two different are how men from <unk> .
We &apos;ve <unk> some <unk> more so we &apos;ve got some <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
He then <unk> it with <unk> so he could <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> . And we <unk> our <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> our <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
And <unk> <unk> that we didn &apos;t want to go beyond , but we tried to <unk> more .
This is one of the biggest <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a <unk> or a third <unk> somewhere , and <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So who thinks evolution as one <unk> at a time you get <unk> , it doesn &apos;t really understand much of biology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell couldn &apos;t do one .
The <unk> <unk> that we <unk> it .
It &apos;s <unk> , and it has <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material , and we &apos;ve been <unk> with only the cell that &apos;s going to be the new <unk> .
has become blue because of the genes that we &apos;ve <unk> .
And in a short <unk> , all of the <unk> of a species , you know , you &apos;ve got all been <unk> in a new species , <unk> on the software that we &apos;ve <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code that you <unk> <unk> exactly what we &apos;ve been <unk> .
Now , this could be <unk> <unk> , but we <unk> the software DNA , we can change things <unk> enough .
Now , I &apos;ve already <unk> that you don &apos;t talk about <unk> -- but about <unk> from three million years and a half a <unk> of evolution , and I said that we &apos;re going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> in this digital process , where we <unk> new species to <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , new species <unk> on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s quite <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion and a half billion people to <unk> billion in the next 40 years .
Just to give you an example : I was born in <unk> .
Now , there are three people on the planet to <unk> in <unk> ; it &apos;s going to be four .
We &apos;re <unk> now to find food , water and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , six billion people .
We &apos;re even more <unk> to do it for nine billion .
We &apos;re going to be more than five billion <unk> , over 30 billion <unk> .
That means percent of <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process to <unk> , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
In more , we have to realize that we have to <unk> all of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
And so on today , because of the <unk> <unk> all over the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that &apos;s the <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry , just <unk> <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here are data from <unk> , and our imagination .
We now have <unk> , because of these <unk> <unk> of <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think of <unk> these 20 million <unk> of different <unk> or <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology that &apos;s been <unk> for the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> , <unk> <unk> , chemistry or chemistry , <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we &apos;re working on to be able to <unk> and design species at the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how to be .
We know exactly what their <unk> code .
We &apos;re <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
You saw this one of <unk> <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We &apos;ve <unk> <unk> and third generation that we &apos;ve been <unk> enough to <unk> from the <unk> to <unk> more <unk> than <unk> or <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> , it would be <unk> CO2 in matter before , which we &apos;re working on designing for designing cells , and we think we can get the first <unk> of the first generation of <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> solar <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> of <unk> all over the world , we &apos;ve found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk> .
It &apos;s going to be in the ocean at about <unk> feet of <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> by using hydrogen <unk> as energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2 , that can easily be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , we <unk> think that we could be able to <unk> what the basic question , what is life is , we , we have the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole <unk> of <unk> the whole <unk> .
<unk> . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t ?
It &apos;s a main source of energy .
<unk> , we &apos;re working on the way we &apos;re working on using the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk> .
You saw this year with the flu , we always went back to a year and a dollar less <unk> when it comes to find the right <unk> .
I think what you can change is building <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
That &apos;s how the future could start to look at <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and finally <unk> cells .
We &apos;re so <unk> from <unk> people .
Our purpose is to do so much of a living long enough to try to <unk> it . Thank you very much .
First of all , I &apos;m going to show you , the most fundamental work , some fundamental work , of the new technology that we &apos;ve taken to <unk> <unk> to a year ago . This is <unk> .
This is a environment in which you can think is on local level that &apos;s a huge amount of data <unk> .
We &apos;re seeing here <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> with a sort of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a <unk> fast , <unk> <unk> the images as we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big it is the amount of information that we see , how big the <unk> of data or <unk> .
Most of the <unk> , but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen . It &apos;s also very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , which is not about images .
This is <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , to <unk> that &apos;s what it &apos;s about images , we can do such a thing , to make a real <unk> of the text , not a picture .
This could be a little bit of a <unk> to read a book .
I don &apos;t <unk> it .
This is an example of the <unk> . This is a number of The <unk> .
Every image of the great is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the good experience to read the real <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a kind of <unk> .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of The <unk> .
We &apos;ve created a <unk> <unk> much higher than what you use in a normal <unk> , and we &apos;ve <unk> to you in the <unk> of the <unk> .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see them here .
or another models , or even the <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
I thought this would be to put the end to the <unk> and other <unk> , not to be <unk> .
Of course , <unk> is one of the most <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this one I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say we have <unk> <unk> to give in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> on top of the NASA <unk> .
So now we &apos;re going to try something else .
This is actually live on the web ; you can see it .
This is a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a very interesting <unk> research at the very interesting computer research , a very interesting <unk> , a student of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s live on the web , <unk> .
You can see when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of experience <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here actually , a meaning .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> , and these things are <unk> together , so that they <unk> to <unk> places where they <unk> all close to the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk> . So here you see some <unk> <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> data of <unk> and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that we &apos;ve done for the first summer , to show you what <unk> is really the key behind this technology , the <unk> technology , the <unk> . And it &apos;s not <unk> , looking at the <unk> that we &apos;ve put in the website . And it &apos;s not <unk> <unk> , looking at the website .
We had to <unk> some <unk> and so forth .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and so forth . <unk> of these <unk> <unk> and so forth . <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> a picture that you have an image .
So they &apos;re all <unk> by <unk> and they &apos;ve been all <unk> on the <unk> level this way .
And it &apos;s possible to <unk> this way .
You know , I would never thought I &apos;d be working for <unk> .
It &apos;s very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think we &apos;ll see that this is a lot of different kinds of <unk> : that &apos;s cell phone to those <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I can get them to look at those <unk> .
Many are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
And some of the way here , you have a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from <unk> to the physics of this environment .
The <unk> point is that we can do things with the social environment . This is now <unk> data from the whole <unk> memory of how to <unk> the earth , from the whole <unk> of how to <unk> the Earth , from the <unk> view and <unk> all that data together .
All those pictures become <unk> together , greater of the <unk> .
You have a model of the Earth .
Think about this as the <unk> of <unk> &apos;s work on Earth .
It &apos;s something that we &apos;ll <unk> in complexity as people will <unk> it , and the <unk> for those who <unk> it with use .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people .
If somebody comes the idea of <unk> all of these <unk> , the name of <unk> <unk> <unk> , you know , my picture of <unk> <unk> , you know , I can use the <unk> to <unk> in that space , in that <unk> , using the pictures of anyone else , and have a social <unk> kind of <unk> and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all this is , very <unk> <unk> of every part interesting about the Earth , it &apos;s not just by <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized what your software will tell us to do is that at some point , in the next few years , all the photographs that are <unk> in the world , are all <unk> together , <unk> are going to be <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is there , it &apos;s <unk> .
It &apos;s creating <unk> , if you want , you know , it &apos;s <unk> .
And it &apos;s doing it on the content of the images .
And it becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> information that a lot of these <unk> images .
As you make a research on images on the web , you get a <unk> and the text on the web has a lot of information about images .
Now , what &apos;s going on that picture you &apos;re going to look at all your pictures ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really huge . It &apos;s a <unk> effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it &apos;s really incredible . <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> you very much .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the research <unk> is the way to live between who has not <unk> <unk> , between those who have <unk> the past the wind , <unk> it in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> in the <unk> of plants .
We think that <unk> <unk> still <unk> more beyond the <unk> <unk> , or that the <unk> of <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , or that in <unk> , the <unk> still <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , and that the idea that we live in there is no sense , but it &apos;s just a model , it &apos;s just a model , but it &apos;s just a model ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , well or bad , many <unk> does .
And , of course , everybody was <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . Everybody <unk> . Everybody <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We have to deal with the <unk> of death , so we don &apos;t know if we could <unk> and <unk> --
We all have an art .
What <unk> is the particular <unk> of the song , the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of <unk> .
He was my <unk> <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> , the mother &apos;s <unk> .
All of these <unk> are <unk> that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving into the world .
And if you <unk> a second , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of <unk> of the world as a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> the planet and it &apos;s important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> known as <unk> <unk> .
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , ideas , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> in being by human imagination .
<unk> is the fantastic <unk> of humanity .
It &apos;s the <unk> of what we can be , and what we can be as <unk> species .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> much faster .
<unk> <unk> , for example , that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the <unk> of <unk> , because it &apos;s <unk> , or -- in the <unk> <unk> -- in the <unk> of the diversity -- and they don &apos;t even know about the <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> diversity .
The <unk> of this is , of course , <unk> <unk> .
When you &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
One language is not just by a language <unk> or a series of rules .
One language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of the <unk> that the culture of every culture comes in the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we &apos;re sitting here at <unk> , at least half is not <unk> in the <unk> of children .
They don &apos;t get <unk> to children , which means they &apos;re not going to be <unk> , unless you know something , already has been death .
What &apos;s more <unk> about being <unk> by <unk> , of the last few of being <unk> , of the last few language , not to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or to <unk> the <unk> of children ?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of some of some of the world every two weeks , every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> , and it <unk> with it in the <unk> <unk> of a language <unk> .
And I know that somebody you say , &quot; <unk> &apos;t that better ?
The world would not be a better place if you <unk> all the same language ? &quot; <unk> , we all talk . <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> of a <unk> thing that means , you can &apos;t talk about your language .
I &apos;d like to show you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we &apos;re <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say &quot; different ways of <unk> . &quot; I mean different ways of <unk> .
So , for example this <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , who <unk> to the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> that it &apos;s not able to <unk> the blue color from green because the time <unk> is <unk> in the forest because the <unk> is <unk> in the forest , which we <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; : you have to <unk> a person talking about a language .
And this has been <unk> in the past <unk> , but the <unk> is that in these <unk> <unk> where you &apos;re talking about <unk> or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> nobody basically <unk> .
You can start listening and then I started talking .
I was one of the most interesting <unk> that I lived with , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> contact with a <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;ve been made <unk> <unk> photographs that <unk> them in <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> forest had never seen anything .
They <unk> the <unk> pictures of the land , they <unk> to a form or a <unk> , they didn &apos;t know anything , they <unk> that they <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with the <unk> .
But <unk> are not only <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> with them .
<unk> percent <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We went back to eight <unk> and we found two cases of <unk> . And when we <unk> to know , they &apos;ve been <unk> to know , they &apos;ve been so much <unk> , and then they <unk> it .
<unk> were able to <unk> the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and to <unk> species .
<unk> years early &apos; <unk> , it was a really interesting task when my <unk> <unk> <unk> , if I wanted to go to <unk> between the <unk> society and the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> to use the <unk> .
To make sense of <unk> , I should have to understand the <unk> culture , and that <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a pretty <unk> view of the world .
Very interesting .
If you ask about <unk> the big <unk> of the world , what about ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that <unk> is not <unk> <unk> . And instead , and the <unk> is not the other one that <unk> of these <unk> <unk> very <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
What makes interesting is that <unk> is the relationship between life and death .
So <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> to live in the <unk> of <unk> live so that for a second <unk> becomes the <unk> .
That &apos;s why <unk> <unk> <unk> to say , &quot; <unk> <unk> go to talk about God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re <unk> , is the spirit that you &apos;re <unk> , how do you can get you of <unk> ?
So you &apos;re <unk> to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather strong <unk> of power of mind <unk> <unk> a rather strong <unk> of power of mind .
I <unk> all the <unk> that I &apos;ve been lived with the most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> <unk> , that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> was never <unk> by <unk> .
And so , I &apos;m <unk> from a <unk> , but their education is extraordinary <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> from <unk> to three or four years , and they live in a world that was made of <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the base of the <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> of the <unk> years of <unk> , by <unk> the nine months of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of mother , now are <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
And so , for all this time , they &apos;re <unk> to values that their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or just their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say <unk> <unk> .
And so , in the term at the end of this incredible <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> out of 18 years , they see a <unk> . And in that moment of the first <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> , all the <unk> of the <unk> , everything that they learned in the <unk> . It &apos;s about all that &apos;s <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ? <unk> , how I said . &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> . Now it &apos;s <unk> to you . &quot;
They &apos;re called <unk> greater <unk> and they say , we &apos;re the <unk> of the world &apos;s <unk> .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think about <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the old <unk> history of <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> in his <unk> or maybe <unk> and say that these are closer to Earth .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by <unk> .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or the <unk> <unk> , but because of time and <unk> , have created a <unk> of Earth <unk> , that &apos;s <unk> on the <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> , the idea that the Earth can only be because it &apos;s <unk> by human <unk> .
What does this mean ?
I mean , a <unk> <unk> that <unk> the mountain is a very <unk> spirit that <unk> its <unk> is a different human , and it will have a very different relationship with the mountain or that would be a different relationship with the mountain or that <unk> <unk> that <unk> that a mountain is to be <unk> .
<unk> of a <unk> , or a <unk> is <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> to be <unk> .
That made me a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> that live north <unk> , and the <unk> who live north <unk> .
If we start to <unk> that these <unk> can create different , we could actually start to understand some of their <unk> <unk> . They <unk> this <unk> .
I &apos;ve been <unk> this picture by <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
Some of you have heard about <unk> , the most powerful <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What makes it fascinating is not the potential of <unk> , but its <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> from two elements .
On one hand , this <unk> <unk> that has a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> you have a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit , but it &apos;s <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> &apos;s family said <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you ever see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , the <unk> that &apos;s <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . <unk> &apos;t creates a <unk> of <unk> .
I often talk to my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the &apos; <unk> in <unk> .
My <unk> is not <unk> , you can &apos;t <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you &apos;re done , you can &apos;t tell anybody to be <unk> . <unk> , but they can &apos;t be <unk> because they &apos;re <unk> by a <unk> that is , of course , <unk> , <unk> .
You can only <unk> if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now , it &apos;s the <unk> that you find in this <unk> are <unk> of <unk> , the same kind of necessary <unk> . The question <unk> : is a <unk> <unk> . The question <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> species , like these <unk> to two <unk> don &apos;t like that , but if you <unk> in this way , they create <unk> version that is <unk> .
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can be <unk> .
But if you <unk> to the <unk> , we &apos;ll talk to you .
What does this mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that our eyes were <unk> in the forest , and our eyes were <unk> in the same species .
If you <unk> it as they <unk> their <unk> , they would like to <unk> us , you know , you don &apos;t know everything ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take the <unk> <unk> in a <unk> of the full moon and <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
So , with this one , you can &apos;t get <unk> , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , &#91; the problem &#93; is that the ones who have to us <unk> <unk> them , but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of history of our real world than our real world , and it <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk> , but rather like the was that we <unk> and we &apos;ve <unk> or <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the diversity and <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a new <unk> for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> and they <unk> <unk> , so they can &apos;t be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It &apos;s the power .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you look at a look at the world , you &apos;ll see that these are not <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> <unk> out of <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk> .
I thought he was <unk> to <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that lived in the forest <unk> to a generation ago , and now you can see the <unk> of the <unk> , where you can see the <unk> from the <unk> that seems to be <unk> <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> that seems to be <unk> <unk> out to the <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> discovery .
If we <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the <unk> <unk> of political <unk> .
As <unk> <unk> , <unk> physics , <unk> physics , is <unk> to <unk> level , but <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> &apos;s <unk> , but <unk> , <unk> of <unk> &apos;s <unk> , not just <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it &apos;s part of the development of the development of <unk> .
And you can &apos;t understand the <unk> <unk> until you go out of the beginning .
I &apos;ve got the <unk> miles from <unk> in China in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> <unk> , I realized what &apos;s behind .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> at <unk> <unk> .
which means that it has been <unk> to the Chinese time .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that led to <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and her <unk> was <unk> .
It was taken of <unk> in <unk> at the age of two <unk> under his <unk> , because he couldn &apos;t live without having to live without <unk> .
The <unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> .
One day , he <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to work for seven years .
The pain of <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> of <unk> is from <unk> present .
<unk> , all of all , you get to a choice .
Do you have to live in the world <unk> or we want to <unk> the world &apos;s <unk> diversity of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> , before he died said that his greatest fear was , in our <unk> to go to this <unk> view of the world , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination , at a <unk> <unk> , that there were other possibilities .
And it &apos;s <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , who gave us <unk> to the <unk> , who made us <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has to <unk> 300 years .
That <unk> history didn &apos;t tell me that we have the answers all the challenges that <unk> to go .
When these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human , you know , <unk> with <unk> different <unk> .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all <unk> the possibilities of being what we are : a <unk> species , which has to <unk> that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can be <unk> . And there are big moments of <unk> .
I took this picture on the <unk> <unk> of the island of <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> me the wonderful story of her <unk> .
The government was not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the &apos; <unk> to <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man is <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> for her life , <unk> all the <unk> away all of his <unk> , and all of his <unk> .
We want to know that <unk> don &apos;t get the cold , you know .
The <unk> <unk> were made of fish <unk> fish .
The <unk> of this man didn &apos;t <unk> from night or <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> away , it &apos;s <unk> the <unk> in skin of <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did <unk> , he <unk> them by , he &apos;s <unk> by it by it .
He &apos;s <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> and when he was <unk> <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> had created a <unk> , he <unk> another dog , and he &apos;s <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> you talk to <unk> with nothing ? &#91; <unk> &#93; And this , in different ways , &#91; is the &#93; <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> the larger California , and the <unk> of <unk> , and they <unk> together .
It &apos;s their new <unk> . It &apos;s called <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s all the <unk> resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , finally , I think , it &apos;s quite <unk> to the people who are in these <unk> areas of the planet , <unk> that are not all <unk> .
And so , for somebody is home .
<unk> <unk> of human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the time . And for all of us , the dreams of our children , they become part of the <unk> <unk> of hope .
<unk> , we <unk> <unk> we are <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to nothing .
I think <unk> --
&#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; are not <unk> , but we think stories can change the world , and perhaps we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; site &#93; <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public in places to <unk> our public <unk> of <unk> from which <unk> to <unk> from how much they &apos;ve seen and , <unk> for a <unk> world &apos;s <unk> in <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , the world &apos;s <unk> in a <unk> world , and we need to find a <unk> world in a <unk> world and <unk> .
where the <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you &apos;ve already heard of and <unk> <unk> , in fact , you don &apos;t know them .
I want to start with what I call the &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
<unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all society <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> : &quot; If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens . &quot; The way to do it is to <unk> freedom <unk> . &quot;
The reason is , from one side , in fact that freedom is itself a value , is useful , useful , <unk> , <unk> for human beings .
And there &apos;s the fact that if we &apos;re <unk> , each of us can do anything that we can do it for our <unk> , not nobody who <unk> in our <unk> .
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> .
More choices , people have , more are <unk> , and more of them is their <unk> , the more <unk> , is their <unk> .
This , <unk> , it &apos;s so <unk> <unk> in society that nobody would <unk> to <unk> in <unk> .
And it &apos;s also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I had a simple note on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> that nobody is <unk> <unk> .
That &apos;s what the <unk> is what the <unk> .
Then you go to the store , you go to buy a <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there &apos;s a big number of <unk> .
We can make six million different and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one <unk> .
<unk> <unk> that there is choice .
<unk> fields : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the <unk> services , <unk> <unk> , who were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
You know , you know , you don &apos;t get it .
And a <unk> of that , by the way , was that the phone never <unk> .
These days have gone .
We have now a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , especially between cell phones .
That &apos;s the mobile phones of the future .
My <unk> is in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
If you don &apos;t have this yet seen in the house , you &apos;re very <unk> that you &apos;re very soon .
And what happens is that people get into the <unk> and they &apos;re doing this question . And they do you know what the answer is ? The answer is &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do anything .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , you get the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : It doesn &apos;t happen in the United States that you &apos;re <unk> from <unk> and <unk> <unk> you have to do .
Instead , <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> says , &quot; OK , we could do A , or <unk> , &quot; A <unk> , &quot; <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You said , &quot; <unk> , what would you do ? &quot;
And the <unk> says , &quot; A <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> and <unk> <unk> these <unk> and <unk> . &quot;
&quot; What do you do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; You know , if you were me , what would you say ? &quot;
And the <unk> : &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
And we call it the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> that makes it look like a good thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not that a <unk> the weight and the responsibility of making decisions from somebody who knows something , <unk> , to <unk> , <unk> , to someone who don &apos;t know -- and it &apos;s <unk> -- and it &apos;s not in the <unk> <unk> to make decisions , which is the patient .
There &apos;s a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me and you , that if you think about it , you know , it doesn &apos;t make sense , because we can &apos;t <unk> .
But if we can &apos;t <unk> , why can we <unk> them ?
The answer is , they want to <unk> , we call the <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of this <unk> as it is our <unk> now is a <unk> of choice , as you see in this <unk> . &quot; We don &apos;t want to <unk> children . &quot; We don &apos;t want to <unk> the children . We don &apos;t want to <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times we can do it .
That means that every <unk> , at <unk> , you have to decide what you want to be a person to be .
I was <unk> to the family and <unk> , a time perspective , <unk> at almost to anyone , was that you could get the <unk> <unk> as soon as possible ,
The only one true choice was with who , not , and not , what to do after that .
<unk> , everything is really to play .
<unk> , <unk> students , and they <unk> them , 20 percent less of work than a time .
And they &apos;re not <unk> , because they &apos;re not <unk> , they &apos;re not <unk> .
but why I &apos;m <unk> , I &apos;m going to ask you , &quot; Do you want to do that now ? Do you do it now ? &quot;
&quot; Do you want to think before ? I have to think before your children or career ? &quot;
They are <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this <unk> don &apos;t <unk> the <unk> that they would <unk> and get a good <unk> to my <unk> .
And they really have to do that . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the job : we &apos;re <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> , because technology can be working every day from the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> , and I don &apos;t say any one , where the <unk> works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this incredible <unk> of choice that we have about this ? Is it that we have to decide , <unk> at any time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son , play with the mobile phone , with a <unk> , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , on the <unk> .
And even though they &apos;re all <unk> , every minute that we see our son , <unk> the <unk> , we &apos;re also trying to , &quot; Do I have to answer this ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this <unk> ? I &apos;ve got to <unk> this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , this makes the experience of your son , very different from what would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the <unk> , and big , objects , materials and <unk> of life , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but not all of choice .
The world today &apos;s <unk> to this : <unk> is this : Is it a <unk> thing , or <unk> ?
The answer is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to <unk> this choice , two effects of people on people .
The first one , <unk> , is that it <unk> instead of <unk> .
With so many <unk> between you , it &apos;s getting very difficult to do it .
I &apos;ll give you an example of <unk> : a <unk> study <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> has had access to data , the <unk> <unk> society , with about a million <unk> <unk> in <unk> different companies .
What you &apos;ve discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are being <unk> in more , the <unk> <unk> <unk> of two percent .
With 50 <unk> , there &apos;s 10 percent <unk> , it &apos;s 10 percent <unk> than when they &apos;re available to five . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> between them , it &apos;s got to decide , and choice <unk> to <unk> .
And <unk> , and still <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> is not coming up .
<unk> that doesn &apos;t mean just these <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> , because they don &apos;t have enough money , they &apos;re not going to say that the decision is so <unk> that they also <unk> the <unk> <unk> of work .
They &apos;re not <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> up to five <unk> <unk> per year from the work , that would be <unk> to <unk> .
So <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices .
And I think it &apos;s going to change the world like this .
&quot; And , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
I could just make the right decision , if it &apos;s for <unk> , isn &apos;t it ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and you &apos;ll get the wrong <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second effect is that even though we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice , at the end we can get <unk> from how to <unk> states with less <unk> .
And that &apos;s the reason for several reasons .
One of these is that with so many <unk> between you , if you <unk> one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy , you can imagine that you could make a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by the decision decision , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> by the decision , and the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> by the decision , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> the decision ,
even when it was a <unk> decision .
The more choices there are , the easier to <unk> than any <unk> that is <unk> of choice .
<unk> , there is what <unk> call .
Dan <unk> very well <unk> how the value we value to <unk> things from what we give them .
And you know , when there are so many <unk> possible , it &apos;s easy to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and be less <unk> about <unk> <unk> that you have <unk> .
So , this is an example . I <unk> with all the ones that are not in New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably <unk> .
There &apos;s this <unk> to <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . It &apos;s all for them .
I don &apos;t know . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; All my <unk> <unk> are away . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> right in front of home . &quot;
And it <unk> two weeks <unk> from the idea that &apos;s <unk> -- every day , the ability to <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> the <unk> for what we have , even when choice was <unk> .
And the more of the <unk> that we have from <unk> , the more the <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
Here &apos;s another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot .
It &apos;s about living the moment , and perhaps of the <unk> of living .
But the most important point is that anything you want , you &apos;re not doing other .
The things that don &apos;t know so many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new <unk> .
It &apos;s about <unk> always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were just one like , and they were <unk> , and they were <unk> , and they were <unk> , just after <unk> a life and I would go well .
So , I &apos;ll go to a couple of new when those <unk> were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> said , &quot; Do you want to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> ? &quot;
Do you want them with <unk> or <unk> ? &quot; <unk> &quot; or &quot; <unk> &quot; ? &quot; or &quot; <unk> &quot;
&quot; Do you want to <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> wants to <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; <unk> <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after some of them , I was like , &quot; I want the only kind of -- that was the only kind of , &quot; it didn &apos;t have any idea what it was like this for a time .
It was <unk> . With all that choice I had <unk> the best .
But I got worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to <unk> .
The reason I was worse was that with all that choice , my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
<unk> I had <unk> . I didn &apos;t know about <unk> when I was just one like , but when I was 100 different , <unk> , at least one of them had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After I had to <unk> what I was <unk> in <unk> , and they were <unk> to <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in life of people don &apos;t do the <unk> that these are <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> .
And this is less <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of <unk> , it makes it <unk> .
Because if I <unk> , I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more about this .
&quot; You were better when you were worse , &quot; The reason you were better when you were worse , you know , you &apos;d better than <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live in -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are at the <unk> .
You &apos;ve never seen <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; Yes , you want to do it . &quot;
I mean -- little <unk> moment -- that I &apos;m really <unk> , my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have <unk> .
But <unk> is not a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of <unk> a couple of <unk> <unk> when there is just that kind of <unk> is that when you &apos;re <unk> , and you say , &quot; Why ? &quot;
Who is <unk> ? &quot; , &quot; The answer is <unk> .
The world is <unk> . What could we do ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of <unk> , and you &apos;ll see one <unk> , and you know , who is the <unk> , it &apos;s clear that you &apos;re .
I could do better .
With hundreds of <unk> <unk> , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even if the <unk> is <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> and they &apos;re <unk> to them .
In the last few years , the <unk> is <unk> in the world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only one , but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is just that people have experiences because the <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation think that <unk> is they think about them .
So the end result is that in general we &apos;re better , <unk> , but we &apos;re even worse .
Let me show you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all get to good and it &apos;s completely <unk> . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no <unk> that some choice is better than not <unk> at all , but it doesn &apos;t know that much choice is better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a <unk> value , <unk> . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve been <unk> by a piece of the level that we &apos;ve been <unk> to our lives .
Now , from the <unk> &apos;s point -- I almost finished -- from the point of view , the <unk> is <unk> .
What allows all this choice in <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you have to <unk> , where the problem is not that they have choice .
The problem is they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> that I &apos;m talking about is a <unk> <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> has talked about yesterday about how <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> are <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> of money .
I mean these choices , <unk> and <unk> , not just <unk> .
They are <unk> <unk> .
They have <unk> .
If some of what we do in our society allows choice to <unk> in those societies , where people have too many possibilities , they don &apos;t just be their lives to <unk> , but our lives .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income is good at all -- not just the poor -- not just to the poor people -- because of this choice in <unk> that we <unk> .
And to <unk> , &quot; <unk> , you can become what you want . &quot;
<unk> , people of culture , <unk> : &quot; What &apos;s the fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s <unk> that you can &apos;t do anything in a glass of glass . &quot;
&quot; A <unk> imagination , a <unk> view of the world --
and <unk> , I <unk> it like this , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I realized that fish know that fish really knows that fish knows a long time .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you <unk> the <unk> , so that &quot; everything is possible . &quot; You don &apos;t know the freedom . &quot;
If you <unk> the <unk> so that you could see everything you could <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
Everybody needs a <unk> .
This is almost certainly almost certainly <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
