<unk> year I showed these <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years , has been the size of the United States , <unk> <unk> , is <unk> 40 percent .
I love this <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a sense , the heart <unk> of climate system .
It <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in summer .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You see , you can see , it <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That &apos;s the ice in <unk> , which <unk> <unk> in summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , five years or more , is like the blood , which here is <unk> from the body .
It &apos;s 25 years in 25 years of past .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> is <unk> around the ocean , where there are huge <unk> of <unk> <unk> that , <unk> , are <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , that <unk> <unk> could <unk> , that amount of <unk> , <unk> this point of not <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> is already <unk> by water .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! Al <unk> : She &apos;s good . The question is , if we <unk> it .
This is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the north .
This is a river in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> never <unk> like that .
This is the <unk> river , in <unk> <unk> .
If you want to know how the <unk> <unk> level to <unk> on <unk> , here is where the sea <unk> .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
On the other side of the planet , <unk> , the largest ice <unk> of the planet .
<unk> month , scientists have <unk> that the ice <unk> is in <unk> , and that the Western <unk> , which <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> at six feet of <unk> , like <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the third largest <unk> <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which a few years ago .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population <unk> water from that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : this <unk> is the source of <unk> water <unk> of this city .
The <unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same happens to <unk> water .
In California <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> 40 percent .
<unk> <unk> are in crisis .
The <unk> , as you read , they &apos;re <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in the world <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and without <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years than <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> .
If you look at it in the <unk> context , you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we have <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every day . 25 million <unk> in the oceans .
Look at the area of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and on both the parts of the <unk> <unk> , where there is a <unk> <unk> oxygen in the ocean .
The biggest cause of global warming , together to <unk> , which is the use of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of two countries with more emissions , together , China .
And you <unk> to build a lot of <unk> <unk> .
But we &apos;re starting to a <unk> <unk> .
These are the projects that are <unk> in the last few years and some <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there is a political <unk> in our country .
The <unk> of <unk> and oil have <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I <unk> image something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where live , there was a <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen on <unk> .
This is the second largest flow in America .
It &apos;s happened around <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> <unk> is a <unk> and happy .
It &apos;s <unk> here in America , and it &apos;s <unk> our economy .
<unk> the <unk> is more <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Al <unk> : From here , it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
The largest <unk> society <unk> on <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al <unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , one part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> , we see the changes as a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
For this <unk> our <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> the truth about <unk> .
In fact , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it &apos;s <unk> -- it also has a good <unk> .
So , it &apos;s not going to change climate change .
We can do that .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you &apos;ve heard about that .
So you &apos;re going to take a <unk> <unk> structure for the <unk> .
<unk> ! The machines are a little <unk> , but this is the sound of <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> , but <unk> technology <unk> that you see everything .
<unk> a look at this , this is the <unk> technology of <unk> .
Al <unk> : <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic and the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> America is crisis , <unk> , national security , <unk> crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all the <unk> : our <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> , like <unk> <unk> and <unk> oil .
Now , but there &apos;s a new one , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan to <unk> America to work , <unk> more <unk> , and help <unk> the global <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we can solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
Al <unk> : This is the last one .
<unk> : <unk> : This is <unk> <unk> energy .
One of the <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> , <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , sun , <unk> , a new network <unk> .
<unk> <unk> two : <unk> <unk> for jobs , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> America . It &apos;s time to be <unk> .
Al <unk> : A <unk> <unk> <unk> says , &quot; If you want to go to alone ,
If you want to go away , you go away , go together . &quot;
We have to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED I did a <unk> on <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to try to <unk> how the machine works .
So I <unk> here . And for those who were not , the <unk> is the greatest experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were present less than a <unk> <unk> from the universe -- to <unk> million times a second .
This is just <unk> .
This is the <unk> machine .
<unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk> .
This is what I work on . It &apos;s called <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> <unk> feet and has a <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> picture of <unk> in construction . And so you can see the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> last year we <unk> the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by <unk> .
It was because of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> of particles that he had made all over the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles in the <unk> .
In other words , when you <unk> that picture , the <unk> <unk> , the machine is a big <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if this was <unk> to make us <unk> , or this , when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the <unk> page was this .
That means we had a <unk> impact over to scientific .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to just these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine works at the <unk> <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you <unk> and <unk> , &quot; It &apos;s not true . I &apos;m <unk> too <unk> . &quot;
And they can do that because when they &apos;re very <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees , at a temperature temperature <unk> to that of the space between stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and that &apos;s about 30 <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s about 50 <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
Now they &apos;re <unk> to their <unk> place .
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> will be again .
We <unk> it , and we <unk> to get <unk> data to <unk> or <unk> , and continue our <unk> to find out what the universe is .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these <unk> <unk> the value of science and engineering <unk> . It &apos;s easy to <unk> .
I think that the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s so hard , I think that the value of things like <unk> .
I want to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> <unk> <unk> experiments in <unk> experiments of his <unk> , his <unk> was <unk> with <unk> experiments in nature , and he said , &quot; No <unk> is that no <unk> for the human mind how <unk> that ideas are <unk> , that there are no <unk> in nature , that our <unk> are <unk> , and that we don &apos;t have .
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> <unk> when , as a <unk> , <unk> with <unk> .
As we <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , actually <unk> to think and solve problems and solve problems .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way most part of the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I started to <unk> , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having the only <unk> <unk> as a digital <unk> that &apos;s moving on a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> that &apos;s <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> a information with both hands ,
and we &apos;re going to <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that I could <unk> the answer , building <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , they can <unk> <unk> , and hear their own movement and they have a screen and radio <unk> .
But <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> <unk> .
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> <unk> to <unk> the digital information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement , and as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement , <unk> of their <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and we can explore their <unk> , and we can explore them explore <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m going to talk to some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you about video , if you put it in a direction , the <unk> video , so if you <unk> on the other side , <unk> <unk> back .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> .
If you <unk> them , they <unk> what it &apos;s them around .
If they come up , they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
If they come up , they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We were then <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> of <unk> was the <unk> that you can use common on data , for example , <unk> <unk> a color like if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> it to <unk> the color in that central , where you <unk> .
and I can <unk> it to <unk> the color in that central , where you <unk> .
And we can <unk> too , we can <unk> a little bit .
There are also <unk> possibilities to <unk> , like <unk> , <unk> , mathematics and games where people can try things , and <unk> the results are going to be <unk> , and <unk> the results immediately .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of <unk> I do with a <unk> <unk> program .
Here we have a game of words that is <unk> half between <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> a letter <unk> a letter <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , at every <unk> <unk> a letter <unk> , and <unk> <unk> a letter <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds <unk> , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try to try .
Thank you .
Here are <unk> children in <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> , I made a video . And I made a video game <unk> .
They &apos;re very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things like this <unk> is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just say , &quot; <unk> of words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s a lot of people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the right there .
It actually wanted to be <unk> .
They were only <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
He had to build a tool for <unk> . He &apos;s <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> <unk> .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now he brought a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! Yeah !
So , you <unk> <unk> and <unk> can make the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with open <unk> , and it can decide how to <unk> it .
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with open <unk> , and it can decide how to <unk> it .
<unk> : <unk> away , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time to show you is a tool that I did , and recently , to <unk> music .
This is a tool , that &apos;s recently done for <unk> and <unk> music .
The <unk> here are <unk> by <unk> like <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of these has four different <unk> , and you can choose what I use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of your <unk> .
And we just <unk> a <unk> sound , a <unk> sequence .
These are actually effects that you can control live , like <unk> and <unk> .
We &apos;re going to <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are <unk> effects as time and <unk> , who <unk> the whole sequence .
It &apos;s going to be like .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m going to take a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> . Now I &apos;m going to <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> : And now I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> , so I can control the effect in live .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the whole sequence of time on one side or another .
<unk> : <unk> : And now we &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> to give <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the sequence of the <unk> .
So I don &apos;t have to tell you about that , but I can <unk> it , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the whole sequence on the left the <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain work and body .
And today , I &apos;ve been <unk> to show you one of this <unk> of this path , and also some possibilities that we &apos;re trying to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to <unk> is that it &apos;s <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> , which <unk> information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to all you .
I &apos;m a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the <unk> of my life .
And it doesn &apos;t look like that it can change .
But , in fact , something particular happened in my life and in my career , and in my career , which has brought me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I wrote this book , this <unk> called &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which , <unk> , &quot; which , <unk> from my <unk> books , for some reason , I &apos;m <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that I &apos;m <unk> now , people like me <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I &apos;m going to go to me and say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear that you &apos;re not going to be able to do better ?
You &apos;re not fear to be able to write all life without being able to create a book that can <unk> someone ? &quot;
What can you get to somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> , you know .
But it could be worse , except I remember that over 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a <unk> -- that I wanted to be a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to go to the same <unk> <unk> .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you know that I don &apos;t know how to have happened ?
Do you fear that the <unk> <unk> <unk> you ?
You &apos;re not fear of doing this <unk> for all life without any of it &apos;s going to be out of <unk> on a <unk> dreams with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
So you know , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I <unk> of all those things .
I &apos;ve always been fear .
And I also <unk> of many other things that people can &apos;t <unk> .
Like <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as I &apos;m talking about the one that I thought and <unk> <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It &apos;s <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you &apos;re born to do .
But what is about so particular in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about health <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not ?
Like my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I don &apos;t remember , once in his <unk> years of activity in <unk> , where the <unk> was asked if they were afraid to be <unk> ?
There was never -- that <unk> of <unk> John , how did it ?
Don &apos;t you like that , <unk> ?
<unk> , the engineers like <unk> don &apos;t certainly have , in <unk> , <unk> the <unk> to be <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> but <unk> <unk> like that , we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And the other people who look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often <unk> to them .
And even the people who don &apos;t seem to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before he died , in the last <unk> said , &quot; Every my book has <unk> me a little more <unk> than a <unk> <unk> about work in their life .
But we don &apos;t know about <unk> when we say it because we &apos;ve heard these things so long that we have <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and creativity <unk> that creativity and creativity <unk> are somehow <unk> and that art , and that art , at the end , I &apos;m going to go to the <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> all over here today is , you agree with this idea ?
It &apos;s all right , because it &apos;s also <unk> by a <unk> distance to me not OK , for nothing .
I think it &apos;s <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s also <unk> and I don &apos;t want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better <unk> our <unk> <unk> to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> that I &apos;m in my career .
<unk> -- look -- look at it &apos;s quite young , I have about 40 years .
I still have about four <unk> of work in me .
And it &apos;s very <unk> that anything you know what you &apos;re going to be <unk> by the world as the work that <unk> after the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we &apos;re all about here -- is <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
You know this is the kind of thought that brings a person to nine <unk> <unk> at nine <unk> and I don &apos;t want to do that .
I continue to continue doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so I think , after many <unk> , that the way to work to continue writing is that to do a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to have a few <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;m <unk> , and my natural <unk> on what I &apos;m <unk> , and I &apos;m <unk> for all last year , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> for all last year , and how to find other society , trying to find other society to see if you have to have some better ideas and more <unk> than <unk> .
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research led me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
because they <unk> in <unk> and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don &apos;t believe that creativity is <unk> by men , OK ?
It <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for reasons <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
The <unk> were about the same idea , but they <unk> that kind of spirit without a <unk> .
which is <unk> , because the <unk> doesn &apos;t really <unk> that a <unk> was particularly <unk> .
And I thought a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> literally in the <unk> of the study of an artist , a little bit like the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> out to <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the <unk> of that work .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , that &apos;s the distance I talk -- that <unk> <unk> you from the results of your work .
And everybody <unk> that was so <unk> , right ?
So , the <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like , for example , right ?
If your work was <unk> <unk> , you &apos;re not going to <unk> the <unk> , you all <unk> that you &apos;d have been <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it was not all <unk> , right ?
Everybody thought it was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> creativity <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and everything <unk> , and we <unk> this great idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe , and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and no longer to let creatures <unk> creatures that are <unk> by <unk> .
This was the <unk> principle of <unk> <unk> and people who think about <unk> creativity .
And for the first time in history , it <unk> to <unk> to this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> , a person with <unk> .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think you &apos;re going to be a simple person , a simple person to believe that they &apos;re like a <unk> like the source , the <unk> and the <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s like to ask someone to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely the <unk> and creates all these <unk> <unk> on <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure to have been <unk> artists in <unk> 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it &apos;s true , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do that <unk> ?
They want to go back to a <unk> understanding of human relationship and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t <unk> 500 years of thinking about <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And there are probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , do you <unk> people <unk> to <unk> <unk> on their projects .
You probably won &apos;t all <unk> on this thing .
But the question I &apos;d like to say to you to <unk> is -- why not ?
Why not you go to this way ?
Because more sense of everything he ever heard about to explain the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And a process that , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so , basically , all here -- you know , you &apos;re not <unk> <unk> .
And in fact , it can sometimes seem completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s now 90 years , but who was a <unk> for all life and said that during his <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the fields , <unk> out in the fields , and I <unk> it , inside the <unk> , and I <unk> it , inside the <unk> , and I <unk> it , inside the <unk> .
She said he was like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> to her <unk> .
And he <unk> it , because he made the land under his feet .
I decided to have one thing to do , and it was , words , &quot; <unk> <unk> as a <unk> . &quot;
And so he went back to home and he was <unk> by this <unk> , and he wouldn &apos;t have anything else that &apos;s going to be <unk> by , and <unk> <unk> on the page .
<unk> times , we &apos;re not going to be <unk> , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without getting to home and <unk> and <unk> the <unk> through and she would <unk> them up through the <unk> , looking for the <unk> , looking for how she said , &quot; another <unk> . &quot;
And then there were times -- this piece never <unk> -- there were times -- there were times when the was almost <unk> , OK ?
So , he was <unk> at home and he was trying to <unk> and <unk> the <unk> through , and he was trying to <unk> a <unk> in the while he was <unk> , and he was <unk> , and he was <unk> with the other hand and the <unk> .
<unk> the tail and the <unk> in his body and <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk> , but <unk> , on the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the word to the first word .
So when you <unk> <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not all my <unk> process -- I &apos;m not a <unk> !
I &apos;m a <unk> , and my <unk> way to <unk> is ; I <unk> at the same time and <unk> and work and <unk> and work <unk> on it .
But even I , in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I think a lot of you <unk> that a lot of you <unk> that .
You know , even though the work and ideas <unk> me <unk> from a certain source , I could not <unk> <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we do it in a way that we don &apos;t do our head , but rather , what do you <unk> <unk> ?
For what I &apos;m about , the best example I &apos;ve <unk> is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;ve <unk> different years ago for a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> <unk> <unk> , trying to control these <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , he <unk> , and one day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> everything for him .
<unk> <unk> and everything about a <unk> <unk> , this little <unk> of <unk> , who comes in his head as he does the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , you know , <unk> , and <unk> , but it doesn &apos;t know how to <unk> .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , it has no <unk> .
So he starts to hear this kind of old <unk> <unk> , and he &apos;s going to lose it , and I &apos;m going to <unk> it from this <unk> <unk> song .
I &apos;m not <unk> and I can &apos;t <unk> . &quot;
And instead of going to <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> the whole process and made something completely new .
She just simply the sky and said , &quot; <unk> , you don &apos;t see that I &apos;m <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Do it seem to be <unk> ?
If you really want to <unk> , you &apos;re going to go back to care when I can take care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> more today .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And his process <unk> <unk> after this .
It wasn &apos;t the work , it was still <unk> as always as a time .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that out of him <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> that was <unk> <unk> , and he had to be <unk> , and he had to be <unk> <unk> .
but <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing and <unk> , but it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
So , how much <unk> history to change a little bit , and the way I &apos;m going to tell you about , and I &apos;m already <unk> .
This idea , I was <unk> when I was <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; and I <unk> in one of those <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we &apos;re working on something , and we don &apos;t start thinking about it , and we &apos;re working on something , and you &apos;re not going to be a <unk> , which will be the <unk> book .
Not only <unk> , the <unk> book written .
And we started thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I &apos;m <unk> to <unk> that <unk> to air and <unk> us .
So I <unk> my face on <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> corner of a <unk> <unk> room .
And I said <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; What , both of course , is that if this is not going to be <unk> <unk> , I &apos;m not going to be <unk> <unk> , I &apos;m not going to be <unk> <unk> , I &apos;m going to be <unk> , &quot; What , is , is , what , is , what , is , is , what , is , is , I &apos;m going to <unk> , &quot; What , is , is , is , is ,
Because you see I &apos;m <unk> everything I &apos;m going to do is I &apos;m not going to do that .
So if you want it to be better , you &apos;ve got to <unk> and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , I don &apos;t <unk> anything .
I started writing the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to please be <unk> that I &apos;m <unk> to do my part . &quot; Because , at the end is like , OK , you &apos;re going to do in the <unk> of Africa , the people <unk> to <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the moon , <unk> music that I <unk> for <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk> .
But every so much , we <unk> something , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you &apos;ve all got to a certain point , a <unk> like this .
It was like time , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it wasn &apos;t doing anything different from the time , like <unk> <unk> <unk> before , but everything <unk> <unk> .
And all of a sudden , not just <unk> as a human .
But it <unk> from <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the fire of <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at times , people <unk> what was , he <unk> it with his name .
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , &quot; God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> by <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
In <unk> , when a artist did something impossible , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
And it &apos;s <unk> because we need .
But the problem comes the day , for the <unk> itself , when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . And the <unk> of God is no longer there .
It &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and maybe never <unk> to that <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God again while <unk> , and what &apos;s going to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s difficult .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so <unk> if you can &apos;t believe , <unk> , <unk> , that the most <unk> <unk> of your being come from you .
But just just <unk> that you &apos;re <unk> data from a <unk> of this <unk> part of your life that <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk> when you &apos;re done .
And , you know , if we think about this , it changes .
And so I started <unk> , and it &apos;s certainly how I <unk> it for different months in the <unk> of the book that <unk> soon , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel <unk> by this is , not fear .
Don &apos;t <unk> . You &apos;re just going to <unk> .
<unk> <unk> for your part , any of it , any can be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , you &apos;re going to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for only one moment through your <unk> , then <unk> ! &quot;
<unk> , you &apos;re doing the same <unk> .
And &quot; <unk> ! &quot; to you <unk> it .
I think and I think , and I think it &apos;s <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; to you know the same , even for having human love and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know I &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , about what it can happen and discovery of new genes .
We &apos;re <unk> a new path . We &apos;re starting to <unk> the biology and now starting from that code , we &apos;re <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We have always tried to <unk> big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that most <unk> <unk> I think have <unk> to understand <unk> <unk> .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
We &apos;re <unk> by almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> that we <unk> from the world of the computer biology in the digital world of computers .
Now , <unk> : can we <unk> life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> a <unk> even smaller .
We &apos;re able to <unk> a <unk> of about 500 people are here .
But when we take a look at his <unk> map , it &apos;s <unk> simple than our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at a time , it &apos;s very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell .
So I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> so that they could <unk> <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions <unk> .
And so we started the <unk> of &quot; Can we <unk> a <unk> ? &quot;
Can the chemistry <unk> to produce these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of material <unk> <unk> .
The speed with which we are able to <unk> the life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the <unk> code , instead , <unk> , <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> .
And our <unk> results can take on a <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve been <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> many <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before the experiments .
But we found that <unk> of DNA is very difficult .
There are thousands of machines in the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> process . <unk> : the more <unk> is a <unk> process . <unk> is : the more <unk> , <unk> are there .
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , starting from the digital information <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a little <unk> that bacteria .
We designed <unk> , <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> material , and we <unk> it in bacteria , bacteria have <unk> this <unk> and <unk> the <unk> particles .
The <unk> particles have been <unk> by cells , they <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I talked about recently with <unk> <unk> industry that they &apos;ve been <unk> this model .
They have more <unk> than you .
And it &apos;s a situation where the software can actually build his <unk> system in a <unk> system .
But we can do things in great .
You could build the entire <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re more than <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we thought we were <unk> in <unk> of <unk> , so that we can change <unk> <unk> to understand what are the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> information with information <unk> in a computer , they need to be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> the <unk> <unk> was of a <unk> <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We found , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If you were used that <unk> sequence , never <unk> to do that .
One part of the process is design <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> <unk> to build smaller <unk> that <unk> together .
<unk> elements here .
You probably read that you have read that <unk> us .
So , we have a <unk> code that <unk> on four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , about 20 <unk> <unk> , and there &apos;s a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk> .
So we can use the <unk> code for writing , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did we do at the beginning was <unk> .
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them <unk> .
And we started <unk> parts , <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to them to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> we made these <unk> <unk> in <unk> so that we &apos;re <unk> to create a very <unk> <unk> as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to <unk> the process .
So this looks like the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When you start these <unk> <unk> , they &apos;re more than 100 <unk> <unk> <unk> , no longer <unk> directly to the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> biology .
So we have <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> the <unk> that we can <unk> the <unk> .
Here &apos;s an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> like his <unk> <unk> .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s <unk> exactly like before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely <unk> .
You can live under <unk> .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and it <unk> to find new <unk> <unk> of water .
In fact , NASA <unk> showed that this is what happens .
This is a picture of <unk> that we built using these <unk> , just using the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s such a big <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we &apos;ve done a little bit of time ago .
They &apos;re more than <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s the largest <unk> <unk> structure ever <unk> by human <unk> .
It has a <unk> weight <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> <unk> <unk> , you &apos;d have to <unk> pages for this <unk> code .
Now , how do we make it work ?
<unk> , <unk> is a <unk> game .
It &apos;s a little bit more <unk> when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s more simple when it &apos;s about cells , <unk> cells like our : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the process of <unk> .
In <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> in the cell , but we <unk> <unk> that we are able to do a <unk> <unk> <unk> from a cell to another and of <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> species .
The two are different than men from <unk> .
We &apos;ve <unk> some <unk> in a way that you could decide what you could have to choose what to do .
He then <unk> it with <unk> <unk> so that he <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> went to the cell .
And <unk> <unk> that we didn &apos;t want to go beyond , but we tried to <unk> more in there .
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So who thinks evolution as a <unk> <unk> at a time <unk> , it doesn &apos;t really understand a lot of biology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> DNA .
The <unk> that was in the cell , they didn &apos;t <unk> one .
The <unk> <unk> we <unk> it .
It &apos;s <unk> , and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> , he <unk> it , and we <unk> with only the cell that has <unk> . And the new <unk> .
It became blue because of the genes that we have <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species <unk> and <unk> it all into a new species , <unk> on software that we <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code that <unk> will be <unk> .
Now , this could be <unk> <unk> , but <unk> the software DNA we can change things in a fairly <unk> .
Now , I &apos;ve already <unk> that there &apos;s no <unk> about <unk> -- but to <unk> progress from three million years and a half million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;ve already said that maybe we &apos;re going to create new species on this process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion people to <unk> billion in the next 40 years .
Just for a <unk> , I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in <unk> ; 40 years , there are four .
We &apos;re going to have to be <unk> now , <unk> water and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> for six billion people .
We &apos;re going to be even more <unk> to do this for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> .
That means 100 million <unk> a day .
When we &apos;re trying to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process to <unk> , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
In more we need to realize that all the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
Al day today , because of <unk> <unk> <unk> around the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future .
The industry <unk> only one <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from reality <unk> and our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , because of these <unk> <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think about these 20 million genes , and try to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology that we can change , because of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> , chemical production or chemistry , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we &apos;re working on to be able to <unk> and design species to computers .
Well , we don &apos;t know how to be .
We know exactly what their <unk> code .
We &apos;re going to be <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
You saw this one that <unk> <unk> from <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We have <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> enough <unk> <unk> , which <unk> enough to <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost of food , and we &apos;re working on doing this . And we &apos;re working on design that they can achieve that , and we think we can get the first <unk> <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> solar <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> all over the world , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> we <unk> in <unk> .
It &apos;s going to be <unk> feet deep ocean , about <unk> meters of water <unk> .
<unk> <unk> from CO2 <unk> using <unk> as <unk> .
We &apos;re trying to understand whether we can easily <unk> CO2 , which can easily be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , we <unk> that we could be able to <unk> what we could <unk> what the question of is , &quot; We , <unk> we have the <unk> <unk> the whole <unk> industry .
<unk> . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can &apos;t do it from TED , where can &apos;t do it from TED , where can &apos;t you .
It &apos;s going to be a major source of energy .
<unk> , we &apos;re working for using the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk> .
You saw this year with flu , we always go back a year and a dollar less <unk> when it &apos;s about finding the right <unk> .
I think that you can change building <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
Here &apos;s how the future could start to look <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> the evolution of <unk> bacteria , <unk> , and then cells <unk> .
We &apos;re so far from <unk> people .
Our purpose is to do a way to live long enough to try to <unk> . Thank you very much .
First of all , I &apos;m going to show you , the <unk> possible , some <unk> work , the <unk> technology that we took to <unk> to a <unk> almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
This is a environment where you can <unk> is at local level that <unk> with a huge amount of data <unk> .
Here we &apos;re seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , for a quick <unk> , <unk> images , <unk> images like we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these <unk> are data <unk> or images .
Most people are common photographs in <unk> , but this is a <unk> <unk> from <unk> , and <unk> in <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only thing that <unk> <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen . It &apos;s also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , the whole example , not images .
This is the <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
To <unk> that it &apos;s really <unk> and not images , we can do something like that , to actually see that it &apos;s a real <unk> <unk> , not a picture .
It could be a little bit <unk> to read a book <unk> .
I don &apos;t tell you about it .
This is an example of <unk> . This is a <unk> <unk> .
Every image of a <unk> is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the real <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is to nature a <unk> kind of <unk> .
We also made something with the corner of this particular number of <unk> .
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much higher than the one that you use in a normal <unk> , and we <unk> on the content .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
I think this <unk> <unk> to <unk> and other <unk> like that , not <unk> to be <unk> .
Of course , <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this one I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not say we have <unk> <unk> to give us to <unk> in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> a NASA <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So now , let &apos;s look at something else .
This is actually live on the web ; you can see it .
This is a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> student of Washington , with the help of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s live on the web , <unk> <unk> .
You can see when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of experience to <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of images here actually a meaning .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and these things have been <unk> all <unk> <unk> , and these things have been all <unk> at <unk> level .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some more environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> data <unk> and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that we &apos;ve done for the first time in the summer , to show you what <unk> is really the key behind this technology , this technology is really the key behind this technology , and it &apos;s not <unk> , and it &apos;s not <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> by looking at the <unk> that we &apos;ve done in the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> and so forth .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> pictures of types in <unk> , and <unk> and so forth . <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> a picture that &apos;s <unk> a picture that &apos;s <unk> <unk> a picture that &apos;s <unk> discovery .
So they &apos;re all <unk> pictures and <unk> have been all <unk> <unk> <unk> in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to <unk> this <unk> way .
You know , I would never thought of it .
It &apos;s very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think we &apos;ll see that it &apos;s a lot of different kinds of <unk> : that those cell phones to <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can do that , I can try and <unk> those <unk> .
Many are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
<unk> a number of here is a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from <unk> to <unk> physics .
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now <unk> data from the whole memory <unk> of how we <unk> the Earth , from the <unk> view of how we <unk> the Earth , from the <unk> view and <unk> all those data together .
All of those pictures become <unk> together , greater than the <unk> of the parts .
You have a model of the Earth &apos;s <unk> .
Think about this as a <unk> <unk> work on Earth <unk> .
It &apos;s something that <unk> in complexity , as people <unk> it , and the <unk> that we <unk> for the people who are <unk> it with the use .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people .
If somebody &apos;s a <unk> idea of <unk> , all of these <unk> <unk> , my picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I can use the <unk> as a <unk> <unk> in the space , in that <unk> , using the pictures of anyone else , and have an experience of social kind of <unk> and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all this is <unk> <unk> <unk> of every part interesting part of the Earth , not just by <unk> <unk> and <unk> images and <unk> pictures .
<unk> <unk> .
Chris Anderson : I understand good ? What &apos;s your software <unk> us to do is that at a certain point , in the next years , all the photographs that anybody in the entire world , are going to be <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is we &apos;re going to find out .
It &apos;s creating <unk> , if you want , in pictures .
And it &apos;s doing it on the content of images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about <unk> information <unk> that many of these <unk> images .
As you make a <unk> <unk> <unk> , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the web , and the text on the front page , and you have a <unk> of this picture .
Now , what happens if that picture <unk> all your pictures ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> that <unk> is really enormous . It &apos;s a <unk> effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it &apos;s really incredible . <unk> .
<unk> : I &apos;m going to tell you a lot .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is the way that you can live in the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> in the wind , the <unk> it in the wind <unk> , the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of plants .
<unk> to think that <unk> <unk> still beyond the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> , <unk> still <unk> the <unk> <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , and that the idea that the <unk> of <unk> , and that the idea that we live in the world that we live in which is not a reality , but it &apos;s just a reality of reality ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that our <unk> did , good , <unk> <unk> does .
And , of course , all of course , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> . <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We have to <unk> the <unk> of death , so we don &apos;t know if we <unk> and <unk> --
We all have an art .
What <unk> is the <unk> <unk> of the song , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> <unk> in the heart of <unk> .
And he was my <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , <unk> &apos;s mother &apos;s <unk> , on <unk> , the <unk> <unk> &apos;s mother &apos;s <unk> .
All of these <unk> are <unk> that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And , if you <unk> a second , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and <unk> that <unk> the planet , and it &apos;s important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> <unk> note .
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the total <unk> of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> ideas , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being from human imagination .
The <unk> is the <unk> <unk> of humanity .
It &apos;s the <unk> of what we can be is and what we can be <unk> species .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> very quickly .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the <unk> of <unk> just because it &apos;s <unk> , or -- in the <unk> <unk> -- in the field of diversity -- and you &apos;re not even <unk> <unk> -- that &apos;s <unk> diversity .
The <unk> of this is , of course , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
When you &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just a <unk> or a series of <unk> rules .
One language is the <unk> of human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle with which the <unk> of every culture comes in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we &apos;re here at <unk> , at least half not <unk> in the <unk> of children .
They &apos;re not <unk> to children , which means , unless you get something , which is not <unk> .
What is more <unk> than the <unk> <unk> , of being <unk> by <unk> , the last to talk about a language , of course , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> was the <unk> of someone in a few weeks , every two weeks of the world , every two weeks of a <unk> <unk> and <unk> with them in the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> language .
And I know anybody about it , &quot; <unk> &apos;t it ?
The world would not be a better place if we <unk> all the same language ? &quot; <unk> , then we &apos;re all <unk> . &quot;
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> of a <unk> thing that means that it doesn &apos;t speak its language .
I &apos;d like to show you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we &apos;re <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say &quot; different ways of <unk> , &quot; I mean , it &apos;s very different ways of <unk> .
For example this <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which <unk> to <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> that &apos;s not able to <unk> the blue color from green because the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> , because the <unk> is <unk> in the forest , which <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot;
All of this has <unk> in the <unk> past , but the <unk> is that in these <unk> families , where you &apos;re talking about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> nobody <unk> .
You can start listening and then I &apos;m going to talk to .
I had one of the most interesting <unk> with which I lived in , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that has had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
They made from the <unk> that <unk> them in <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> forest <unk> had never seen anything <unk> .
They <unk> the <unk> pictures , they <unk> the <unk> <unk> , they <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they didn &apos;t know anything , they <unk> that they <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk> .
But the <unk> are not only <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> to them .
<unk> percent <unk> had been <unk> by themselves .
We &apos;re <unk> at eight <unk> and found two cases of natural death and when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was so <unk> that he &apos;s dead <unk> , and then they <unk> it .
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> species .
<unk> years early &apos; <unk> , I was <unk> a really interesting task when my <unk> <unk> <unk> , if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
To give a sense of <unk> , I should have to understand culture <unk> and that <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s quite a <unk> view of the world .
Very interesting .
If you were to <unk> the great <unk> of the world , what do you <unk> ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that <unk> Africa doesn &apos;t have <unk> <unk> . And instead of <unk> is not the <unk> . And the <unk> is not the other than the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes interesting is the <unk> is the relationship of life and death .
So the <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by <unk> <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> live in such a way that for a short <unk> becomes the <unk> .
For this <unk> <unk> to say , &quot; <unk> <unk> go to <unk> to <unk> about God .
We &apos;re <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . &quot;
And since you &apos;re <unk> , is the spirit that <unk> you , how do you <unk> ?
So it &apos;s <unk> to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> in state of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather <unk> of power &apos;s mind on the body when it &apos;s <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m going to <unk> all the <unk> that I lived the most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> civilization <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> has never been <unk> by <unk> .
In <unk> today are <unk> by a <unk> , but their education is extraordinary <unk> .
<unk> are <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> and <unk> in a world made of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> of nine years of <unk> <unk> , the nine months of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of mother , now are <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
For this time , they &apos;re <unk> to <unk> , values that they <unk> that their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> .
Al term about this incredible <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> <unk> out and for the first time in their life , at 18 years , see a <unk> <unk> . And in that moment of <unk> <unk> <unk> , all the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , everything that they learned in <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and says ,
&quot; <unk> ? <unk> , I said . &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> . Now it &apos;s <unk> . Now it &apos;s <unk> .
They call the major <unk> and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re the <unk> of the world &apos;s <unk> .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think about <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> history of <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> in his <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the Earth .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by <unk> .
There is no space for these things in <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> , but <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and created a <unk> <unk> of Earth , not about the concept of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> : the concept that the Earth can only to be <unk> by human <unk> .
What does it mean ?
<unk> to say that a <unk> of <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> is a <unk> spirit that <unk> its <unk> is going to be <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s going to be <unk> different , and it &apos;s going to have a <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> that a mountain <unk> is a <unk> <unk> .
which is <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
And that made me a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> that are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If we were to <unk> that these <unk> can create different reality , we could start to understand some of their <unk> <unk> . They <unk> this <unk> .
I took this picture in <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you &apos;ve heard about <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
What makes it fascinating is not the potential <unk> of <unk> , but its <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> by two elements .
On one side , this <unk> <unk> <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> a little <unk> that <unk> a little bit of the <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> with a <unk> of a <unk> family <unk> said .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you &apos;re going to see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , the <unk> that make a different kind of <unk> , <unk> it has <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . &#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; makes &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; . It &apos;s not a <unk> of reality .
I often talk to my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the &apos; <unk> in the &apos; <unk> .
<unk> my <unk> can &apos;t tell you how to <unk> these <unk> , because if you &apos;re not <unk> , because if you &apos;re done , you can &apos;t tell anybody to be <unk> because they &apos;re <unk> by a <unk> that &apos;s <unk> , of course , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s possible to <unk> <unk> only if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now , it &apos;s the <unk> that are in this <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the same kind of <unk> to <unk> the <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> <unk> species , how do these <unk> <unk> two <unk> don &apos;t like that , but that if you <unk> in this way , create a <unk> <unk> that is <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> is <unk> ?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you go to the <unk> , we &apos;re going to take &quot; <unk> &quot; plants <unk> us . &quot;
What does it mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , who <unk> <unk> <unk> in the forest , and our eyes are going to be <unk> in the same species .
If you <unk> it as you <unk> their <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , you don &apos;t know everything ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take the <unk> <unk> in a <unk> of the moon and <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
And that &apos;s not <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , the problem is that even those of us who have to heart <unk> <unk> <unk> , but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of history than our real world &apos;s <unk> than our real world , and it <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk> , but rather like the <unk> in which we <unk> and <unk> <unk> , but rather like the <unk> where we have <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> diversity and <unk> the <unk> of <unk> diversity and <unk> <unk> <unk> . And the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> diversity and <unk> on the planet &apos;s <unk> .
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> don &apos;t have <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> <unk> and <unk> like <unk> did not have <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It &apos;s the power .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And if you look at a look at the world , you know , you know , they &apos;re not <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> and <unk> <unk> out of <unk> forces that go beyond their ability to <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that <unk> <unk> in the forest until a generation ago , and now <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that seems <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with <unk> discovery .
If we <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> , where I &apos;m doing many <unk> <unk> , you &apos;ll see the <unk> <unk> of politics .
As the <unk> , the <unk> physics of a <unk> , is <unk> <unk> , but <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , not only is not only <unk> , but <unk> <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it &apos;s part of <unk> development .
And you can &apos;t understand the <unk> <unk> until part of the <unk> .
I <unk> miles from <unk> in the <unk> , China through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> <unk> to <unk> what &apos;s behind . And I realized what the <unk> behind .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> during the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
which means that it was <unk> to be <unk> at the time of Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that led to the <unk> in <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk> .
It was taken by <unk> to <unk> at the age of two <unk> under his <unk> because he wouldn &apos;t have to live without him .
The <unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
One day he <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to work for seven years .
The <unk> of <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of <unk> is by <unk> .
At the end , everything <unk> to a choice .
<unk> to live in the world of <unk> or <unk> we want to <unk> the world of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died said that his greatest fear was said that , in our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> vision of the world , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination , not only <unk> the entire <unk> imagination of human imagination , and a <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it &apos;s <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , who gave us <unk> agriculture , who made us <unk> to the <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> , by creating the <unk> of <unk> , and we &apos;re talking about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world <unk> has to <unk> 300 years .
That <unk> history , I don &apos;t know that we have answers to all the challenges that we can <unk> in <unk> to come .
When these <unk> <unk> <unk> in the world , it &apos;s asked what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> different <unk> .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all <unk> the chance to be what we are , a <unk> species , which has to <unk> that all the <unk> and the <unk> can be <unk> . And there are big moments of <unk> .
I took this picture on the <unk> <unk> in <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> me , and this man , <unk> me , and he <unk> the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The government has not been <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the &apos; <unk> to <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
The family , <unk> for his life , <unk> away all the <unk> away , and all his <unk> .
You want to know that <unk> don &apos;t <unk> the cold , you &apos;ll see it .
The <unk> <unk> were made of fish <unk> fish in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn &apos;t <unk> <unk> from night or <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> away , it &apos;s <unk> the <unk> in the skin of <unk> and <unk> in their hand . When I did the <unk> , he <unk> them by <unk> by it by <unk> by it .
He &apos;s <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when he <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> created a <unk> , he <unk> another dog and <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to talk about <unk> ?
<unk> <unk> the government <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of an area of <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s their new <unk> . It &apos;s called <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> all the resources <unk> .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s quite <unk> to people who are in these <unk> areas of the planet , <unk> that we &apos;re not <unk> at all .
For somebody is home .
<unk> <unk> of human imagination that <unk> to <unk> in the <unk> . And for us all , the dreams of these children , as the dreams of our children , become part of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , we &apos;re <unk> <unk> that <unk> are <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to anything .
<unk> that <unk> --
<unk> are not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell stories about the world . Every month our site our site is <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our audience to places to <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> away from how they saw and , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> a <unk> world &apos;s <unk> in diversity , and we need to find a <unk> world &apos;s <unk> in a <unk> world , and we need to find a <unk> world in a <unk> world and <unk> <unk> .
where the <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope <unk> , and you &apos;ve heard about <unk> , in case , you &apos;re not going to <unk> them .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; The way to do it is to <unk> freedom . &quot;
The reason is , on one side , in fact that freedom is itself a value , is <unk> , useful , <unk> , <unk> for humans .
<unk> is what if we &apos;re <unk> , each of us can act for their own <unk> , without any one that <unk> our <unk> , without any one that <unk> our <unk> , without any one that <unk> in our name .
The way to <unk> freedom is <unk> .
More choices people have , more <unk> , and more <unk> , and more they are their <unk> .
This is , <unk> , it &apos;s so <unk> <unk> in society that nobody <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it &apos;s also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I &apos;ll show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I <unk> a simple note about <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that nobody is <unk> already that nobody of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s what <unk> is .
Then you go to the <unk> store for a <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , radio <unk> , radio , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there &apos;s a big number of <unk> <unk> .
We can make six and a half million different <unk> of <unk> using the <unk> that there are only one store .
<unk> <unk> there is <unk> choice .
<unk> <unk> : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the <unk> services , <unk> <unk> , <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , you &apos;re not <unk> it .
A <unk> of that , in the other , was that the phone never <unk> .
These days have gone .
We have now a <unk> <unk> <unk> , especially in cell phones .
Here are cell phones in the future .
My <unk> is that in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you haven &apos;t seen this yet in the <unk> , you &apos;re very <unk> that you &apos;re very soon .
And what happens to the end is that people <unk> in <unk> and <unk> this question . And you know what the answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a <unk> that doesn &apos;t make things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : It &apos;s not going to be in the United States that you &apos;re going to <unk> you what you have to do .
Instead , <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> says , &quot; OK , we can do that , or <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> and these <unk> , &quot; <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> has these <unk> and <unk> . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You were <unk> , &quot; <unk> , what do you do ? &quot;
And the <unk> says , &quot; At the <unk> , he has these <unk> and these <unk> and <unk> these <unk> and <unk> . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; <unk> if you were me , what would you say ? &quot;
And the <unk> , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
But actually , it &apos;s not a <unk> the weight and the responsibility to make it from somebody who knows something , <unk> the <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and it &apos;s not in the <unk> <unk> to make decisions .
There &apos;s a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me and you , who think if you think about it , it makes no sense , because we can &apos;t <unk> .
But if we can &apos;t <unk> , why do we <unk> them ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , so <unk> is a <unk> <unk> is a question of choice , how you <unk> in this <unk> . &quot; We don &apos;t want to <unk> the children . We want to <unk> the <unk> . &quot; We don &apos;t want to be <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
which means that every <unk> , at <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
<unk> to the family and the <unk> , a common perspective , almost for anybody , was that there was <unk> the <unk> as soon as possible .
The only one that was the who , not when , and not even what to do after .
<unk> , it &apos;s really to play .
I &apos;m going to be very smart students , and they <unk> their 20 percent less work than a time .
And it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less <unk> , not because they &apos;re <unk> .
but why I &apos;m <unk> , I &apos;m <unk> , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; <unk> <unk> or not ? <unk> do that ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> later ? I have to think before or career ? &quot;
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this <unk> doesn &apos;t <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and <unk> don &apos;t have a <unk> <unk> to my <unk> .
And they really have to do that . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the work is : we &apos;re <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because technology <unk> us to work every minute , from every corner of the planet , <unk> that from <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> , and I don &apos;t tell anybody what the <unk> works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What does that mean , this incredible freedom that we have about work ? It &apos;s that we have to decide , <unk> at any time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son to <unk> , with the cell phone in a <unk> , the <unk> in a <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And even though they &apos;re all <unk> , every minute we see our son <unk> , we &apos;re also <unk> , we &apos;re also <unk> , &quot; I have to answer this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to <unk> this <unk> ? I have to <unk> this letter ? I have to <unk> this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , &quot; all , that makes the experience of your child , very different from what would be in other conditions .
So , any part of any part of it , and big things , materials and <unk> , life is a question of choices .
And the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but not everything was a question of choice .
The world of today <unk> to this : <unk> is , &quot; Is it a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? &quot;
The answer is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the <unk> .
This <unk> two effects <unk> people .
The first one , <unk> , is that it <unk> instead of <unk> .
With a lot of <unk> that you choose , it &apos;s really difficult to do that .
I &apos;ll give you an example of <unk> : a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> different companies .
What she found was that she found that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> in more , the <unk> <unk> <unk> two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s 10 percent less than when they &apos;re available , and they &apos;re only five . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> between <unk> , and <unk> <unk> ,
And in <unk> , and again <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course <unk> never comes from .
It means that it doesn &apos;t just mean that these <unk> are <unk> food to <unk> because they &apos;re not going to have enough money , even to say that the decision is so <unk> that it also <unk> the <unk> <unk> of work .
They &apos;re not going to be <unk> until five <unk> <unk> <unk> for year from <unk> <unk> , which would be <unk> to <unk> .
So <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices .
And I think it &apos;s going to change the world like that .
&quot; And finally , to end the <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
You can actually make the right decision , if it &apos;s for <unk> , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and you &apos;re going to have the wrong <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can <unk> <unk> <unk> and make a choice , finally we <unk> <unk> with less <unk> from the result of how we were <unk> with less <unk> by <unk> .
And that &apos;s for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of <unk> between the <unk> , and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy , it &apos;s <unk> to imagine that <unk> could have been better . And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from decision , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> from decision ,
even when it was a <unk> decision .
More choices there are more <unk> than any <unk> that &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there is what <unk> call .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well <unk> how the value we value things that we give things to <unk> .
<unk> , you know , when there are so many <unk> you can , it &apos;s easy to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , and be less <unk> than <unk> .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m <unk> with all those who are not in New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably <unk> .
There &apos;s this <unk> to <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . It &apos;s all about the <unk> .
It &apos;s not <unk> . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; All my <unk> are away . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> right in front of home . &quot;
And it <unk> two weeks <unk> from the idea that it &apos;s <unk> -- every day -- the chance to <unk> it wants .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the more of the <unk> we have <unk> , the more the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It &apos;s about to live the moment , and maybe it &apos;s <unk> to live slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> to do not the other .
The things that they don &apos;t know many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> point : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried this on my skin <unk> a couple of <unk> .
It &apos;s almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were just one kind of <unk> , <unk> them and <unk> <unk> , and they were <unk> , only after <unk> a <unk> life and <unk> a lot of times , and we <unk> a lot of times , and we &apos;d go well .
So , I started to <unk> a couple of the <unk> , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> said , &quot; <unk> wants to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
<unk> them wants to <unk> or with <unk> ? &quot; <unk> &quot; or &quot; <unk> &quot; ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> -- &quot; <unk> <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a little bit of a <unk> I did , &quot; I want the guy who had never thought about what was , so that it was the only kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then I <unk> out of the store , <unk> , and then I <unk> out of the store , <unk> , and the best <unk> I had ever <unk> .
It was <unk> . With that choice , I had to <unk> the best .
But I &apos;m going to look at me .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice , my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
At the beginning I had <unk> <unk> . I didn &apos;t know anything about it , when I was just one guy , but when we <unk> 100 , at least a <unk> had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After I <unk> that I was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in life of people don &apos;t do that <unk> the <unk> that these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And this is less <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of <unk> , it makes it .
Because if you <unk> , I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth will be <unk> to this .
&quot; You were better when you were worse , &quot; The reason he was doing better when he was worse , he was even worse than <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are at the <unk> of <unk> .
You never get <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> are <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; Yes , you want to do it . &quot;
I mean -- little <unk> moment -- that I &apos;m really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have <unk> .
But <unk> isn &apos;t always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> a couple of <unk> <unk> when there is only that kind of <unk> is that when you &apos;re not <unk> , and you &apos;re <unk> , &quot; Why ? &quot;
Who is <unk> ? &quot; The answer is <unk> .
The world is <unk> . What can I do ?
When there are hundreds of <unk> , and you <unk> a <unk> , and you know , who &apos;s the <unk> , is clear that the <unk> you are .
<unk> could do better .
With hundreds of <unk> <unk> , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even if the result is <unk> , they <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to them .
In the last few years , the <unk> is <unk> in the world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- of this <unk> <unk> is really <unk> that people have experiences because the standard are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation think that <unk> is .
So the end result is that in general , we &apos;re better , <unk> , but we &apos;re going to have worse .
I &apos;m going to tell you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all do for good and it &apos;s completely <unk> . It &apos;s not true .
There is no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk> at all , but that &apos;s not <unk> that a lot of choice is better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a <unk> value , <unk> . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve <unk> from a piece of the level that the choices that the <unk> choices to our lives .
Now , from a <unk> <unk> -- I almost finished -- from the <unk> point of view , <unk> is the <unk> .
What you can do this choice in <unk> society is <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you &apos;re <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that they have <unk> .
The problem is that they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I &apos;m talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what he does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> has talked about yesterday about how those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> of money .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , not that they &apos;re just <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
They do have worse .
If a little bit of what we do in our society , it <unk> to be <unk> in those where people are too much <unk> , it would not only be their lives to <unk> but also our own .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
To finish , &quot; <unk> , you can become everything you want , &quot;
<unk> , people in culture , <unk> , &quot; What <unk> that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s <unk> that you can &apos;t do anything in a glass of glass . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> view of the world --
And I <unk> it , I <unk> it like this , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , I realized , I realized that fish know that fish is very long .
Because the reality of fact is that if you <unk> it in <unk> the <unk> , so that &quot; everything is possible . &quot; You don &apos;t <unk> freedom . &quot;
If you <unk> the <unk> so that it can <unk> it all possible to <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They all need a <unk> .
This is almost certainly almost certainly <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
