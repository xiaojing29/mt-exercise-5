<unk> year I showed these <unk> for <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years , had the size of the United States , it &apos;s <unk> percent .
I &apos;m going to <unk> this <unk> of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is , in a way , the heart <unk> of climate system .
They <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
The next <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You see , you can see , it <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That &apos;s the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , five or more , is like the blood , that &apos;s where it &apos;s from the body .
In 25 years , it was done , so .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> around the <unk> of the <unk> , where there are huge <unk> that , <unk> , are <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , that amount of <unk> , that amount of <unk> , that amount of <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> is already <unk> by water .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a team <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : She &apos;s good . The question is if you do it .
One is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the North <unk> .
This is a river in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> never had that <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how the <unk> <unk> <unk> the sea level of <unk> on <unk> , here is where the sea is <unk> .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
On the other hand on the planet : <unk> , the biggest <unk> of the planet .
<unk> month , scientists have <unk> that the ice <unk> is in <unk> , and that the Western <unk> , which is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> at six feet of the <unk> of the <unk> , like in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the third largest <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which few years ago , were <unk> .
40 percent of the world population <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : This is the source of <unk> water <unk> of this city .
The <unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same happens to water .
In California , <unk> <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> percent .
The <unk> <unk> are in crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they &apos;re <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> in the world leads to a <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and without <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years , <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the whole <unk> .
If you look at it in the context of you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve <unk> million <unk> of CO2 every day .
Look at <unk> the area of the <unk> <unk> , to <unk> , and on both the parts of the <unk> <unk> , where there is a <unk> oxygen <unk> in the oceans .
The biggest cause of global warming , together to <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
The oil is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of two countries with more emissions , with China .
And they <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> .
But we &apos;re <unk> to a <unk> .
These are the projects that are <unk> in the last few years and some <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In fact , there is a political <unk> in our country .
The <unk> of <unk> and oil <unk> have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I <unk> image of something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it on the <unk> .
This is the second largest flow in America .
It &apos;s happened around <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> the <unk> is a <unk> and happy .
It &apos;s <unk> here in America , and it <unk> our economy .
<unk> the <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Al <unk> : From here , it &apos;s a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The biggest society <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> . <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- not know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al <unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , one part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> , we see the <unk> changes like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And so , we have a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> the truth .
Actually , the <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it &apos;s <unk> -- it &apos;s got a good <unk> .
So , it doesn &apos;t change climate change .
We could do that .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> -- you &apos;ve heard of it .
So , you <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> machines are a little <unk> , but this is the sound of <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> is between the main <unk> of global warming , but the <unk> technology that you see all the <unk> that you see all the way .
Let &apos;s look at this : this is the <unk> technology of <unk> .
Al <unk> : <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security .
<unk> : <unk> America is in crisis ; the economy , the national security , the national security crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all of <unk> : our <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and oil <unk> .
Now , though , is a new solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan for <unk> America to work , <unk> more <unk> , and help <unk> the global <unk> .
<unk> , one solution that we can solve our problems .
<unk> America .
Al <unk> : This is the last .
<unk> : <unk> : It &apos;s about energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> the <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , sun , a new network .
<unk> <unk> 2 : <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> America . It &apos;s time to be <unk> .
Al <unk> : A <unk> <unk> says , &quot; If you want to go on , you go on the only one .
If you want to go far , you go . &quot;
We need to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED , I made a <unk> on <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to try to <unk> how the machine works .
So here it is . And for those that the other time there were , the <unk> is the biggest experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were in less than a <unk> of the second beginning from the beginning of the universe -- to <unk> million times a second .
This is simply <unk> .
This is the <unk> machine .
<unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk> .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> feet , and it &apos;s a <unk> feet .
This is a <unk> image of <unk> in building . And you can see the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> last year , we <unk> the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> of particles that had done all the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles inside the <unk> .
In other words , when you <unk> that image , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> that the camera , which is a great <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if that was that to do us , when somebody <unk> on Google and they <unk> that the <unk> page was this .
That means that we have had a <unk> impact over to that scientific .
And so , a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to just these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine works at the <unk> of <unk> .
Now , the <unk> of you <unk> <unk> and <unk> , &quot; It &apos;s not true . I &apos;m <unk> . &quot;
And instead they can do it because when they &apos;re very <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees , at least <unk> degrees <unk> to that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> between the <unk> <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think that these are <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and that &apos;s <unk> about 30 <unk> .
They are about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
Now they &apos;re now <unk> everybody in their <unk> .
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> is going to be new <unk> .
I <unk> it , and we <unk> to get data to <unk> or <unk> , and continue so our <unk> to find out what the <unk> is going to find out what the universe is .
Now , of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering <unk> . It &apos;s easy to <unk> .
I think that &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s so hard , I think it &apos;s the value of things like <unk> .
I want to end with the words of one <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> experiments of his <unk> , his <unk> was , &quot; said , &quot; No , it &apos;s so <unk> to the human mind , that there are no <unk> in nature , that there are no <unk> in nature , that we don &apos;t have in nature , and that we don &apos;t have new <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> with <unk> , when , from children , <unk> with <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , actually to think and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way most of the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with objects , with my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started to say , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having the <unk> of <unk> as a digital <unk> that moves on a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> information with both hands on a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> a information with both hands .
and we <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that I <unk> to explore the answer , building <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer .
You can <unk> them with your hand , they can <unk> their <unk> , and they have a screen and they have a screen and they have a radio <unk> .
But <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> objects , you can just <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools for <unk> the digital information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement , <unk> of their movement , and as they become more <unk> , <unk> of its movement , and the other people , of how we <unk> them , we can explore new <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ll start with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you of the video of the <unk> . If you <unk> it in one direction , the <unk> video , if you go on the other side back .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , you <unk> to what they are .
If they &apos;re <unk> , they can <unk> it and they can <unk> it a little bit .
If they &apos;re <unk> , they can <unk> it and they can <unk> it a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We realized that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> was the <unk> that you can use common on the data , for example , like , <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> it for the color of the color in that central .
And I can <unk> it to <unk> color in that central color , where you <unk> .
And we can <unk> it a little bit of a place .
There are also <unk> possibilities of <unk> , like <unk> , <unk> and <unk> games where people can try and <unk> things that are going to try and <unk> the results immediately .
Now I &apos;m going to ...
This is a sequence of <unk> that I do with a <unk> program .
So , here we have a game here , which is half between <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> , a letter to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , every <unk> <unk> a letter to <unk> , <unk> a letter to <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try to do .
Thank you .
There &apos;s a <unk> children in <unk> <unk> , I did that I <unk> them and I <unk> them and <unk> a video .
They &apos;re very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of <unk> is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just wanted to say , &quot; <unk> of words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
There &apos;s a other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , there on the right .
It actually just wanted to <unk> it .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
I want to build a <unk> <unk> . He &apos;s <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So , it &apos;s going to get out of the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now , he took a <unk> .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : Yeah ! Yeah .
So , you <unk> <unk> and <unk> can make the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time to show you is a <unk> , that I recently made , to <unk> and <unk> music .
It &apos;s a <unk> , that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , <unk> music .
The <unk> here is <unk> by <unk> like <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> of these has four different <unk> , and you can choose which you use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of <unk> to your <unk> .
And they just <unk> by doing a <unk> , &quot; sound &quot; and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually effects that you can control live , like the <unk> and <unk> .
I <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> it .
And then there are the <unk> effects of time and <unk> , which is <unk> to the whole sequence .
<unk> how it works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> , <unk> a <unk> sequence , the <unk> in a series , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the other <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m going to take a <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : Now let &apos;s <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> : And now I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> to the <unk> , so I can control the effect from alive .
<unk> : I can <unk> the whole sequence of time on one side or the other .
<unk> : <unk> : And now I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> to give the bottom to give the <unk> .
<unk> : I can <unk> the &quot; <unk> &quot; flight . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to tell you , but I can <unk> it , you &apos;ll be <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the whole sequence on the left the <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new <unk> <unk> <unk> more and more <unk> to how our brain works and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this path , and some possibilities we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to <unk> is that it &apos;s going to <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> , which <unk> in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time I &apos;m going to talk to you all .
I &apos;m a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and my <unk> .
And it doesn &apos;t look like that .
But , this is something that happened in my life and in my life , and in my life , which led me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I <unk> wrote this book , this <unk> called &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which , <unk> , &quot; which , <unk> from my <unk> books , for some reason for some reason for <unk> <unk> in the world and <unk> a big , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere I <unk> , people like I was <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> !
I &apos;m going to all <unk> and say , &quot; Don &apos;t you fear of you can &apos;t be <unk> to do better ?
You don &apos;t have fear of <unk> all life that you can be able to do a book that can help someone ? &quot;
What can you do you do somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , except I remember that I remember that over 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to <unk> to the same <unk> <unk> .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you know , you don &apos;t know that they have success ?
<unk> &apos;t you that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> &apos;t you have to do this <unk> for all life without anything that you &apos;ve ever come out and die on a <unk> of dreams with the mouth of <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yeah , I <unk> all of those things .
I &apos;ve always been <unk> .
And I &apos;ve also <unk> of other things that people couldn &apos;t <unk> it .
As the <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , what I think about the writing is what I thought and <unk> <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It &apos;s <unk> that anyone who <unk> to be <unk> by being <unk> by doing .
But what is this particular <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not ?
How did my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I don &apos;t remember one time in his 40 years of the activity that the <unk> was asked if he was afraid to be <unk> ?
It never -- that <unk> of the <unk> John , like that ?
Don &apos;t you do that , you know ?
<unk> , the engineers <unk> like a group of not have , in <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
We have enough , we have this <unk> , and not only <unk> but <unk> of all sorts of things , we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
And so , not even though he &apos;s looking at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often <unk> them .
And the ones that don &apos;t seem to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before he died , in the last <unk> said , &quot; Every my book <unk> <unk> me a little more <unk> about the work of their life .
But we didn &apos;t know when we say that because we &apos;ve heard these things so long , we &apos;ve got <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and the art , at the end of the <unk> , <unk> always <unk> .
And the question I want to tell you to all here today is : you agree with this idea ?
I &apos;m going to do you well , because it &apos;s going to be <unk> by a <unk> away from a <unk> distance to me .
I think it &apos;s <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s also <unk> , and I don &apos;t want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better <unk> our <unk> to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> <unk> to that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> that I &apos;m in my career .
<unk> -- <unk> look at it , I &apos;m a young <unk> , I &apos;ve been about 40 years .
I &apos;ve got about four <unk> of work in me .
And it &apos;s very <unk> that anything that <unk> of what &apos;s going to happen in the world as the work that <unk> after the last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- is <unk> that my biggest success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> thinking .
You know , this is the kind of thought that leads to <unk> people to start <unk> <unk> at nine <unk> <unk> at nine <unk> and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I love to keep this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so I think , after many <unk> , that the way of working to keep writing is that you can do a <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to have a <unk> distance of <unk> between me , which I &apos;m <unk> , and my natural <unk> that you have to get . And as I &apos;m going to <unk> for all last year , how to do we <unk> to look through time , looking through the ideas to see if you have some of the best ideas .
as to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research led me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s because it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don &apos;t believe that creativity is <unk> by men , OK ?
It <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for reasons <unk> and <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from far away .
The <unk> were the same idea , but they <unk> that kind of spirit without a <unk> .
which is <unk> , because the <unk> didn &apos;t really think that a <unk> was particularly smart .
And I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> literally <unk> in the <unk> of the study of a artist , a little bit like the <unk> <unk> , and it <unk> out to <unk> the work of that .
<unk> <unk> , that &apos;s the distance I talk about -- that <unk> <unk> you <unk> from your <unk> <unk> of your work .
And everybody <unk> that was so you would have to do , right ?
So the <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like the too <unk> , right ?
If you have to <unk> you didn &apos;t have to <unk> the whole <unk> , you all <unk> that you have been <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If you have your work , you didn &apos;t have your whole , right ?
<unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> creativity <unk> in <unk> for a long time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and everything <unk> , and we <unk> this great idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe , and the <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people started to think that creativity is completely from the <unk> .
And for the first time in history , it <unk> to <unk> it to <unk> this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> , a person with the <unk> .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think you &apos;re going to be like a <unk> person , a simple person to believe that it &apos;s a <unk> like the source , the <unk> and the <unk> of all <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> the <unk> and creates all of these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s been this pressure to have <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years .
And if that &apos;s true , and I think , that &apos;s the question becomes , and I think ?
Can we do that ?
They want to go back to a <unk> understanding of human relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t <unk> 500 years of thinking about thinking about in a <unk> <unk> .
And there is probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , you do that people <unk> <unk> on their projects .
<unk> don &apos;t all <unk> you all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to <unk> is -- why not ?
Why not we do this way ?
Because it has more sense of everything that I &apos;ve ever heard about to explain the <unk> <unk> .
A process that , as anyone who ever ever have <unk> to do something -- so , all of us here -- you know , you don &apos;t have <unk> <unk> .
And , in fact , it can look like <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , who has now 90 years , but that was a <unk> for all of life and said that during his <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , inside the <unk> , and I <unk> it , inside the <unk> .
He said it was like a <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> <unk> to her from the <unk> .
I <unk> it to get it , because it <unk> the land under his feet .
I decided to have one thing to do to do that point and it was , words , &quot; <unk> as a <unk> . &quot;
And so he came home and he came up with this <unk> , and he didn &apos;t have anything else to take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> , and he <unk> on the page .
<unk> times , I didn &apos;t think it &apos;s fast , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> the <unk> through and she would <unk> her and she would <unk> <unk> through the <unk> , looking , and she would be <unk> through the <unk> , and she would <unk> it to <unk> it . &quot;
Then there were the time , this piece of never <unk> -- there were moments of moments when the was almost <unk> , OK ?
So , he was <unk> at home and he was looking at the <unk> through , and he <unk> the <unk> through , and he <unk> a <unk> just in the while he was <unk> with the other hand and the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> , and the <unk> in his body and <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the page <unk> and <unk> , but the <unk> , from the last word to the first one .
So when I <unk> <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not all my <unk> process -- I &apos;m not a <unk> .
I &apos;m a <unk> , and my way to <unk> is ; I <unk> it every day and <unk> and work and <unk> and <unk> and work and <unk> on it .
But even I , in my <unk> , I <unk> it against that thing , sometimes .
And I &apos;m going to be that many of you have that .
You know , even if I work and ideas <unk> me from a certain source , I couldn &apos;t <unk> it .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it in it way we don &apos;t do our head , but rather , that we make us <unk> ?
And so , I think , the best example , which I have <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;ve <unk> several years ago for a <unk> .
<unk> of this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , trying to control , <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , he was <unk> , and he was <unk> on a day , he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , <unk> it all for him .
<unk> <unk> , and all of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> , who comes in his head like <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the <unk> , but not knows how to <unk> .
It didn &apos;t have a piece of paper , it has no <unk> .
So it starts to hear this kind of old <unk> <unk> in him , &quot; I &apos;m going to <unk> it from this <unk> song .
I &apos;m not <unk> enough , and I can &apos;t <unk> . &quot;
And instead of going to go to the <unk> , it <unk> .
<unk> the whole process and made something completely new .
He just just just the sky and said , &quot; <unk> , you can &apos;t see that I &apos;m <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Do you think it can write a song ?
If you really want to <unk> , I &apos;m going to take care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> more .
<unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And his process <unk> <unk> <unk> after that .
Not the work , it was still <unk> as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> out of him <unk> , which was <unk> to the <unk> back from where he was , he didn &apos;t have to be something <unk> and <unk> .
but I <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing that <unk> and <unk> that was not <unk> .
So , how much that story <unk> to change a little bit , even the way I <unk> and I already <unk> once .
This idea , I was <unk> when I was <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; and I <unk> it into one of those <unk> of the <unk> that we <unk> all when we &apos;re working on something , and we can &apos;t think it will be a <unk> , which will be the book , which will be the <unk> .
Not only <unk> , just the book wrote .
And we started thinking of <unk> this project .
But then I &apos;m going to <unk> that <unk> to the air and <unk> us .
So I <unk> my face on <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I said <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , what , we know that if this book is not going to be <unk> <unk> , my , right ?
Because you see I &apos;m going to <unk> you see what I have , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do that , you don &apos;t have anything .
I started writing the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to please be <unk> that I &apos;m <unk> to do my part . &quot; Because , it &apos;s like , OK , <unk> -- it &apos;s the <unk> of Africa , people <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every <unk> , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> .
And I know you what I do , because I know you &apos;ve all seen , at some point , a <unk> like that .
It was like time if the time it <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it didn &apos;t do anything different from the <unk> , like the <unk> <unk> <unk> before , but all the <unk> .
And all of a sudden , not just as a human one .
But it <unk> up from <unk> and <unk> on the fire of <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , they <unk> it with his name .
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> by &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; which you can still feel in <unk> or <unk> .
In <unk> , when a artist did something impossible and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- one of God .
And it &apos;s <unk> because we need it .
But the problem comes the day , the problem comes the same , when you <unk> and <unk> that are the 11 of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s simply a <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , and maybe you never get more to <unk> <unk> to that <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God again as <unk> , and what is to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so <unk> if you can &apos;t believe , <unk> , <unk> , the most <unk> <unk> of your being being from you .
But let &apos;s just show you that data in <unk> from a <unk> source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk> when you &apos;re finished .
And , you know , if you think that &apos;s going to change it .
And so I started <unk> , and it &apos;s certainly how I <unk> it for several months during the <unk> <unk> , which was soon <unk> , <unk> of my <unk> <unk> .
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel like this is , not fear .
Don &apos;t just do it . You just have your work .
<unk> to <unk> your <unk> , whatever it can be .
If you have your work is <unk> , you know .
If the <unk> , you &apos;re going to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for one moment through your <unk> , then , &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
<unk> , you do the same <unk> .
And &quot; <unk> ! &quot; to you do that .
I think , and I think it &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; to you do it , even for <unk> had human love and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can <unk> and discovery of new genes .
Now we &apos;re <unk> a new <unk> : we &apos;ve started to <unk> biology and now start by that digital code , we &apos;re <unk> in a new <unk> <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We &apos;ve always tried to <unk> big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; is something that many <unk> I think have <unk> to understand how many <unk> I think they have to <unk> <unk> .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> for almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to move from the <unk> world of the computer biology in the digital world .
Now , we can <unk> life , or create new life on this digital universe ?
This is a map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the most small genome that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> a little even smaller .
We can <unk> a <unk> of <unk> that are here .
But when we look at his <unk> map , it &apos;s simple than our own .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at a time , it &apos;s very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> .
So , I thought that the only way to <unk> this <unk> <unk> in a way that they <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of &quot; Can we <unk> a <unk> ? &quot;
Can the chemistry <unk> of making these big molecules that we never have done before ?
And , in case , can we make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is simply a piece of <unk> <unk> material .
The speed with which we are able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> <unk> the <unk> code , instead , <unk> slowly , but it &apos;s <unk> .
And our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before the experiments .
But we found that <unk> of DNA is very difficult .
There are thousands of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA , the <unk> of 30 to 50 <unk> and it &apos;s a <unk> process . The more <unk> is , the more <unk> than there .
So we had to develop a new <unk> for <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , from information , from digital information that &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a little <unk> that you can see bacteria .
We designed <unk> , we <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA <unk> , and we <unk> a DNA of about <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> it in the bacteria , the bacteria have <unk> this <unk> and <unk> the <unk> particles .
The <unk> particles have been <unk> by cells , they <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I talked about recently with <unk> members of the <unk> industry that they have certainly <unk> this model .
They have more than you .
I think this is a situation where software can actually build its own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But I could do the bigger things .
I had to build the entire <unk> of <unk> .
They are more than <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> code .
So we thought of <unk> in the size of the virus of the virus , so that we can change the <unk> of a <unk> .
<unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> information with the computer , they have to be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> .
We found out , 30 <unk> . If you could use that original sequence never be able to do it .
A part of the process is design <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of the <unk> to build smaller <unk> that <unk> together .
<unk> elements here .
You probably have read that you have read us .
So , we have a <unk> code that <unk> on four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , and there &apos;s a <unk> order of <unk> for every <unk> .
So we can use the <unk> code for writing , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did we do at the beginning , it was <unk> .
Some of them have been <unk> by the fact that it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> <unk> by simply <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> <unk> .
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> with <unk> from five to seven <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to them to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
At every step , we made these <unk> <unk> in <unk> , so that we &apos;re going to create a very <unk> <unk> , as you see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to <unk> the process .
So , this looks like a <unk> of <unk> .
When we go to these <unk> <unk> much , more than 100 <unk> <unk> , no longer <unk> directly into the <unk> <unk> .
It comes to the <unk> of the <unk> of biology .
So we &apos;ve <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> <unk> to <unk> the DNA that we can <unk> the <unk> .
Here &apos;s an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , it can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> 12 hours it &apos;s <unk> exactly like it was before .
<unk> of thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can completely <unk> .
You have to live under <unk> .
I &apos;m sure that life <unk> in space , and they <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
Actually , NASA showed that this is what this is happening .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we &apos;ve built these <unk> , just using the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is not been <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we &apos;ve done a little time ago .
They are more than <unk> <unk> of <unk> code .
It &apos;s the biggest <unk> of a <unk> structure ever <unk> by human .
It has a <unk> <unk> <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 without spaces , you will just <unk> pages to <unk> this <unk> code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we <unk> ?
Of course , <unk> , a virus is a <unk> .
It &apos;s a little more <unk> when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s <unk> cells , even when it &apos;s <unk> cells like our : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the process of <unk> .
In the <unk> , the <unk> is actually <unk> in the cell , but we have <unk> that we are able to do a <unk> <unk> from one cell to another and of <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> by a <unk> species .
The two different are the same men .
We <unk> some <unk> <unk> more <unk> in a way that you could decide what you &apos;ve got to choose to this <unk> .
He <unk> it with the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell , it <unk> the <unk> , and we <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> .
And we <unk> <unk> that we didn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried it still <unk> it more .
This is one of the biggest <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere , and <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So who thinks about evolution as one <unk> at a time that <unk> doesn &apos;t have much of biology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell didn &apos;t <unk> one .
The <unk> <unk> we <unk> it .
It &apos;s <unk> , and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material , it <unk> , and we <unk> it with only the cell .
It &apos;s got blue blue because of the genes we have <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species went to <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> of all in a new species , <unk> on the software that we <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code that <unk> will be exactly to what we &apos;ve <unk> you .
Now , this might seem <unk> <unk> , but we can <unk> the software , we can change things in the way .
Now , I &apos;ve already <unk> that you &apos;re not talking about <unk> -- but of progress from three million years and a half million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> that we <unk> new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> when we think of our <unk> .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion people to <unk> billion over the next 40 years .
Just to give one example : I was born in <unk> .
Now , there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> ; in the <unk> , 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re going to <unk> now to find food , water <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> for six billion people .
We &apos;re going to be even <unk> to do it for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , over 30 billion <unk> .
That means percent of <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process to <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
In more we need to realize that all the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
And at the day , because of the <unk> <unk> in all over the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that &apos;s <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> <unk> only one <unk> about <unk> , and you think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from reality and our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , because of these <unk> <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call the <unk> <unk> .
We can build a big robot that can make a million <unk> a day .
Think of these 20 million genes or <unk> , and try to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to make <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard <unk> .
We can choose for <unk> , chemistry or chemistry , <unk> production , <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software that we &apos;re working on to be able to <unk> and design and design on the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how to be .
We know exactly what their <unk> code .
Now we &apos;re <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> .
You &apos;ve seen that you &apos;re going to be <unk> by the <unk> .
We <unk> on the third generation , which is <unk> enough , from the <unk> to <unk> more than the <unk> or <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would <unk> <unk> the CO2 in the <unk> , and we &apos;re working on design , and we think we can reach that we have the first <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> solar <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> of the <unk> , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> we <unk> in <unk> .
It <unk> in the deep ocean , at about <unk> feet <unk> to the temperature of water .
<unk> <unk> by using hydrogen <unk> as energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can <unk> the CO2 , which can easily be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , we think we might be able to <unk> what we might be able to <unk> what the basic question , &quot; is , we , we have the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole <unk> industry .
<unk> . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t ?
It <unk> a <unk> source of energy .
And , we &apos;re working on for using the same <unk> to use <unk> <unk> .
You &apos;ve seen this year with flu , we always go back a year and with a dollar less when it &apos;s about finding the right <unk> .
I think that you can change building <unk> in <unk> .
This is how the future might start looking at <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> the evolution with <unk> , <unk> , and finally cells .
We &apos;re so <unk> to <unk> people .
Our purpose is to do in a way of living in order to try to <unk> it . Thank you very much .
First of all , I &apos;m going to show you , the <unk> possible , some <unk> , the new technology that we took to <unk> <unk> to a <unk> that <unk> to a <unk> almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
It &apos;s a environment where you can <unk> is at local level that <unk> with a huge amount of data <unk> .
We &apos;re seeing here , we &apos;re seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> the images like we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much the amount of information that we see , how much of the data is that we see , how much of the data is that we see , how much of the amount of information that we see , how much of the amount of information that we see , how much of the amount of information that we see , how much of information it is the amount of information that we see , how much of information is that we see , how much of
Most of the <unk> photographs , but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen . It &apos;s also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a book whole , of data .
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> is a <unk> .
And so , it &apos;s the <unk> that it &apos;s not about images , we can do something like that , to really see that it &apos;s a real <unk> , not a picture .
It could be a little bit of a way to read a <unk> book .
I don &apos;t <unk> it .
This is a <unk> example . This is a <unk> number .
Every image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And I really gives you the good pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the real version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature , which is for nature .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of The <unk> .
We created a <unk> <unk> that you can use in a <unk> <unk> that you use in a normal <unk> , and we <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or even the <unk> <unk> .
And that really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
I &apos;m going to have that <unk> to put in <unk> and other <unk> <unk> , not <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this one , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say we have <unk> <unk> to give us , and we have <unk> .
These are all the <unk> in the United States <unk> over a NASA <unk> .
So now I &apos;m going to try to do that .
This is actually live on the Web ; you can <unk> see .
This is a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> , and the other is a <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> <unk> , a student of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s live on the Web , <unk> by <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can move from one image to the other and have this kind of experience to <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here actually has meaning .
The <unk> <unk> of the computer <unk> , they <unk> these images together , so that they <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk> . So here you see some elements of a <unk> <unk> , and you see some elements of a <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> at the <unk> level .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of <unk> data , and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> that we &apos;ve done for the first time , the summer , to show you what <unk> is really the key behind this technology , the <unk> technology . And it &apos;s not so <unk> <unk> by looking at the <unk> that we have in the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> <unk> and so on .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> . <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> a picture that you have , a picture that you have discovered to this model .
So they &apos;re all <unk> <unk> and have been all <unk> at the <unk> level in this way .
And it is possible to <unk> this way .
You know , I would never have thought of working on <unk> .
It &apos;s very <unk> <unk> .
I think we can see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of <unk> : from those cell phones to <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> , <unk> <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I can try and <unk> those <unk> .
A lot of them are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
<unk> a <unk> here is a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from <unk> to the physics of this environment .
The <unk> is that we can do things with social environment . This is now <unk> data from the whole memory of how the Earth the <unk> of how the Earth the <unk> , from the whole <unk> of <unk> and <unk> all that data together .
All of those pictures become <unk> together , the greater than the <unk> of the parts .
You have a model of the whole thing that <unk> .
Think of this as a <unk> <unk> &apos;s work on Earth .
It &apos;s something that <unk> in complexity , as people <unk> it , and the <unk> that <unk> for the <unk> with the use of .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people .
If somebody comes the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name , my <unk> <unk> <unk> , my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of those data , and I can use it as a point of <unk> to <unk> in that space , in that <unk> , using the <unk> of anyone else , and to have a <unk> <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of this is extremely <unk> <unk> <unk> of every part interesting part of the Earth , <unk> not only by <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understood what ? What &apos;s the software will help us do is that at some point , in the next few years , all the pictures <unk> from anybody in the entire world , <unk> will be <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is that it &apos;s going to find out .
It &apos;s creating <unk> , if you want , you want , in <unk> .
And it &apos;s doing it in the <unk> of the <unk> .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> of information that a lot of these <unk> .
As you do a research of images on the Web , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the Web page , it has a lot of information about the images .
Now , what happens if that picture is <unk> to all your pictures ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really enormous . It &apos;s a <unk> effect .
CA : <unk> , it &apos;s really incredible .
<unk> : I &apos;m going to <unk> you very much .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is the <unk> to live between who , who has no <unk> <unk> <unk> , between who has no <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the plants .
You think that <unk> <unk> <unk> still beyond the <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , or that <unk> , the <unk> still <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , and that the idea that we live in there is not in a sense , but it &apos;s just a model of reality ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> did , well , a lot of <unk> .
And , of course , all <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> . <unk> .
We are <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We need to <unk> the death <unk> , so we don &apos;t <unk> if you <unk> and <unk> --
We all have an art .
What <unk> is the particular <unk> of the song , the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of <unk> .
He was my <unk> <unk> of journey in the <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , the <unk> &apos;s mother &apos;s <unk> .
All of these <unk> <unk> us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other way of moving in the world .
And if you <unk> a second , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of <unk> of the world create a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and it &apos;s important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> , and you can <unk> the <unk> of all <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being by being human imagination .
The <unk> is the <unk> <unk> of humanity .
It &apos;s the <unk> of what we can be as much as <unk> species .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all species have been or on the <unk> of <unk> , because it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s just because it &apos;s <unk> , or -- in the <unk> of the <unk> diversity -- and you don &apos;t even know about <unk> <unk> -- that diversity .
The <unk> of that is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just a language <unk> by a <unk> or a series of <unk> rules .
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle with the one that <unk> of every culture comes in the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a <unk> , a thought , a <unk> of <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we &apos;re sitting here at <unk> , at least half not <unk> in the <unk> of children .
They &apos;re not <unk> to children , the one that means , the less than anything , which is already <unk> .
What is more <unk> than being <unk> by <unk> , of being the last few to talk about a language , of not having a <unk> <unk> <unk> or to <unk> the <unk> of the children ?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of somebody in a few weeks , every two weeks , every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I know that somebody of you say , &quot; Don &apos;t do that ?
The world would not be a better place if you <unk> all the same language ? &quot; <unk> , then we talk all the time .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> of a <unk> thing that means , we can talk about their language .
I &apos;d like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we &apos;re going to be <unk> .
A lot of us <unk> that when I say , &quot; different ways of <unk> <unk> . &quot; I mean different ways of <unk> .
So , for example , this <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which <unk> the <unk> <unk> from the river of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> that it doesn &apos;t be able to <unk> the blue color from green because the time <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> of the forest , which <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; : you have to <unk> a person talking about a language .
And all of this has <unk> in the past <unk> , the <unk> is that in these <unk> families , which are about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> nobody <unk> .
They <unk> to hear and then <unk> to speak .
I <unk> one of the most interesting <unk> with which I lived , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in the <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> contact with a <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;ve done by the top of the photographs that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> <unk> had never seen anything .
They <unk> the <unk> <unk> , they <unk> the research of one form or a <unk> and , they didn &apos;t know anything , they <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with the <unk> .
But the <unk> is not only <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> to each other .
<unk> percent of <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We went to eight <unk> and we found two cases of natural death and when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was so <unk> that he &apos;s dead , and then they <unk> it .
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species .
<unk> the early &apos; <unk> , it was <unk> a really interesting task when my <unk> <unk> <unk> , if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> between <unk> society and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
To make sense of <unk> , I should have to understand the <unk> culture , and that the <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> vision .
Very interesting .
If you ask the <unk> of <unk> the great <unk> of the world , what would you <unk> me ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that Africa has no <unk> <unk> . And instead , yes , and the <unk> is nothing else that <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes it interesting is the <unk> of the <unk> between life and death .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> in a way that for a short moment , the <unk> becomes the <unk> .
And that is the <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> go to <unk> to <unk> the <unk> to speak of God .
We <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re <unk> , is the spirit that you have to you , how do you <unk> ?
So it <unk> to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather <unk> than the power of the mind when it &apos;s <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> that I &apos;ve lived with all the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> of blood , this <unk> never has been <unk> by <unk> .
And today , I &apos;m <unk> by a <unk> , but their education is extraordinary <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> by <unk> families to three or four years , and they live in a world that <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> of the <unk> of the nine years of <unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of mother , now are <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
For this time , they &apos;re <unk> to the values of their society , they <unk> that their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> .
And so , in this <unk> <unk> , they <unk> out and for the first time , they see a <unk> . And in that moment of <unk> &apos;s first <unk> , when the sun comes <unk> <unk> , and the sun <unk> <unk> <unk> , all that they have learned in theory , it &apos;s <unk> in all of the <unk> . The <unk> is <unk> <unk> . <unk> it back . <unk> is <unk> back .
&quot; <unk> ? <unk> how I said .
It &apos;s <unk> . Now it &apos;s you . &quot;
They &apos;re called <unk> <unk> more and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think about the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the old story of <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> in its <unk> or maybe <unk> and say that these <unk> are closer to the Earth .
The <unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by <unk> .
There is no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> , or in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , but because of the time and <unk> , and the <unk> , they &apos;ve created a <unk> of the Earth is not about the concept of <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> . <unk> : the concept that the Earth can only can be because it is human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
I mean that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> the mountain is a <unk> that <unk> its <unk> is going to be a <unk> different <unk> and will have a <unk> different relationship with the mountain or that <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> a mountain of <unk> that <unk> <unk> a mountain is a <unk> .
That &apos;s a <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
And that made me a human being different from my friends who believe that the <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> that live north <unk> .
If you go to <unk> that these <unk> can create different , we start to understand some of them , we could actually be able to understand some of them .
I <unk> this <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard of the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes a fascinating thing that makes <unk> is not the potential of the <unk> of the <unk> , but the <unk> .
On one hand , this <unk> <unk> that has a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> one has a <unk> <unk> , which <unk> a little bit of the <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> with a <unk> of a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you ever see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> that they make from a different <unk> , it <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . <unk> &apos;t creates a <unk> of the reality .
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> my <unk> can &apos;t be <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you &apos;re done , you can &apos;t tell anybody to be <unk> . <unk> can &apos;t be <unk> because they &apos;re <unk> by a <unk> that is , of course , in the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s possible to <unk> <unk> if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> .
Now this is the <unk> <unk> : the <unk> that are in this <unk> of <unk> , the same kind of <unk> <unk> , the same kind of <unk> to <unk> the <unk> . The <unk> question : in a <unk> <unk> of plants , like these <unk> <unk> two <unk> don &apos;t <unk> , but that if you <unk> this way , they create a version that is <unk> <unk> .
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you go to the <unk> , we <unk> , &quot; <unk> plants . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , who <unk> <unk> in the forest , and our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If you <unk> it as they <unk> their <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , you don &apos;t know ? &quot;
The solution is : you take the <unk> <unk> in a <unk> of the full <unk> and <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
And so , you don &apos;t <unk> to <unk> , but it &apos;s much more interesting that <unk> <unk> .
Now , &#91; the problem &#93; <unk> is that the ones that have to <unk> <unk> <unk> , but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of our real world , and it <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk> , but rather like the was that we <unk> and we <unk> <unk> or its <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> diversity and <unk> of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All the <unk> through the <unk> were <unk> in a new <unk> for life .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> don &apos;t have <unk> to be <unk> when they put their <unk> and <unk> like <unk> don &apos;t have <unk> to be <unk> when they put on the <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And if you look at a look at the world , you know that these are not <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They are <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of their <unk> , <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> capacity .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that lived in the <unk> to a generation ago , and I &apos;m going to <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in <unk> case , are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> .
If we <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> , where I &apos;m doing many research , you &apos;ll see the <unk> of politics .
As the <unk> <unk> , the physics of a <unk> , is <unk> to <unk> <unk> , but the <unk> , the <unk> of life , the <unk> of a <unk> , not only is it , but <unk> <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it &apos;s part of the development of the development of <unk> .
And you can &apos;t understand the <unk> of <unk> until it comes back from the beginning .
I <unk> miles from <unk> in the Western China through the Western <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only there is only <unk> behind <unk> that I realized .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> at the <unk> <unk> .
That means that it has been <unk> to the Chinese time .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that led to the <unk> <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in <unk> at age of two years <unk> under his <unk> because he couldn &apos;t have to live without him .
The <unk> , which was done the same , it was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
One day he <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , it was <unk> to work for seven years .
The pain of <unk> can be <unk> , but the spirit of <unk> is from <unk> .
<unk> , all of you <unk> to a choice .
Do you have to live in the world <unk> or we want to <unk> the world <unk> of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died told that his greatest fear was that , in our <unk> to the <unk> view of the world , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination , to a <unk> <unk> of thinking , but one day , we <unk> us from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it &apos;s <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , which <unk> us to <unk> agriculture , which <unk> us to <unk> the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , by creating the <unk> , by creating the <unk> of <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has <unk> over 300 years .
That <unk> story , I didn &apos;t tell you that we have the answers to all the challenges that we <unk> to go .
When the <unk> of these <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> <unk> different <unk> .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of being what we are : a <unk> species , which all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are great moments of <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the North <unk> of <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> me , and this man , <unk> me , <unk> the story of his <unk> .
The government didn &apos;t always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> <unk> , and in the <unk> for our <unk> , we <unk> them .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
The family , <unk> for life , <unk> away all the <unk> away all the <unk> , and all of her <unk> .
You have to know that <unk> don &apos;t <unk> the cold , you know .
The <unk> <unk> were made of fish <unk> in skin <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn &apos;t <unk> at night or <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> away , it &apos;s <unk> the <unk> in skin of <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did the <unk> , he <unk> them by creating a <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when he <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> , he <unk> another dog , and he &apos;s <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> to talk to <unk> ?
<unk> <unk> the government <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of an area of <unk> the bigger than the California &apos;s <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s their new <unk> . It &apos;s called <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s all the <unk> resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , finally , I think , is , at least , at least , at least , to the <unk> that they &apos;re not <unk> at all .
And so , it &apos;s home .
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the time . And for all of these children , like dreams of our children , become part of the <unk> <unk> of hope .
And finally , we &apos;re <unk> <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to anything .
I <unk> the <unk> --
&#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; they &#93; . But we believe that stories can change the world , and perhaps we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our website <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public places to <unk> our public places in <unk> of <unk> from what they &apos;ve seen and , they <unk> , <unk> , for a <unk> , <unk> for a <unk> <unk> , and we need to find a <unk> in a <unk> world , and we need to find a <unk> in a <unk> world .
where the <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> in our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I &apos;ve written in this book that I hope that you &apos;ve already heard and <unk> some <unk> , in case , not <unk> them .
I &apos;d like to start with what I call &quot; the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> <unk> what ?
The <unk> of all <unk> society <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> : &quot; If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens , &quot; The way to do it is to <unk> the freedom . &quot;
The reason is , on one hand , in fact that freedom is itself a value , is <unk> , useful , useful for humans .
<unk> else is , if we are <unk> , every one of us can do it for its own to do anything that <unk> our <unk> , without any one that <unk> our <unk> , without any one <unk> in our name .
The way to <unk> freedom is <unk> .
The more choices are the more <unk> , and the <unk> of the freedom , the more they are their <unk> .
This is , <unk> <unk> <unk> in society that nobody is <unk> <unk> in society that nobody is <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I &apos;ll show you some examples of what progress .
This is my <unk> . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to be a simple note on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in your <unk> .
This is what the <unk> is .
Then you go to the store , you go to buy one <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> .
And in this single store , there &apos;s a big number of <unk> <unk> .
We can make six million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one single one store .
<unk> <unk> there is <unk> choice .
<unk> <unk> : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the <unk> <unk> services , <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> the phone , you don &apos;t <unk> it .
A <unk> of that , between the other , was that the phone never <unk> .
These days they went .
Now we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> , especially between cell phones .
This is the <unk> of the future .
My <unk> is that in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you haven &apos;t seen it in the store , you &apos;re very few of the house , you &apos;re very soon going to be <unk> .
And what happens is that people get in the <unk> and they ask this question . And you know , is the answer ? The answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do anything .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , it <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : It &apos;s not going on in the United States that you &apos;re <unk> from <unk> and the <unk> <unk> you have to do .
Instead , <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> says , &quot; OK , we can do it , or <unk> , &quot; A <unk> , &quot; and he &apos;s going to be <unk> and these <unk> . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You said , &quot; <unk> , what do you do you do ? &quot;
And the <unk> says , &quot; He has these <unk> and these <unk> , and <unk> <unk> these <unk> and <unk> these <unk> . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; <unk> if you were me , what would you say ? &quot;
And the <unk> , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call it &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> that makes it look beautiful .
But actually , it &apos;s not that one <unk> the weight and the <unk> of <unk> decisions that something , <unk> the <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> , to <unk> the other than not -- and certainly is <unk> -- and not in the <unk> <unk> to make decisions .
There &apos;s a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me and you , that if you think about it , you think , don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to be .
But if we can &apos;t <unk> , why do we <unk> them ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> that we call the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> of so <unk> is our <unk> now is a question of choice , as you see in this <unk> . &quot; We don &apos;t want to <unk> the children . We want to say , &quot; We don &apos;t want to <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times we do it .
That means that every <unk> , at <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
<unk> to the family and <unk> , a time perspective , the common perspective , almost for anyone , was that <unk> us as soon as possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and what they do after .
<unk> , all of that is really to play .
I &apos;m going to go very smart students , and they <unk> their 20 percent <unk> .
And not because they &apos;re less <unk> , they &apos;re not <unk> .
but why I &apos;m <unk> , you know , you know , &quot; <unk> <unk> or not ? <unk> do it now ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> later ? I have to think before the children or the career ? &quot;
They are <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this <unk> doesn &apos;t <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and <unk> don &apos;t get a <unk> <unk> at my <unk> .
And they really have to do that .
Now , the work : we &apos;re <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because technology allows us to work every single day , every day , from every corner of the planet , <unk> that from the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> , and I won &apos;t tell anybody what , where the <unk> works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What does that mean , this incredible freedom of choice , which we have to decide , <unk> at all , if we need to work or not .
We can go to see our son , play with the mobile phone , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , on the <unk> .
And even though they &apos;re all <unk> , every minute we see our son , <unk> the <unk> , we &apos;re also <unk> , we &apos;re also <unk> , &quot; I should answer this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this <unk> ? I have to <unk> this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , this makes the experience of your <unk> . &quot; <unk> a very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the things , you know , small , and <unk> objects , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but not all of it was a <unk> .
The world today is this : The <unk> is , &quot; Is it a <unk> , or <unk> ? &quot;
The answer is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the <unk> .
<unk> this <unk> choice two effects of people .
The first one , <unk> , is that it <unk> instead of <unk> .
With a lot of <unk> that you have to have , it &apos;s very difficult to do .
I &apos;ll give you a <unk> example : a <unk> study <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> has had access to the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> society , with about a million <unk> <unk> in <unk> different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> more , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s 10 percent <unk> than when they &apos;re available than when they &apos;re available only five . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> <unk> between them , is it <unk> to decide , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> never comes to the <unk> .
<unk> that doesn &apos;t just mean that these <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don &apos;t have enough money , even to say that the decision is so <unk> that they <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re not <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> to five <unk> per year from <unk> <unk> , which would be <unk> to <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of having choices .
And I think that &apos;s going to <unk> the world .
&quot; And finally , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
You can just make the right decision , if it &apos;s for the <unk> , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong <unk> , and you <unk> the wrong <unk> .
So , this is the first effect . The second effect is that even though we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice , we &apos;re less <unk> by the result of how we <unk> states with less <unk> between the <unk> .
And that for different reasons .
One of these is that with many <unk> between the one and you didn &apos;t have a <unk> one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could make a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> the <unk> <unk> from the decision , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> from the decision ,
even when it was a <unk> decision .
The more choices there are , the more easy <unk> than any <unk> that is <unk> <unk> of the choice .
And , it &apos;s what <unk> call <unk> .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well <unk> how the value we give things <unk> from what we give things to <unk> from what we <unk> .
<unk> , you know , when there are lots of <unk> possible , it &apos;s easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> that you have .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m going to <unk> with all those who are not New York .
But that &apos;s what it probably <unk> .
There &apos;s this <unk> to the <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It &apos;s all for them .
Not anything . But what he thinks , &quot; Well , <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> are away . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> right in front of home . &quot;
And it <unk> two weeks <unk> from the idea that &apos;s <unk> -- every day -- the possibility of <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> the <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the <unk> that we have from <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It &apos;s about living the moment , and maybe in the slowly of the way .
But the most important thing is that you <unk> , you will be not do other .
The things that don &apos;t have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried it <unk> a new <unk> .
It &apos;s going to be <unk> .
Once the <unk> were just one guy , and <unk> them from <unk> , they were <unk> , and they were <unk> , only after <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of times , I &apos;d like to go .
So , I started to <unk> a couple of the new when the <unk> were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> said , &quot; Do you want to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
<unk> them wants to <unk> with <unk> ? &quot; <unk> &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- &quot; <unk> to <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after some of my <unk> , &quot; I want the guy that was the only guy . &quot; He didn &apos;t have any idea of what it was , like , for a <unk> . I &apos;m going to <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then <unk> out of the <unk> , <unk> , I had the <unk> <unk> , I had the <unk> <unk> .
It was the <unk> . With all that choice I had to do the best .
But I &apos;m worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to <unk> .
The reason I was that I was worse with all that choice , my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
And I had <unk> <unk> . I didn &apos;t <unk> anything that <unk> when I just had one like this , but when I was 100 different , at least one time , at least one guy had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After I <unk> that I was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in life of people don &apos;t do that <unk> the <unk> that these have <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> .
And that &apos;s <unk> less <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of <unk> if it <unk> .
Because if I &apos;m going to <unk> it , I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more to that .
&quot; You were better when you were worse , &quot; The reason he was better when he was worse was even <unk> as he was worse than it was even <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live in -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things to the <unk> .
You &apos;ve never seen that because your <unk> , my <unk> , you know , my <unk> , they <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you are here -- is , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; Yes , you want to . &quot;
I mean , little <unk> moment -- that I &apos;m really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn &apos;t have done better , I didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
But <unk> isn &apos;t always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of <unk> a couple of <unk> <unk> when there is only that kind of <unk> is that when you &apos;re not <unk> , and you will tell you , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is <unk> ? &quot; , the answer is <unk> .
The world is the <unk> . What could I do with that ?
When there are hundreds of <unk> , and you get one <unk> , and you <unk> one <unk> , and you <unk> who is the clear , it &apos;s clear that the <unk> you are .
I could do better .
With hundreds of <unk> <unk> , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even if the result is <unk> , they <unk> <unk> and they give them the same .
In the last few years , the <unk> is <unk> in the world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only one , but -- of this <unk> of <unk> is just that people have experiences because the <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation is that <unk> .
So the final result is that in general , we &apos;re better , <unk> , but we &apos;re worse .
Let me just give you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely <unk> . It &apos;s not true .
There is no <unk> that some of choice is better than that , but from this <unk> not that much choice is better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a <unk> value , <unk> . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve <unk> from a piece of the level that the choices <unk> our life .
Now , from <unk> &apos;s <unk> -- I &apos;ve almost finished -- from the point of view , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What it allows all of this choice in <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you have <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that they have choice .
The problem is that they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I &apos;m talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what he does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> has talked about yesterday about how those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> are <unk> .
I mean , these choices , <unk> and <unk> , not that they &apos;re just <unk> .
They are <unk> <unk> .
They do have worse .
If we have some of what in our society allows us to <unk> us to be <unk> in those where people have too much chance , it would not only be their lives to <unk> but also our <unk> .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income is good at all -- not only about the poor people -- not just to the poor people -- because of this choice in <unk> that <unk> us .
And finally , &quot; <unk> , you can become what you want . &quot;
<unk> , people of culture , <unk> , &quot; What would you do that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s <unk> that you can &apos;t do anything in a glass <unk> . &quot;
&quot; A <unk> <unk> , a <unk> view of the world --
And I <unk> it , I <unk> it , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I realized that fish the fish knows that fish knows the long knows .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you <unk> the <unk> , so that &quot; everything is possible . &quot; You don &apos;t <unk> the freedom . &quot;
If you <unk> the <unk> in a way that you can <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
They all need a <unk> .
This is almost certainly <unk> , it &apos;s even <unk> for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for the <unk> .
Thank you very much .
