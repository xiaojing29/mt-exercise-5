<unk> year I showed these <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years has been the <unk> <unk> in the United States , <unk> , has <unk> of the United States , has <unk> 40 percent .
I <unk> this <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a sense , the heart of the climate system .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You can see , it <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That &apos;s the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> in summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , <unk> ice , <unk> , is like the blood , which here is <unk> from the body .
In 25 years it went on to 25 years .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> around the ocean <unk> where there are huge <unk> of <unk> <unk> that , <unk> , are <unk> in <unk> .
We &apos;re going to <unk> <unk> by global <unk> , that amount of <unk> , that amount of <unk> , <unk> this point of not <unk> .
In some of the <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> is already <unk> by water .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> was <unk> with a <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> last <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! Al <unk> : She &apos;s fine . The question is if we <unk> it .
One is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the north .
This is a river in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> had never <unk> like that .
This is the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how you go <unk> the sea level to <unk> on <unk> , here is where the sea is where the sea is .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> on the planet : <unk> , the largest <unk> , the largest ice <unk> of the planet .
<unk> month scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of ice is in <unk> , and that the Western <unk> , which is <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> at six meters of the <unk> , as in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the third largest <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which few years ago were <unk> .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population <unk> water from that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : This <unk> is the source of <unk> water in this city .
The <unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same happens to <unk> water .
In California , <unk> on <unk> <unk> is <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> 40 percent .
<unk> <unk> are in crisis .
<unk> , as you read , as you read , they &apos;re <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the world door to a <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and without <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years in <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the whole <unk> .
If you look at it in the <unk> context , you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we &apos;ve <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the ocean every day .
Look at <unk> the area of the <unk> <unk> , from <unk> , to <unk> , and on both the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where there is a <unk> <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean .
The largest cause of global warming , together to <unk> , which is <unk> use <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions with China .
And you can build a lot of other <unk> <unk> .
But we &apos;re <unk> to a <unk> of direction .
These are the <unk> projects over the past years and some <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there &apos;s a political <unk> in our own country .
The <unk> of <unk> and oil have <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I <unk> image something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> <unk> .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it on the <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> in America .
It &apos;s happened around <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> â™« <unk> <unk> is a <unk> and happy .
It &apos;s been here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> .
It &apos;s at good price , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Al <unk> : From here , I &apos;m a lot of <unk> <unk> .
The largest <unk> society on the <unk> <unk> is <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> , Al <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al <unk> : So the <unk> <unk> <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , one of them .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> , we see the <unk> changes like a <unk> <unk> in our business .
That &apos;s why we have a lot of money in a <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> the truth about <unk> .
It &apos;s not <unk> .
We think it &apos;s <unk> -- it &apos;s also a good <unk> .
So we don &apos;t have to <unk> climate change .
We can do it to us .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you &apos;ve heard about it very much .
So , I <unk> a turn into a <unk> structure as far as <unk> .
<unk> ! The machines are a little <unk> , but that &apos;s the sound of <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> is between the <unk> <unk> of global warming , but <unk> technology that <unk> you see change everything .
And then , you have a look at this : this is the <unk> <unk> technology .
Al <unk> : <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> is in the crisis ; the economy , <unk> , the national security crisis .
The <unk> that all the <unk> that all of us from <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and <unk> .
Now , though , there &apos;s a new way to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A <unk> for <unk> America to work , <unk> more <unk> , and help <unk> the global <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we can <unk> our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
<unk> : That &apos;s the last one .
<unk> : That &apos;s about <unk> energy to America .
One of the most <unk> of <unk> , we end up from the <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , a new <unk> network .
<unk> <unk> 2 : <unk> <unk> for jobs .
<unk> : <unk> America . It &apos;s time to be <unk> .
And Al <unk> : A <unk> <unk> <unk> says , &quot; If you want to go to yourself .
If you want to go far , you go . &quot;
We have to go far away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED I made an <unk> on <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to try to <unk> about how the car works .
So here it is . And for those that other time , there were no <unk> , the <unk> is the largest experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were in the <unk> of the universe -- until <unk> million times per second .
That &apos;s just <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> these <unk> <unk> into the <unk> .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> feet and it &apos;s <unk> meters .
This is a <unk> image of <unk> in construction . And you can see the <unk> .
<unk> 10 <unk> last year , we &apos;ve <unk> the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> of particles that she had done all the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> particles inside the <unk> .
In other words , when you look at that image the 10 <unk> , you know that the <unk> machine , which is a great <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if that was <unk> to do that , when somebody <unk> on Google and they would say the <unk> page was this .
That means we have a <unk> impact over to that scientific .
And I was a week later , there was a problem with the car , to just these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works when the car works at the <unk> <unk> .
Now , the <unk> of you <unk> <unk> and <unk> , &quot; It &apos;s not true . I &apos;m <unk> too <unk> . &quot;
And they can do it because when they &apos;re very <unk> , they become <unk> <unk> .
So , <unk> degrees <unk> , at least <unk> degrees <unk> to that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
That was the <unk> .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think that these are going to be more than 20 <unk> , and <unk> <unk> about 30 <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , which we &apos;ve done .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
Now they &apos;re now <unk> everybody to their <unk> .
<unk> the end of <unk> <unk> is going to be new <unk> .
We <unk> it , and we &apos;ll try to get data <unk> or <unk> , and continue so our <unk> to find out what are the <unk> that are <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of science and engineering . It &apos;s easy to <unk> .
I think that &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s so hard , I think that &apos;s the value of things like <unk> .
I &apos;d like to <unk> with the words of a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which , in <unk> of <unk> experiments in <unk> , his <unk> was Michael <unk> , who was <unk> , said , &quot; No is much <unk> that the ideas of human mind as the <unk> that the ideas of the science are <unk> , that our <unk> are <unk> , and that our <unk> are <unk> , and that we don &apos;t have new <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> <unk> in <unk> when , as children , <unk> with <unk> .
As I was <unk> as <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , we actually <unk> and to <unk> problems .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way most of the world around us .
So , as a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started to say , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having the <unk> <unk> as a digital <unk> that <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> on a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
and we &apos;re going to be <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that I could explore the answer , building <unk> .
<unk> , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as big as a <unk> .
<unk> , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as big as a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , they can <unk> their <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
But <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> them .
<unk> are example of a new <unk> <unk> to <unk> the digital information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement , the other people . And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement , <unk> of the other , how we <unk> them , we can explore new <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ll start with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you some of the video . If you put it in one direction , the <unk> video so , if you were to the other side .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , you know what it &apos;s them around .
If they &apos;re <unk> , they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
If they &apos;re <unk> , they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
They also have their movement and <unk> .
We then realized that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was that you could use common on data , like , &quot; <unk> &quot; a color like it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> it to <unk> the color in that central , where you <unk> .
and I can <unk> it to <unk> the color of that in the central to the central to where you <unk> .
If you get too much , we can <unk> a little bit of a <unk> .
There are also <unk> possibilities of <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , <unk> and <unk> where people can try things quickly , and they &apos;re going to have the results immediately .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of <unk> I &apos;m doing with a <unk> program .
Here we have a game of words that is in half between <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , in every <unk> , a letter <unk> on every <unk> , <unk> , at every <unk> , at every <unk> , a letter <unk> on every <unk> , and as I was <unk> in a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds <unk> , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
There are some kids who were <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> , I made so that I <unk> them and I <unk> a video .
They &apos;re very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things like this <unk> is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just wanted to say , &quot; <unk> of the words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , there on the right .
It actually wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You have to build a tool for <unk> <unk> . He &apos;s <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
Well , it &apos;s <unk> the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now he brought a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> work ! Yeah !
So , we <unk> <unk> and <unk> can make the characters ,
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> their own story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have the time to show you is a tool that made of a tool , which is made to <unk> and <unk> music .
It &apos;s a tool , which is recently , to <unk> and <unk> music .
<unk> here are <unk> as <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of these have four different <unk> , and you can use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence from <unk> to your <unk> .
And we &apos;re just doing a <unk> <unk> , &quot; sound &quot; and a <unk> . &quot;
These are side effects that you can control from me , like <unk> and <unk> .
They &apos;re going to <unk> it to a particular <unk> , and then they &apos;re going to <unk> .
And then you have the <unk> effects of time and <unk> , which is <unk> to the whole sequence .
<unk> how it works .
<unk> : <unk> one of two <unk> <unk> , &quot; sequence , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> in a series , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
Now let &apos;s take a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> : I &apos;m going to <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> : And I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> to the <unk> , so I can control the <unk> to live <unk> .
<unk> : I can <unk> the entire sequence of time on one side or the other .
<unk> : <unk> : And now you get the <unk> <unk> at the bottom to give <unk> .
<unk> : I can <unk> the sequence of <unk> .
So I don &apos;t have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> it , <unk> long , <unk> , <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> on the left the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , how our brain work and body .
And today , I &apos;ve been <unk> to show you one of the results of this path and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
And the concept I want to <unk> is that it &apos;s <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> , which <unk> information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time I &apos;m going to talk to you .
I &apos;m a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and my <unk> of life .
And I don &apos;t expect to be changing .
But , this one , something that happened to my life , and in my life , which led me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I &apos;ve <unk> this book , this <unk> called &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which , <unk> , &quot; which , I <unk> my <unk> books , for some reason for <unk> <unk> in the world and <unk> a big <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the <unk> is that everywhere I will , people like I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> .
I &apos;m going to go to me now and say , &quot; You don &apos;t have any <unk> you can &apos;t do better ?
You don &apos;t <unk> to be <unk> all of the life that you can be able to create a book that can <unk> someone to do you ? &quot;
<unk> that can be <unk> to someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , except I remember that over 20 years ago , when I started saying to say to people -- I was an <unk> -- that I wanted to be a <unk> .
I was going to be at the same <unk> <unk> .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you believe I couldn &apos;t have successful ?
You don &apos;t fear you <unk> <unk> ?
You don &apos;t fear you &apos;re not afraid to go out and die on a <unk> of <unk> . And you &apos;re never going to be out on a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> like that , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yeah , I &apos;m afraid to all of those things .
I &apos;ve always been afraid .
And I also <unk> of many other things that people could not be <unk> .
Like <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as I think , the <unk> I thought and <unk> <unk> is that ?
Is it <unk> ?
It &apos;s <unk> that anyone who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job you feel to do .
But what &apos;s about this particular <unk> in <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not ?
How my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I don &apos;t remember one time in his 40 years of <unk> in his <unk> , if he was <unk> <unk> ?
There was never -- that <unk> of the <unk> John , like that ?
Don &apos;t <unk> that way , <unk> ?
<unk> , engineers <unk> as a group has no certainly , in <unk> , <unk> <unk> being <unk> <unk> .
We have enough , we have enough this <unk> , and not just <unk> but <unk> of all kinds of <unk> , we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s nothing else that look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , young and often as they .
And the ones that don &apos;t seem to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before I die , in the last <unk> said , &quot; Every my book <unk> me a little bit more . &quot; <unk> <unk> about the work of their life .
But we didn &apos;t know when we were <unk> it to say , because we &apos;ve heard these things that are so <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are <unk> that creativity and art , at the <unk> that art , at the <unk> .
And the question I want to ask you to all this is : <unk> with this idea ?
You &apos;re fine with this thing -- because it &apos;s <unk> from a <unk> away to me not .
I think it &apos;s <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s also <unk> and I don &apos;t want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to <unk> our <unk> to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> towards <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I am in my career .
<unk> -- I mean , I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;ve got about 40 years .
I still have about four <unk> of work in me .
And it &apos;s very <unk> that whatever you &apos;re going to be <unk> by the world as the work that <unk> after my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we &apos;re all about friends here -- it &apos;s <unk> that my largest success is my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , that thought !
You know , the kind of thought that leads to a person to start <unk> to nine <unk> <unk> at nine <unk> <unk> . And I don &apos;t want to do it .
I want to continue doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so I think , after many <unk> , that the way to work to continue to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to get a distance from me between me , which I &apos;m <unk> , and I &apos;m <unk> , and my natural <unk> on what the <unk> wrote . And as I was <unk> for the past year , models on how to do it <unk> , looking through the time , trying to find other societies to see if you have a <unk> , you know , you have some of the best <unk> .
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research has led me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
Because I was <unk> in <unk> and then <unk> .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don &apos;t believe that <unk> creativity from men , OK ?
It turns out that creativity was this <unk> spirit and <unk> from some <unk> to men and <unk> from some <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for reasons and <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity . <unk> <unk> of creativity <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , you will have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from far away .
<unk> were the same idea , but they were that sort of <unk> with a <unk> .
which is <unk> , because the <unk> didn &apos;t really feel that a <unk> was particularly smart somebody .
I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> literally in the <unk> of a artist &apos;s study , a little artist like the <unk> <unk> , and it <unk> out to <unk> the work of the artist &apos;s work and <unk> the <unk> of that work .
<unk> <unk> , that &apos;s the distance I talk -- that <unk> <unk> you from your <unk> <unk> from your <unk> <unk> of your work .
And everyone thought that was so that you were <unk> , right ?
So , the <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like the too <unk> , right ?
If your work was <unk> you didn &apos;t want to <unk> all the <unk> , you all know that you were <unk> from this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it was not all <unk> you , right ?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> creativity <unk> in <unk> for a long time .
And then the <unk> <unk> and everything <unk> , and we <unk> this great idea ; we put this great idea , we put the human being at the center of the universe on the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> space on the <unk> .
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people started to think that <unk> creativity completely from <unk> .
And for the first time in history , you start to <unk> this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> rather than one person with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think you &apos;re going to be a <unk> , and I think I &apos;m like to believe that you &apos;re like a source , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> is a responsibility to too big to give to human <unk> .
It &apos;s like to ask someone to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely the <unk> and creates all of these <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s been this pressure to have come back to the next 500 years .
And if that &apos;s true , and I think it &apos;s , the question becomes , and I think it becomes ,
Can we do it <unk> ?
They want to go back to a <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t do 500 years of thinking <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on their <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , do you <unk> , you make people <unk> to <unk> about their projects .
You probably don &apos;t care all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to say is -- why don &apos;t I ?
Why don &apos;t we do this ?
Because more sense of everything that I &apos;ve ever heard about to explain the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process .
A process that , as anyone who has ever <unk> to do something -- so basically , everyone here -- you don &apos;t <unk> <unk> .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seem completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , who has now 90 years , but it &apos;s been a <unk> for the whole life and said that during his <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the fields , I was <unk> out in the fields , and I <unk> , in the fields of <unk> .
He said that he was like a <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> to her from <unk> .
We were going to <unk> , because he was <unk> the earth under his feet .
I decided to have one thing to do to do at that point and it was to say , &quot; <unk> like a <unk> . &quot;
And so I went back to home and he was <unk> by this <unk> , and he wouldn &apos;t have anything else that take a piece of paper and a <unk> that &apos;s pretty quickly as a <unk> , <unk> and <unk> on the page .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to be enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without getting to get to home and <unk> it through the <unk> and she would <unk> her through the <unk> , looking , like she said , &quot; one more <unk> . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this piece of the time -- there were almost -- there were times when the <unk> , you know , you know ?
So , he was <unk> at home and he was looking for paper and <unk> <unk> through , and he was <unk> his <unk> , and then he was <unk> , and then he said , that was like , if you were with the other hand and the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and <unk> in his body and <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> and <unk> , but <unk> , from the last word to the first word .
So when <unk> <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
I &apos;m not a <unk> . I &apos;m not a <unk> .
I &apos;m a <unk> , and my way to <unk> is ; I <unk> it all the same <unk> every day and <unk> and work and <unk> and <unk> <unk> over <unk> .
But even I , in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I would say that many of you will do .
You know , even though the work and the ideas I could <unk> myself from a certain source of the source I could not <unk> <unk> .
And what &apos;s this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it so we don &apos;t <unk> to <unk> , but rather , rather than <unk> it ?
And as I think , the best example , which I &apos;ve <unk> is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;ve been <unk> several years ago for a <unk> .
I was talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> artist , <unk> <unk> , trying to control , these species of <unk> totally <unk> .
But then <unk> , he was <unk> , and he was <unk> on a day as he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> everything .
It &apos;s going fast and everything about a <unk> <unk> , this little <unk> of <unk> , who comes in his head like <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the <unk> , but not know how to <unk> .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it has no <unk> .
So you start to hear this kind of old <unk> , <unk> , and I &apos;m going to <unk> it , and I &apos;m going to start to lose this song .
I &apos;m not <unk> enough and I can &apos;t <unk> . &quot;
And instead of going to <unk> , you know .
We were <unk> the entire process , and made something new .
I just wanted to the sky and said , &quot; <unk> , you don &apos;t see that I &apos;m <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Do you think it can write a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you know , you &apos;re going to get care when I can care for you .
<unk> , I &apos;ll be <unk> to <unk> more .
You can <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And his process <unk> <unk> after that .
It wasn &apos;t working , it was still <unk> as always as well as it .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when the <unk> , the <unk> that he was <unk> when he was <unk> , the <unk> that he was <unk> that he was <unk> from , and he was <unk> that he was <unk> that he was <unk> and <unk> .
But I was this <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> a conversation that &apos;s a conversation that &apos;s <unk> and <unk> , but it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
And as I was , I &apos;m going to tell you that story to change a little bit .
This idea , I &apos;m <unk> when I was <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; and I <unk> in one of those <unk> <unk> in which everybody was when we &apos;re working on something and we &apos;re working on something and we &apos;re not going to be <unk> , which will be the book will be the <unk> .
Not just <unk> , just the <unk> book .
And I started thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I was <unk> to <unk> that I <unk> to the air .
So I <unk> my face up from <unk> and <unk> , and I <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> corner of the room .
And I said to <unk> , &quot; <unk> , what , you know , you know that if this book is not going to be <unk> <unk> , my <unk> , no ?
Because you see I &apos;m <unk> about everything I have , I have no more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to <unk> and do your <unk> .
Okay . But if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , I don &apos;t do anything .
I started to write the the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to <unk> that it was <unk> that I &apos;m now <unk> to do my <unk> . &quot; Because at the end of Africa , &quot; Because it &apos;s like , &quot; <unk> &quot; -- it &apos;s a <unk> ago in the <unk> of Africa , and music that they were <unk> for <unk> and <unk> for hours to <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every while , you know , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> .
And I know you know about what I talk , because I know you have all of it , at some point , a <unk> like this .
It was like time , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it was not doing anything different from the usually , like <unk> <unk> <unk> before , but everything was <unk> .
And suddenly , we don &apos;t just <unk> like a human .
But you <unk> from <unk> and <unk> in the fire of <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people knew what was , the <unk> with his name .
<unk> hands and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; to &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which is still you can hear in <unk> or in <unk> .
In <unk> , when a artist has done something impossible and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it &apos;s <unk> because we need it .
But , the problem comes the day after , for <unk> itself , when you go and <unk> and <unk> that are the 11 of the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of God doesn &apos;t have more .
It &apos;s just a <unk> with a lot of <unk> to <unk> , and perhaps never <unk> to <unk> .
And maybe nobody is <unk> the name of God again as I was <unk> , and what has to do with his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so <unk> if you can &apos;t believe , <unk> , <unk> , that the most <unk> <unk> of your being come from yourself .
But you just want to <unk> you that data from a <unk> source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to somebody else when you &apos;re finished .
And , you know , if we think that way that we think about it .
And so I started <unk> , and it &apos;s certainly like I <unk> it for several months during the <unk> of the book that <unk> soon , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of my success .
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel like this is , I &apos;m not afraid to be afraid .
You don &apos;t <unk> . You just have your work .
You &apos;re going to <unk> for your <unk> , whatever it is .
If your work is <unk> , you know .
If the <unk> , you &apos;re going to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for one moment through your <unk> , then <unk> !
<unk> , you make the same <unk> .
And &quot; <unk> ! &quot; to yourself .
I think it &apos;s about it and I think it &apos;s <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; to yourself , even for having had love and <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
And as you know I &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects about the human genome , about what <unk> and discovery of new genes .
We &apos;re now <unk> a new path . We have started <unk> biology and now starting from that digital code , we &apos;re <unk> in a new <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
We &apos;ve been trying to ask them to ask them to ask them ,
&quot; What &apos;s life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many <unk> I think have <unk> <unk> that I think have <unk> that I think have <unk> that I think have <unk> that I think have <unk> that I think have <unk> <unk> to different levels .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> for almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome has been <unk> to go from the <unk> world <unk> by the digital world of computer .
Now , let &apos;s ask you : Can we <unk> life , or create new life that digital ?
This is the map of a small <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species of the <unk> genome between those that they can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> a little more small .
We can <unk> a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that are here .
But when we take a look at his <unk> map , it &apos;s <unk> as simple as we are .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at a time , it &apos;s very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell .
So I thought that the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> in a way that you could <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of &quot; Can we <unk> a <unk> ? &quot;
Can the chemical <unk> of producing these big molecules that we &apos;ve never done before ?
And in case , can we make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The speed with which we &apos;re able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the <unk> code , instead of <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> .
And our most <unk> results lead to a <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve been over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before they <unk> the first experiments .
But we found that DNA <unk> is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> process : the more <unk> is a <unk> process : the more <unk> is a <unk> process .
So we had to develop a new way to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And that was our first <unk> , starting from information digital information , <unk> genome that digital <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a little virus that <unk> bacteria .
We designed <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> it in bacteria , the bacteria have <unk> to read this <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> particles .
<unk> particles have been <unk> from cells , they &apos;re <unk> back and they <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ve been talking about <unk> members of the <unk> industry that they &apos;ve been <unk> this model .
They &apos;ve <unk> more than you .
I think this is a situation where the software can really build its same <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we could do things in the big things .
You have to build the entire <unk> of <unk> .
They are more than <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> code .
So we thought we were <unk> in <unk> of the size of the virus , so that we can change the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> information with <unk> information in a computer , these must be very <unk> .
When you <unk> this genome was the first time in <unk> , the standard <unk> was of a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve discovered , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If you were used that original sequence never could do it .
A part of the process is design <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> <unk> <unk> to build smaller <unk> that <unk> together .
<unk> elements here .
You probably read that you have read that you have read that you .
So , we have a <unk> code that <unk> <unk> on four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , about 20 <unk> , and there &apos;s a <unk> order to <unk> to every <unk> .
So we can use <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
What we &apos;ve done at the beginning was <unk> .
Some of them have been <unk> by the way that it was not <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But at all , we &apos;ve made these <unk> in <unk> so that we &apos;re trying to create an extremely <unk> <unk> <unk> as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to <unk> the process .
So , this looks like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
When you start these <unk> <unk> much more than 100 <unk> <unk> , you don &apos;t <unk> more directly into the <unk> <unk> .
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> biology .
So we &apos;ve <unk> other <unk> .
I was going to talk about another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA .
Here &apos;s an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , it can <unk> three million <unk> <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> like his <unk> is <unk> .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s been <unk> as it was before .
<unk> of thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely <unk> .
You have to live under <unk> .
I &apos;m sure that life <unk> in space , and you <unk> to find new <unk> <unk> of water .
Actually , NASA showed that this is happening .
This is a picture of the <unk> we &apos;ve built these <unk> , just using the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> them .
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s such a big <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we &apos;ve done a little bit of time ago .
They are more than <unk> <unk> of <unk> code .
It &apos;s the largest <unk> structure ever <unk> by a <unk> structure ever <unk> by man .
It has a <unk> weight over 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 <unk> , you &apos;d just <unk> pages to <unk> this <unk> code .
Now , how do we make it work ? How do we <unk> ?
<unk> , by a virus is a <unk> game .
It &apos;s a little bit more <unk> when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s <unk> cells , even when it comes to <unk> cells like it : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the <unk> process .
In <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> in the cell , but we have <unk> <unk> that we can make a <unk> <unk> of a cell <unk> from one cell to cell to another and of <unk> .
We have a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> species .
The two are the one of the <unk> men .
We &apos;ve <unk> some <unk> <unk> more so that you can decide what you &apos;ve got to choose what you &apos;ve got to choose to this <unk> .
He then <unk> it with <unk> so that he <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> . We <unk> our <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in the cell .
And we had to <unk> that we didn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to <unk> more .
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere , you know , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So , those people think of evolution as a <unk> , it has not understood a lot of the biology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell didn &apos;t <unk> one .
The <unk> <unk> we have <unk> it .
It &apos;s <unk> , and it has <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> , and it <unk> it , and we <unk> with only the cell and the cell <unk> .
It &apos;s become blue because of the genes we &apos;ve <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all of the <unk> of a species , you have to go <unk> , and it <unk> of all into a new species , <unk> on the new software we &apos;ve <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> exactly what we &apos;ve <unk> .
Now , this may seem <unk> <unk> , but we can <unk> the software DNA change things in a pretty <unk> way .
Now , I &apos;ve already <unk> that you &apos;re not talking about <unk> -- but about <unk> from three million years and a half million evolution years of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> in which we &apos;re going to <unk> new species to this process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give you an example : I was born in <unk> .
Now , there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in <unk> ; in the <unk> , and there are four .
We &apos;re <unk> problems now to find food , <unk> water and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> for six billion and a half billion people .
We &apos;re going to have to do it for nine billion .
We have more than five billion <unk> , over 30 billion <unk> .
That means 100 million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process of <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
And we need to realize that all the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
And I like today , because of the <unk> <unk> in the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that they are <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry <unk> only a <unk> about <unk> , and you think how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from reality and our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , because of these <unk> <unk> <unk> , that can <unk> <unk> , that we call <unk> <unk> .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think about <unk> these 20 million genes , or <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of a small team , and we can change , with a small team , and create more biology than in the past 20 years .
And it &apos;s just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> , chemical <unk> or chemistry , chemical <unk> , chemical <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we &apos;re working on to be able to <unk> and design and design species at the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how to be .
We know exactly what their <unk> is what their <unk> code .
We &apos;re <unk> on the <unk> <unk> generation .
You saw you that <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We &apos;ve <unk> second and third generation that will be pretty soon from <unk> to <unk> more than the <unk> <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a huge impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> CO2 as , which we &apos;re working to design cells that are going to be able to achieve , and we think we could have the first <unk> <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> solar <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> in the world , we &apos;ve found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> we <unk> in <unk> .
It &apos;s going to be in the deep ocean , about <unk> meters <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> by <unk> , by using <unk> <unk> , by energy source .
We &apos;re trying to understand whether we can <unk> CO2 , which can easily be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , we think we might be able to <unk> what we might be able to <unk> what the question is life is , &quot; We have the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole <unk> industry .
<unk> . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t ?
We have a major source of energy .
And we &apos;re working on the same for using the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk> .
You saw this year with the flu , we &apos;re always <unk> a year and with a dollar less when it comes to find the right <unk> .
I think that you can change building <unk> in <unk> .
And that &apos;s how the future could begin to look at <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> the <unk> that <unk> , <unk> , and finally <unk> cells .
We &apos;re so <unk> to <unk> people .
Our purpose is to do in a way of living long enough to try to <unk> . Thank you very much .
First of all , I &apos;m going to show you , the <unk> possible , some fundamental work , of the new technology we &apos;ve brought to <unk> into a <unk> <unk> . <unk> at a <unk> . That &apos;s <unk> .
It &apos;s a environment in which you can <unk> is at local level that you can <unk> it with huge <unk> of <unk> data .
Here we &apos;re seeing <unk> of photos <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> and <unk> , for a quick <unk> , <unk> , <unk> the images as we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much the amount of information that we see , how big it is that you see , how big it <unk> of data or images .
Most of them are common photographs , but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that <unk> <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on the screen in any . It &apos;s also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , which is not of images .
This is <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> is a <unk> .
And so , you know , it &apos;s not about images and <unk> , we can do something like that , to actually see that it &apos;s a real <unk> <unk> , not a picture .
It could be a way that you could read a <unk> book .
You can &apos;t <unk> it .
This is a more <unk> example . This is about a <unk> number of The <unk> .
Every image one of the great is the beginning of a <unk> .
And I really <unk> you really feel about how you read the real experience of being <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature like a half .
We also made something with the corner of the number of The <unk> .
We &apos;ve created a <unk> <unk> much higher than what you use in a normal <unk> , and we &apos;ve <unk> <unk> content .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even the <unk> <unk> .
And that really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
I would say that this is going to put very <unk> and other <unk> <unk> , not to be <unk> .
Of course , <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to <unk> , for the <unk> that we have <unk> to give in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> over a <unk> image .
So now , let &apos;s just go back to something else .
This is actually live on the web ; you can <unk> them to see .
It &apos;s a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a very interesting <unk> computer in the very interesting computer that is a <unk> student of Washington , with <unk> help <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s live on the web , <unk> <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can <unk> from one image to another and have this kind of experience <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here actually has a meaning .
The <unk> <unk> of the computer <unk> have <unk> these images together , so that they <unk> to <unk> places where the <unk> all near <unk> <unk> <unk> . And here &apos;s what you see here of a <unk> <unk> , and these things have been all <unk> to the <unk> <unk> , and these things have been all <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if I have any other environment to show you some other environment .
There are some more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> <unk> data , and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that we &apos;ve done for the first time in the summer <unk> to show what <unk> is really the key behind this technology , <unk> . And it &apos;s not <unk> that much <unk> by looking at the <unk> that we have to do in the website .
We had to <unk> some <unk> and so forth .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> . <unk> of these <unk> <unk> an image that <unk> an image that is actually discovered <unk> to this model .
So they &apos;re all <unk> <unk> and they &apos;ve all been <unk> on this way .
And it &apos;s possible to <unk> this <unk> way .
You know , I would never think of it to end up working for <unk> .
It &apos;s very <unk> to <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different kinds of <unk> : from the cell phones to those <unk> <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> number , <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I can <unk> them to be <unk> .
Many are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
<unk> here is a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from <unk> to <unk> to the physics of this environment .
The <unk> point is that we can do things with the social environment . This is now <unk> data from the whole <unk> memory of how the earth the earth is <unk> by <unk> and <unk> all those data together .
All those pictures become <unk> together , greater than the <unk> of the parts .
You have a model of the earth that <unk> .
Think about this as the <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> on Earth .
It &apos;s something that <unk> in complexity , as people <unk> it , and the <unk> for those who <unk> <unk> it with the use .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people .
If someone comes the idea of <unk> all of these <unk> <unk> , the <unk> picture , my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of those data , and I can use the as a <unk> <unk> to <unk> in that space , in that <unk> , using the pictures , using the pictures of anyone else , and have an experience of the <unk> .
But of course , a <unk> of all of that are <unk> extremely <unk> of every part of the land , <unk> not just by <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What &apos;s all of your software <unk> us to do is that at some point in the next few years , all the photographs <unk> from anyone in the world are almost <unk> <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is we &apos;re going to find out .
It &apos;s creating <unk> , if you want , in the images .
And it &apos;s doing it at the content of the images .
And it becomes very interesting if you think about <unk> information <unk> that a lot of these <unk> images .
As you make a research , you get a <unk> and the <unk> on the page , you get a <unk> and the text on the page has a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture <unk> all your pictures ?
So , the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really huge . It &apos;s a <unk> effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it &apos;s really incredible . <unk> .
<unk> : I &apos;m going to leave you very much .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is the <unk> that you can &apos;t live between those <unk> in the wind <unk> , and <unk> it in the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of plants .
<unk> to think that <unk> will be <unk> even beyond the <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , or in <unk> , <unk> still <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , and that idea that the <unk> of <unk> , and that idea that the world that we live in there in a sense , but it &apos;s just a model of reality , but it &apos;s just a model of reality ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , well , or evil , a lot of <unk> .
And of course , everybody was <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . Everybody <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We have to <unk> the death <unk> , so we don &apos;t <unk> if we were <unk> and <unk> --
We have an art .
What <unk> is the particular <unk> of the song , the <unk> of the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that matter is the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of <unk> .
He was my <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> <unk> , the mother <unk> .
All of these <unk> are <unk> that there are other ways of thinking about other ways of thinking about moving around the world .
And , if you <unk> a minute , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of the world as a <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and is important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> known as <unk> as <unk> as <unk> .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the total <unk> of all the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> in being from the human imagination , <unk> , <unk> in being from the human imagination .
<unk> is the <unk> <unk> of humanity .
It &apos;s the <unk> of what we can be , and of what we can be as a <unk> species .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , which 50 percent of all species has been or is on the <unk> of <unk> , because it &apos;s <unk> , or in the <unk> <unk> -- in the field of diversity -- and and not even at the <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> of <unk> diversity .
The <unk> of that is , of course , <unk> <unk> .
When you &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
One language is not just by a <unk> or a series of rules of <unk> .
One language is the <unk> of the spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of the <unk> that the <unk> of every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a <unk> , a thought , a thought , a <unk> of <unk> .
And the ones that <unk> , as we sit here in <unk> , at least half not <unk> in the <unk> of children .
They don &apos;t <unk> to children , which means that they &apos;re not <unk> something , which is already <unk> .
What &apos;s more <unk> than the <unk> of being <unk> by <unk> , of being the last <unk> , of being <unk> , not <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of someone in the world every two weeks : every two weeks of a <unk> <unk> , and he takes with himself in the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> .
And I know that anybody of you say , &quot; <unk> &apos;t that better ?
The world would not be a better place if we all the same language ? &quot; <unk> , then we all talk . <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> of a <unk> , which means you can &apos;t talk to her language .
I &apos;d like to make a <unk> trip through the <unk> --
And you have a little journey of the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we &apos;re <unk> .
Most of us <unk> that when I say , &quot; different ways of <unk> , &quot; I really want different ways of <unk> .
So , for example , this <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> that you can &apos;t <unk> the blue color from green because the <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , because the <unk> <unk> in the forest that <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; You have to <unk> a person who is talking a different language .
And it has been <unk> in the past <unk> , but <unk> is that in these <unk> where you &apos;re talking about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> nobody <unk> .
You can start listening and then you start talking about .
I was one of the most interesting <unk> that I &apos;ve lived with , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> contact with a <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;ve done <unk> from the <unk> <unk> that <unk> them in <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> had never seen anything .
They <unk> the <unk> pictures , they <unk> them to a form or a <unk> , and they didn &apos;t know nothing about , they <unk> that they <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with the <unk> .
But <unk> don &apos;t just <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> to them .
<unk> percent of <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We went to eight <unk> and we found two <unk> two cases of natural death . And when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was so <unk> that he &apos;s <unk> , and then they <unk> it . And then they <unk> it . <unk> <unk> . And then they <unk> it . They had a <unk> forest .
<unk> were able to recognize the animal that was <unk> by 40 <unk> and to <unk> the species .
<unk> the early &apos; <unk> , I was <unk> a really interesting task when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> between the <unk> society and the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> to make .
And to make sense of <unk> , I should have to understand the <unk> culture , and the <unk> isn &apos;t <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Very interesting .
If you were to <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the world , what would you like ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent is always <unk> out , thinking that <unk> Africa has no <unk> <unk> . But instead , you know , <unk> is not something else that the <unk> of these <unk> very <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
What makes interesting is <unk> is the <unk> <unk> between life and death .
So <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> of alive in a short <unk> becomes the <unk> .
That &apos;s why <unk> <unk> to say , &quot; <unk> <unk> go to <unk> to speak of God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re <unk> , it &apos;s the spirit that you , how do you <unk> ?
So you start to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> in the state of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . A rather strong <unk> of the power of the body on the <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk> .
I mean all the <unk> that I &apos;ve been the most <unk> <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> , <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> has never been <unk> by <unk> .
In <unk> , I &apos;ve been <unk> by a <unk> , but their <unk> is extraordinary <unk> .
<unk> are <unk> from <unk> to three or four years , and they live in a world that &apos;s made of <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> at the base of the <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> years of nine years from the way to <unk> the nine months of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of mother , now are <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
For that time , they &apos;re <unk> to the values of their society , values that they &apos;re <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or just the <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or for better to say <unk> <unk> .
And at the end of this incredible <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> out and for the first time in their <unk> , at the age of 18 , see an <unk> . And in that moment of <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> , everything that they &apos;ve learned in theory in the <unk> <unk> , everything they &apos;ve learned in the theory of <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
&quot; <unk> ? I &apos;m going to tell you .
It &apos;s <unk> . Now it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
They &apos;re called <unk> <unk> , and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re the <unk> of the world .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think about <unk> <unk> and <unk> environment , and the old <unk> story , and the old <unk> story of <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> concept in his <unk> , or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are closer to Earth .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by <unk> .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or in <unk> <unk> <unk> , but because of time and <unk> , have created a <unk> of Earth , not about the concept of <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> : the concept that the Earth can only live because it &apos;s <unk> from human <unk> .
What does that mean ?
I mean that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> the mountain is a <unk> <unk> that <unk> its <unk> will be a human being <unk> , and it will have a very different relationship with the mountain or that <unk> of <unk> that <unk> a mountain of <unk> that <unk> that <unk> a mountain is <unk> that <unk> a mountain of <unk> <unk> , to be <unk> .
<unk> is <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is <unk> is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
That has made me a human being different from my friends , who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you try to <unk> that these <unk> can create different reality , we could actually start to understand some of their <unk> <unk> . <unk> this <unk> .
I took this picture to <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes <unk> <unk> is not the <unk> potential of <unk> , but its <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> from two elements .
On one side , this <unk> <unk> <unk> that has a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> only <unk> has a <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit of the <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> with a <unk> of the family <unk> said <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you ever see the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> the <unk> that <unk> from a different kind of <unk> , <unk> it <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on for <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . <unk> &apos;t creates a <unk> of the <unk> . It doesn &apos;t make a <unk> of reality .
I often came to my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the &apos; <unk> in the &apos; <unk> .
In my <unk> , you can &apos;t <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you &apos;re not <unk> , you can &apos;t tell anybody to be <unk> . <unk> <unk> , but they can &apos;t be <unk> because they &apos;re <unk> by a <unk> that is obviously in the <unk> , because I &apos;m a <unk> that is <unk> by a <unk> that is <unk> .
It &apos;s possible to <unk> <unk> if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now , this is the <unk> that are <unk> in this <unk> are <unk> <unk> , the same kind of <unk> to <unk> the <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> <unk> of <unk> species , like these <unk> <unk> two <unk> don &apos;t like that , but that if you <unk> this way , they make a <unk> version that &apos;s <unk> . <unk> that if you <unk> in this way , they create a <unk> version that &apos;s <unk> .
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you go to the <unk> , we &apos;re going to <unk> , &quot; We &apos;re talking about . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the forest , which <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that the eyes <unk> in the same species .
If you were <unk> to their <unk> , &quot; I &apos;m going to <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , you don &apos;t know everything ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take the <unk> <unk> in a <unk> of the full and <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
And so , you don &apos;t get <unk> , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , &#91; the problem is that even those of us who have to the <unk> <unk> <unk> them , but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of history than our real world , and it <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , we didn &apos;t <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk> , but rather like the <unk> was where we were <unk> and we <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> diversity and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> diversity and <unk> . Now , the problem is not the change .
All the <unk> were <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> don &apos;t have <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> as they didn &apos;t have <unk> to be when they <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that <unk> <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s the power .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you look at the world , you would say that these are not <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> creatures and they &apos;re <unk> out of <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk> .
I would say you to <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that lived in the <unk> <unk> to a generation ago , and now you start to the <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> , where you can see the <unk> from the <unk> that seems <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that seems away from the <unk> that seems away from the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to the forest <unk> .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> .
If you go on the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the <unk> <unk> of the political <unk> .
As <unk> <unk> , <unk> physics of a <unk> , is <unk> to <unk> level , but <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> , not only is not just <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in some <unk> because of development is part of development <unk> .
And you can &apos;t understand the <unk> of <unk> until you go out of the beginning .
I <unk> <unk> miles from <unk> in the West China through the West <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only you get to <unk> , I realized what the behind .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people were <unk> by <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> at the <unk> <unk> .
That means that it has been <unk> at the time of Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and her <unk> was <unk> .
It was taken of <unk> in <unk> at the age of two <unk> under her <unk> because she could have been <unk> to live without having to live without .
The <unk> , which has done the same , was <unk> in <unk> .
One day he <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to work for seven years .
The pain of <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of <unk> is from <unk> present .
<unk> , all of the whole thing you &apos;re <unk> to a choice .
Do you want to live in the <unk> world or <unk> we want to <unk> the world <unk> of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died said that his largest <unk> was that , in our <unk> <unk> , in our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , not only <unk> the entire entire <unk> of human imagination to <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of thought , but one day we <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it &apos;s <unk> that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , which has given us <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , by <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , and we &apos;re talking about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has to <unk> 300 years .
That <unk> story , I didn &apos;t believe that we have the answers all of the challenges that <unk> <unk> in <unk> to come .
When you know , these <unk> <unk> of the world , what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> <unk> different <unk> .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all all <unk> the possibilities of being what we are : a <unk> species , which has to <unk> that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are great moments of <unk> moments .
I took this picture on the <unk> north of the island of <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> me , <unk> the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The government wasn &apos;t always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> <unk> , and in the <unk> <unk> , we <unk> them .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
The family , <unk> all of his life , <unk> all the <unk> away all of his <unk> .
You have to know that <unk> don &apos;t <unk> the cold , you <unk> it .
The <unk> <unk> were made of <unk> fish in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn &apos;t <unk> at night or from the <unk> that <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> away , it <unk> the <unk> in the skin of <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did I <unk> , she <unk> them by them by creating a <unk> .
He &apos;s <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk> , <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a <unk> , he <unk> a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> you &apos;re going to talk about nothing ?
<unk> <unk> the government <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of an area of bigger than the California and the <unk> <unk> together .
It &apos;s their new <unk> . It &apos;s called <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s all the <unk> resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> at least to those <unk> areas of the planet , <unk> that there is not at all .
For someone is home .
We have to <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the time . And for us all , the dreams of these children , become part of the <unk> <unk> of hope .
And finally , we &apos;re <unk> <unk> that <unk> never to anything .
I would say that the <unk> --
It &apos;s not <unk> , but we believe the stories can change the world , and perhaps we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our site is <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public places in places that are <unk> by which <unk> from how much <unk> have seen and , <unk> , once you have seen , <unk> the central <unk> : the world &apos;s <unk> in <unk> , the world &apos;s <unk> of <unk> in a <unk> world , and we have to find a <unk> <unk> .
where all the <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some of the things that I hope you have other <unk> , and you &apos;re already <unk> <unk> , in case , you don &apos;t <unk> them .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all the societies <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> : &quot; If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens . &quot; The way to do it is to <unk> freedom <unk> . &quot;
The reason is , on one side , in the fact that freedom is itself a value , is <unk> , useful , useful , useful for human beings .
On the other is that if we &apos;re <unk> , every one of us can act for it to do everything that <unk> our <unk> , without nobody <unk> in our <unk> .
The way to <unk> freedom is <unk> choice .
More choices , people have more <unk> , and more <unk> , and more they are the <unk> , the more <unk> .
This , <unk> , is so <unk> <unk> in society that nobody <unk> to <unk> in <unk> .
And it &apos;s also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I <unk> a simple note on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> <unk> you can buy a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that nobody is in the <unk> <unk> that nobody has already <unk> to <unk> .
That &apos;s what <unk> is .
Then you go to the <unk> <unk> <unk> to buy a <unk> : <unk> , radio , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there &apos;s a large number of <unk> <unk> .
We can make six million different and a half million different <unk> using <unk> that there are in one <unk> .
<unk> <unk> there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> fields : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the <unk> services , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , you don &apos;t <unk> it .
And a <unk> of that , by the way , was that the <unk> never <unk> .
These days have gone .
We have now a <unk> <unk> , especially in cell phones .
Here &apos;s cell phones .
My <unk> is in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
If you don &apos;t have that still <unk> in the house , you &apos;re very well <unk> that you &apos;re very soon <unk> .
And what happens at the end is that people <unk> in <unk> and ask this question . And you know what <unk> is the answer ? The answer is &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do anything .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : You don &apos;t see that in the United States you <unk> from <unk> and <unk> you have to do .
But instead , I <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> says , &quot; Okay , we can do A , or <unk> , &quot; A <unk> , &quot; he has these <unk> and these <unk> . &quot; He has these <unk> and these <unk> . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You said , &quot; You know , what would you do ? &quot;
And the <unk> says , &quot; He has these <unk> and these <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> and <unk> these <unk> . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; You know if you were me , what would you say ? &quot;
And the <unk> , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
And we call it <unk> <unk> , <unk> that makes it look like a <unk> .
But it &apos;s not that a <unk> the weight and the responsibility for making decisions by someone who knows something , <unk> <unk> , to someone else who doesn &apos;t know anything -- and it &apos;s <unk> -- and so you don &apos;t have to <unk> <unk> to make decisions , the patient decisions .
There &apos;s a huge <unk> of products , which is <unk> to people like me and you , that if you think does not make sense , because you cannot <unk> .
But if we can &apos;t <unk> , why would we <unk> them ?
The answer is , which they want to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , as a <unk> is our <unk> now is a question of choice , as you see in this <unk> . &quot; We don &apos;t want to <unk> kids .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
That means that every <unk> , at <unk> , you have to decide what kind of person want to be .
We went to the family and <unk> , a time perspective , the common <unk> , almost for anyone , had that <unk> the <unk> as soon as possible .
The only real choice was to who , not when , and not , what to do after .
<unk> , everything is really to play .
They &apos;re going to be very smart students , and they &apos;re going to be 20 percent in less work than a time .
And they &apos;re not because they &apos;re not <unk> , because they &apos;re not <unk> .
But why I &apos;m <unk> , I &apos;m <unk> to say , &quot; <unk> <unk> or not ? You want to do that now ? &quot;
&quot; Do you want to think about the <unk> ? I have to think before kids or <unk> ? &quot;
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this <unk> doesn &apos;t <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and get a <unk> <unk> to my <unk> .
And they really have to do that . I &apos;m important questions .
Now , the work is that we &apos;re <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> , because the technology allows us to work every minute , from the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> , and I &apos;m not going to say nobody to which the <unk> , where the <unk> works .
I don &apos;t tell you this , because I want to use it .
What does that mean , this incredible freedom we have about work ? It &apos;s that we have to decide , <unk> at all right time , if we &apos;re working or not .
We can go to see our son , <unk> in <unk> , with the <unk> in a <unk> , the <unk> , the other , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , on the <unk> .
And even though they &apos;re all <unk> , every minute that we see our <unk> child <unk> , we &apos;re also <unk> , &quot; I &apos;m going to answer this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to <unk> this <unk> ? I have to <unk> this letter ? I have to <unk> this letter ? I have to <unk> this letter ? I have to <unk> this letter ? I have to <unk> this letter ? I have to <unk> this letter ? I have to <unk> this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , that &apos;s all of the experience of your child &apos;s very different than what it would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the things , small and big , objects and <unk> life , life is a matter of choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but not everything was about choice .
The world of today is going to be <unk> to this : <unk> is , or is it ?
The answer is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about <unk> .
<unk> this <unk> two <unk> <unk> .
The first one , <unk> , is that <unk> instead of <unk> .
With a lot of <unk> that you have to choose , to be very difficult to do it .
I &apos;ll give you an example of <unk> : a <unk> study on <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> has had access to data from <unk> , the <unk> <unk> society , with about a million <unk> <unk> in <unk> in different companies .
What you &apos;ve discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> to the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> of two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s 10 percent in less than you can <unk> than when they &apos;re only <unk> . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> between them , it &apos;s hard to decide , and it &apos;s <unk> to decide .
And in <unk> , and still in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course <unk> never comes never .
<unk> that doesn &apos;t just mean that these are <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> because they don &apos;t have enough money , even to say that the decision is so <unk> that they also <unk> the <unk> <unk> of work .
They &apos;re not <unk> , until five <unk> <unk> <unk> per year from the work <unk> , which would be well <unk> to <unk> .
So <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices .
And I think we &apos;re going to <unk> the world like this .
&quot; And finally , for <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
They want to make the right decision , if it &apos;s for <unk> , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and you &apos;re going to have to choose the wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even though we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice , at the end is less by the result of how you have been <unk> by the <unk> of how you have been with less <unk> .
And that &apos;s for different reasons .
One of them is that with so many <unk> between you , if you <unk> one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine you could have a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> from decision , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> that decision , <unk> from the decision , the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> decision ,
even when it was a <unk> decision .
The more choices are , it &apos;s easier to <unk> than any <unk> that is <unk> of choice .
<unk> , there &apos;s one that <unk> call .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well known as the value that we give things <unk> from what <unk> .
<unk> , you know , when there are so many <unk> , it &apos;s easy to <unk> the <unk> <unk> and be less <unk> than the <unk> <unk> that you have choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;ll <unk> with all of the ones that are not New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably would probably know .
There &apos;s this <unk> to <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not going to be anything . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; All my <unk> are away . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> just in front of your home . &quot;
And it <unk> two weeks <unk> from the idea that &apos;s <unk> -- every day -- the <unk> of <unk> where he wants .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the most are the <unk> that we have from <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> up against how <unk> .
Here &apos;s another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It &apos;s about living the moment , and it &apos;s perhaps to live in the slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you <unk> , you &apos;re not going to be other .
The things that don &apos;t <unk> have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> point : <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a couple of <unk> .
They were almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were of one like , they were <unk> , and they were <unk> , they were <unk> , only after <unk> , they were <unk> , only after they had a lot of times , <unk> to go well .
So I went to <unk> a couple of new when the <unk> were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> said , &quot; You want to <unk> them , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
<unk> them wants to <unk> or <unk> ? &quot; <unk> &quot;
&quot; <unk> wants to <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> wants to <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a little bit of a little bit , I was able to say , &quot; I want the only guy . &quot; He had no idea what it was , so for an hour , I would all be <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then I &apos;d ever had .
It was the <unk> . With all that choice I had to do the best .
But I &apos;m going to get worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to <unk> .
And the reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I was <unk> <unk> . I didn &apos;t <unk> anything to me when I was just one like , but when I was going to spend 100 different , <unk> , at least one of being perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
And after I was <unk> to what I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in life of people don &apos;t <unk> the <unk> that these have respect to the <unk> that these have <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> .
And that &apos;s <unk> less <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of <unk> , it makes it <unk> .
Because if I <unk> it , I don &apos;t understand what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more to that .
&quot; He was better when he was worse was worse , &quot; The reason he was better when he was worse was <unk> possible to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , the world that we live in -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things at the <unk> of <unk> .
You &apos;ve never <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; Yeah , you want it . &quot;
I mean -- small <unk> moment -- that I &apos;m really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I could have done better , I didn &apos;t have <unk> .
But <unk> is not always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> , a couple of <unk> <unk> when there is only that you have that <unk> is that when you don &apos;t <unk> , and I &apos;m going to tell you &quot; Why ? &quot;
Who is it <unk> ? &quot; The answer is <unk> .
The world is <unk> . What could I do this ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of <unk> , and you get a <unk> , and you &apos;re going to <unk> who is <unk> , it <unk> , it &apos;s clear that the <unk> you are .
They could do better .
With hundreds of <unk> , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even though the result , even though the <unk> is <unk> and give them to them themselves .
In the last few years , <unk> is <unk> in the world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only <unk> , but important -- of this <unk> <unk> is that people have experiences because the <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation , they think that <unk> is their .
So the final result is that in general we &apos;re better , but we &apos;re <unk> worse .
Let me show you .
This is <unk> <unk> , what we all get for good and is completely <unk> . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than not <unk> at all , but from this is not <unk> that much choice .
There &apos;s a <unk> value , <unk> . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve <unk> from a piece of the level that the choices that <unk> our lives .
Now , from a <unk> point of view -- I almost finished -- from a <unk> point of view , <unk> is the <unk> .
And that allows all this choice in <unk> society is <unk> .
There are many places in the world , and you have <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that they have choice .
The problem is they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I &apos;m talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does <unk> is : <unk> <unk> has talked about yesterday about how <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> are <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> of money .
I mean these choices , <unk> and <unk> , it &apos;s not just <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
We have to be worse .
If some of what we do in our <unk> <unk> , it was <unk> in those where people have too few possibilities , not just as much possibility , it would not only be their lives to <unk> , but also our own .
That &apos;s what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income is good at all -- not just the poor people -- not just because of this choice in <unk> in <unk> .
And to <unk> , &quot; <unk> , you can become everything you want ,
<unk> , people of culture , I said , &quot; But what do you know that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s <unk> you can &apos;t do anything in a glass <unk> . &quot;
&quot; A <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and I <unk> it , I <unk> it like this , at the beginning .
But then , I realized , instead , I realized that that fish knows that that fish knows long .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you <unk> in <unk> , so that &quot; everything is possible . &quot; You can &apos;t <unk> freedom . You <unk> the <unk> . &quot;
If you <unk> the <unk> so that you can <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
They all need a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
