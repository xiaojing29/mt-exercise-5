<unk> year I showed this <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for nearly three million years has been <unk> the United States , is <unk> 40 percent .
We <unk> this <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it &apos;s not showing the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a way , the heart of the global climate system .
They <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You can see , it <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That &apos;s the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> in summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , of five years , more like the blood , which here is <unk> from the body .
In 25 years it was such a way .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> around the <unk> of <unk> , where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> , are <unk> in <unk> from the <unk> .
We <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> from global <unk> , that amount of <unk> , <unk> this point not <unk> .
In some <unk> , you know , <unk> <unk> <unk> is already <unk> by water .
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> was <unk> with a <unk> <unk> last <unk> team .
<unk> : <unk> ! Al <unk> : She &apos;s fine . The question is if we <unk> it .
One is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the north .
This is a river in <unk> .
<unk> had never <unk> like that .
This is the <unk> river , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how to <unk> goes down the sea level on <unk> , here is where the sea is going to be .
These <unk> are <unk> .
<unk> on the planet : <unk> , the largest <unk> of ice on the planet .
<unk> month scientists have <unk> that the ice <unk> is in <unk> , and that the Western <unk> , which <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> at six feet of <unk> , like <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the largest third largest <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which few years ago were <unk> .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population <unk> water from that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : This <unk> is the source of <unk> water of this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same happens to <unk> water .
In California , <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of 40 percent .
<unk> <unk> are in crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they &apos;re <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the world leads to a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of normal and <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years , on the <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the whole <unk> .
If you look at it in the <unk> context , you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we &apos;ve <unk> million <unk> of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the oceans every day .
Look at <unk> area of the <unk> <unk> , from <unk> , to <unk> , and on both of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where there is a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean .
The greater cause of the global warming , together to <unk> , which is 20 percent of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of two countries with more emissions with China .
And you can build a lot of other <unk> .
But we &apos;re starting a <unk> of the direction .
These are the projects that are <unk> in the last few years and some <unk> of <unk> .
Every way , there is a political <unk> in our country .
The <unk> of <unk> and oil have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I <unk> image , I <unk> something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it on the <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> of <unk> in America .
It &apos;s been successful around <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> <unk> is a <unk> and happy .
It &apos;s been here in America , and it &apos;s growing our economy .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Al <unk> : From here , this is a big <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
The largest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> clear -- Al <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- not know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al <unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , a part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> , we see the <unk> changes like a <unk> <unk> to our business .
So , we have a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public and <unk> the truth to <unk> .
It &apos;s not <unk> .
We think it &apos;s <unk> -- it &apos;s also a good <unk> .
So , we don &apos;t have to <unk> of climate change .
We can do it .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you &apos;ve heard that a lot of them .
So we <unk> a turn to a <unk> structure , as it is about <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> are a little bit <unk> , but that &apos;s the sound of <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> is between the <unk> of global warming , but the <unk> technology of <unk> that you see is changing everything .
Let &apos;s look at this : this is the <unk> technology of <unk> .
Al <unk> : <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic and the national security .
<unk> : <unk> , America is in the crisis ; the economy , the national security crisis .
The <unk> that all the <unk> of : our <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and <unk> .
Now , there &apos;s a new way , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A <unk> for <unk> America to work , <unk> more <unk> , and help <unk> the global <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we can solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
Al <unk> : This is the last .
<unk> : This is <unk> energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> end from the <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , a new network .
<unk> <unk> 2 : <unk> <unk> for jobs .
<unk> : <unk> America . It &apos;s time to be <unk> .
Al <unk> : A <unk> <unk> says , &quot; If you want to go , go alone .
If you want to go far , go together , go together . &quot;
We have to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED I made a <unk> on <unk> .
And I &apos;m trying to <unk> to <unk> about how the machine works .
So I got to here . And for the ones that were there , the <unk> is the largest experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
<unk> is to <unk> the conditions that were present less than a <unk> of the second beginning of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second .
And all of that is just <unk> .
This is the <unk> machine .
They <unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk> .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> feet , and it &apos;s <unk> feet .
This is a <unk> image of <unk> in construction . And so you can see the <unk> .
<unk> 10 <unk> last year we <unk> the car for the first time .
And this photograph was <unk> by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> of particles that she had done all the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles inside the <unk> .
In other words , when you <unk> that image , the 10 <unk> , you know that the <unk> machine , which is a great <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if that was that <unk> us more or this , when someone <unk> on Google and they would <unk> that the <unk> page was this .
That means we have had a <unk> impact on the scientific .
And I was a week later , there was a problem with the car , had to be these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> of <unk> .
Now , the <unk> of you <unk> and <unk> , &quot; It &apos;s not true . I &apos;m <unk> too <unk> . &quot;
And they can do that because when they &apos;re very <unk> to become the <unk> <unk> .
So , at less <unk> degrees , at a temperature <unk> to that of the space between stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> an electric <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and that are <unk> about 30 <unk> .
They have about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , which we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
They &apos;re now <unk> everybody in their <unk> place .
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> is going to be new <unk> .
We <unk> it , and we &apos;ll try to get <unk> data or <unk> , and so our <unk> to find out what the <unk> are <unk> that <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> the value of science and engineering of <unk> engineering . It &apos;s easy to <unk> .
I think it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s so hard , I think that &apos;s the value of things like <unk> .
I &apos;d like to end with a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who , <unk> , <unk> , in <unk> of <unk> experiments of his <unk> , his <unk> was Michael <unk> , said , &quot; No <unk> that <unk> for human mind how the science of science is <unk> , that our <unk> are <unk> , that our <unk> are <unk> , and that are not <unk> in nature , that our <unk> are <unk> , and that are not <unk> by <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> with <unk> when , as children , <unk> with <unk> .
And as we were <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , we actually began to think and <unk> problems and solve <unk> problems .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way most of the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects , with my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started to say , &quot; And if , when we use a computer , instead of having the only <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> on a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> that <unk> on a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> of information with both with both hands ,
and how about our <unk> ?
And the question was so interesting that I decided that I was <unk> the answer , to <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as big as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as big as a <unk> .
You can <unk> it with your hand , you can <unk> with them , and feel their own movement and they have a screen and they have a screen .
But <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> .
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> the digital information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement , <unk> of the movement , other , and as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement , and to <unk> them , we can explore new <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
Let &apos;s start with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show : if you <unk> it in one direction , the <unk> video , the <unk> video like this , if we were to the other side back .
These <unk> are <unk> of other people .
If you <unk> them , they &apos;re <unk> to what it is ,
If they <unk> , they <unk> it and they can <unk> it a little bit .
If they <unk> , they <unk> it and they can <unk> it a little bit .
They also <unk> the movement and <unk> .
We then realized that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> was the <unk> that you can use common on data , for example , like a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> I can <unk> it to <unk> the <unk> of color in that central , where they <unk> .
and I can <unk> it to <unk> color in that central color , where you <unk> .
And if you <unk> too much , we can <unk> a little bit of a <unk> .
There are also <unk> possibilities of <unk> , like <unk> , <unk> , math and <unk> where people can try things quickly , and they <unk> things immediately .
I &apos;m now --
This is a sequence of <unk> I &apos;m doing with a <unk> program .
Here we have a game of words that is in half between <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at any <unk> <unk> a letter in <unk> , <unk> , at every <unk> , at every <unk> , and <unk> a letter <unk> to <unk> , and as we were <unk> in the <unk> words on a <unk> .
And then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try and .
Thank you .
There are <unk> children in <unk> to the <unk> <unk> , I did so that I <unk> them and I <unk> a video .
They &apos;re very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things like this <unk> is that you don &apos;t have to <unk> people .
I just wanted to say , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , and on the right .
It actually wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
He had to build a tool for <unk> of <unk> . He &apos;s <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So , it &apos;s <unk> the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now he brought a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> work ! Yeah !
So , we <unk> and <unk> <unk> can make the characters ,
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with open final , and it can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with open final , and it can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time to show you is a tool that made , and I recently did , to <unk> and <unk> music .
It &apos;s a tool that we did , to <unk> and <unk> music .
<unk> here we <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> , low and <unk> .
<unk> of these has four different <unk> , and you can choose which to use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence sequence from <unk> to your <unk> .
And they just <unk> <unk> a sound and a sequence sequence .
These are actually <unk> that you can control live , like <unk> and <unk> .
We &apos;ll start to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are <unk> effects as time and <unk> , who <unk> to the whole sequence .
<unk> how it works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> one <unk> <unk> , <unk> a <unk> sequence , <unk> in a series , <unk> , <unk> .
Now , we &apos;re going to <unk> a <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : Now let &apos;s <unk> --
<unk> : And I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> to the <unk> , so I can control the effect of alive .
<unk> : I can <unk> the whole sequence of time from one side or the other .
<unk> : And now we &apos;ll <unk> the <unk> <unk> to give <unk> .
<unk> : I can <unk> the <unk> &quot; at the <unk> . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to tell you about it before , but I can <unk> it , <unk> long , <unk> or more <unk> .
And now , finally I can <unk> the whole sequence on the left the whole <unk> on the left <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> , how our brain works , and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
And the concept that I want to <unk> is that it &apos;s <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> with the media <unk> , which <unk> information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time I &apos;m going to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and <unk> of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like that .
But , by that , something particular happened in my life and in my life , which led me to <unk> the whole relationship to <unk> the whole relationship with this job .
The particular thing is I wrote this book , this <unk> called &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which , <unk> from my books , for some <unk> reason in the world and <unk> a big <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that <unk> everywhere I go , people like I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I &apos;m going to go to me and say , &quot; Do you have no fear of you not to be able to do better ?
Do you have to <unk> writing about all life without being able to create a book that can <unk> someone to be able to create a book that can help someone ? &quot;
what can happen to someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , except I remember that I remember over the years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
I <unk> to the same <unk> <unk> from fear .
And people said , &quot; Do you know you don &apos;t know that they <unk> ?
Do you have no fear <unk> <unk> you ?
Do you have to <unk> this <unk> all of life without anything that ever anything has ever come out and die on a <unk> of <unk> dreams with the mouth of <unk> <unk> <unk> &apos;s mouth ?
So , you know .
The short answer to -- the short answer to all of questions is , they are . &quot;
Yeah , I fear of all those things .
I &apos;ve always been afraid .
And I &apos;m also afraid of many other things that people can &apos;t <unk> .
Like <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as I &apos;m going to write that , and I thought , you know , &quot; What &apos;s why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It &apos;s <unk> that anybody who <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel to do .
But what is so particular about <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> to <unk> health <unk> in a way that other <unk> , they don &apos;t do ?
How did my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> , and I don &apos;t remember one time in his <unk> <unk> when he was asked if he was <unk> <unk> ?
There was never -- that <unk> of the <unk> John , how did it go ?
Do you know that , <unk> ?
<unk> , the engineers <unk> like <unk> have no certainly , in <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
We have enough , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> but <unk> like all , we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk> .
And so , nothing else that look at the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , young and often as they .
And those who are not <unk> seem to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before he died , in the last <unk> said , &quot; Every my book me <unk> a little more <unk> . &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; And he was a little bit more <unk> about the work of their life .
But we didn &apos;t know <unk> when I knew that because we heard that because we heard so long and we &apos;ve got completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and creativity <unk> in some way <unk> and that art , at the end , <unk> , it always <unk> to the <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> to everybody here is : you agree with this idea ?
You &apos;re fine -- because it &apos;s also <unk> from a <unk> distance to me not .
I think it &apos;s <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s also <unk> , and I don &apos;t want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better <unk> our <unk> <unk> to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start to that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> that I &apos;m in my career .
<unk> -- look , I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;m about 40 years .
I still have about four <unk> of work in me .
And it &apos;s very <unk> that anything you know what &apos;s going to happen in the world as the work that <unk> after my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we &apos;re all about friends here -- is <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> thought !
You know , the kind of thought that leads to a person to start <unk> at nine <unk> in the morning , and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so , it seems to me , after many <unk> , that the way to work on and create a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to have to find a <unk> distance between me , which I &apos;m <unk> , and my natural <unk> that <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> that <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> . And as I was <unk> for all last year , trying to find other societies to see if you have to have better ideas and more <unk> than
how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research led me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s because it &apos;s going to be <unk> and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don &apos;t believe that creativity <unk> from men , OK ?
It turns out that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and that <unk> to men in the <unk> from some <unk> and <unk> , for reasons .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity . <unk> <unk> of creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
The <unk> were the same idea , but they <unk> that sort of spirit without a <unk> body .
which is <unk> , because the <unk> don &apos;t really know that a <unk> was particularly smart ,
And I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> literally <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> out of <unk> <unk> , and <unk> out of <unk> the <unk> of the artist and <unk> the <unk> of that work .
<unk> <unk> , that &apos;s the distance I &apos;m talking to -- that <unk> <unk> you <unk> from your <unk> results .
And everybody <unk> that was so <unk> , right ?
So the <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like too <unk> , right ?
If your work was <unk> you don &apos;t have to <unk> the <unk> , you all know that you have been <unk> from this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it &apos;s not all of your <unk> , right ?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
And then the <unk> <unk> and everything , and we <unk> this great idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe on top and <unk> and no longer to leave space on the <unk> .
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people started to think that creativity was completely <unk> by <unk> .
And for the first time in history , you start <unk> to this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think that &apos;s going to be a simple person to believe that they &apos;re like a <unk> like the source , the source , and the <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a responsibility to <unk> a <unk> too big to <unk> human <unk> .
It &apos;s like to someone to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> the <unk> and creates all of these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think that has been <unk> to have <unk> artists in the 500 years .
And , if that &apos;s true , and I think it becomes , the question becomes , and now
Can we do that ?
<unk> <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t do it spend 500 years old thinking in a <unk> talk .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience who are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of , <unk> , do that <unk> people will <unk> <unk> to their projects .
You probably won &apos;t all <unk> on this .
But the question I want to <unk> is -- why not ?
Why not we do this ?
Because more sense of everything I &apos;ve ever heard about to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process .
A process that , as anyone who ever has to do something -- so , basically , you know , you don &apos;t know <unk> .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seem completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s now 90 years , but who was a <unk> for the whole life and said that during his <unk> <unk> , he was <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> , and I <unk> it , inside the <unk> , and I <unk> it , in the <unk> <unk> .
And he said , he was like a <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> to her <unk> to her from the <unk> .
We <unk> it to get there , because it <unk> the land under his feet .
I decided to have one thing to do , and that was , words , &quot; <unk> as a <unk> . &quot;
And so I went back to the home and came from this <unk> , and he wouldn &apos;t have anything else to take a piece of paper and a <unk> <unk> enough to the next page .
<unk> times you can &apos;t be enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> them to get to home and <unk> her <unk> , and she would <unk> her <unk> , and she would <unk> it to <unk> , looking for , like she said , &quot; another <unk> . &quot;
And then there were times -- this piece of piece , I never <unk> -- there were times when the <unk> was almost <unk> , right ?
So , he was coming back at home and he was looking for paper and <unk> them through , and he <unk> a <unk> just in the <unk> , and then he said , that he was like <unk> with the other hand and <unk> .
It <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> in his body and <unk> it into his body and <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the page , and <unk> , but <unk> , from the last word to the first word .
So when I <unk> <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not all my <unk> process -- I &apos;m not a <unk> !
I &apos;m a <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;m <unk> to the same <unk> every day and work and <unk> and <unk> to work and <unk> above <unk> .
But even I , in my <unk> , I &apos;ve <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I thought that &apos;s a lot of you will do .
You know , even though the work and ideas I <unk> from a certain source I can &apos;t <unk> <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> to it in a way to <unk> our head , but rather , how do we <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
As far as I think , the best example , which I &apos;ve <unk> is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;ve <unk> several years ago for a <unk> .
I &apos;m talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> artist , looking at these <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> these species of <unk> totally <unk> .
But then he <unk> , he <unk> , and he was <unk> on a day when he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , <unk> it .
<unk> , and everything is a <unk> <unk> , this little <unk> of <unk> , who comes in his head like <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , you know , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , but not know how to <unk> .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it &apos;s not a <unk> , it has no <unk> .
So it starts to feel this kind of old <unk> , <unk> , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to <unk> and <unk> <unk> by this <unk> song .
I &apos;m not <unk> enough , and I can &apos;t <unk> . &quot;
And instead of going to the <unk> , they <unk> .
It <unk> the whole process and made something completely new .
He just got the <unk> and said , &quot; <unk> , do you see I &apos;m <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Do you think it can write a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you know , <unk> a more <unk> when I can take care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> more .
<unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And his process <unk> <unk> after that .
It wasn &apos;t working , it was a job that &apos;s always <unk> .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that outside him <unk> , the <unk> that he <unk> the other problems and <unk> it back from where it was , you know , that it was not to be an <unk> thing and <unk> .
but I was <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> <unk> a conversation with <unk> and this thing that <unk> , but it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
So how much that story I <unk> to change a little bit , even the way I <unk> and I &apos;m going to <unk> a time .
This idea , I &apos;m <unk> when I was <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; and I <unk> it into one of those <unk> <unk> in which we <unk> all when we &apos;re working on something , and you start to think that will be a <unk> , which will be the book that will be the <unk> book .
Not only <unk> , the <unk> book .
And we started thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I decided to <unk> that I was <unk> to the air and <unk> .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I said , &quot; <unk> , what , we know , we know that if this book is not going to be <unk> <unk> , my ?
Because you see I &apos;m <unk> all I have , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t , you know what , I don &apos;t do anything .
I started writing the same because it &apos;s my job .
And I &apos;d like to take you to be <unk> that I &apos;ve been <unk> to do my own part . &quot; Because at the end of Africa , &quot; OK , <unk> it does in the <unk> of Africa , they &apos;re <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> for the <unk> for the <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every once and <unk> , <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> in <unk> .
And I know you know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you &apos;ve all seen , at some point , a <unk> like this .
It was like time , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it was not doing anything different from the <unk> , like <unk> <unk> <unk> first , but it was all <unk> .
And suddenly it doesn &apos;t <unk> to <unk> as a human just .
But it <unk> up from <unk> and <unk> in the fire of the <unk> .
And when this <unk> , in the time , people <unk> what was , they <unk> it with his name .
<unk> hands and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , they <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; to &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; to &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which is still you can hear in the <unk> or in the <unk> .
In <unk> , when an artist did something impossible to <unk> and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it &apos;s <unk> because we need it .
But the problem comes the next day , the problem comes the next day , when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s no longer there .
It &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> with a big <unk> to the <unk> , and maybe it never <unk> to the <unk> <unk> .
And maybe nobody is <unk> the name of God again as we go , and what does it have to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so <unk> if you can &apos;t believe , <unk> , <unk> , that the most <unk> <unk> of your being come from yourself .
But just <unk> you that are data in <unk> from a <unk> of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to another <unk> when you &apos;re finished .
And , you know , if we think it in this way , it all changes .
And so I started <unk> , and it &apos;s like I <unk> it for several months in the book that I was <unk> soon , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of my <unk> success .
And what I have to keep <unk> when I feel <unk> from that is , I &apos;m not afraid .
Don &apos;t <unk> . You just have your job .
You can <unk> it for your <unk> , whatever it can be .
If you have a <unk> , you know .
If the <unk> , you will be <unk> <unk> to you <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for one moment through your <unk> , then <unk> !
<unk> , you do the same <unk> .
And &quot; <unk> ! &quot; to you do that .
I think it &apos;s <unk> and I think it &apos;s <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; to you do that , even for <unk> love human and <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know I &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects about human genome , what it can <unk> and discovery about what it can <unk> and about new genes of genes .
We &apos;re now <unk> a new path we started to start <unk> biology and now starting from that digital code we &apos;re <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , and <unk> life .
We &apos;ve been trying to get <unk> questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many <unk> I think have <unk> to understand different levels .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> for almost 20 years now .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go from the <unk> world of the <unk> of the computer biology to the digital world .
Now , can we <unk> the life , or is to create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> genome from the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> a more small one .
We can <unk> a <unk> of <unk> of about 500 genes that are here .
But when we look at his <unk> map , it &apos;s <unk> simple than our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at a time , it &apos;s very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell .
So I thought that the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> in a way to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of &quot; Can we <unk> a <unk> ? &quot;
Can the chemistry <unk> to produce these big molecules that we &apos;ve never done before ?
And , in case , can we make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The speed with which we &apos;re able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> .
Our ability to write the code , instead , <unk> slowly , but it &apos;s <unk> .
And our <unk> results that have <unk> on a <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve been <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before .
But we &apos;ve discovered that <unk> of DNA is very hard .
There are <unk> of thousands of <unk> in the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA , of 30 to 50 <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> process : the more <unk> is , the longer there are .
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , <unk> from information digital information , <unk> genome of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a little virus that <unk> bacteria .
We designed <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part of it is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> it in bacteria , they <unk> this <unk> , and to <unk> the <unk> particles .
<unk> particles have been there with cells , they have <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I talked about the <unk> industry that they &apos;ve been <unk> with the <unk> industry that they &apos;ve certainly <unk> this model .
They <unk> more than you .
I think this is a situation where the software actually can build its own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we had to do the bigger things .
You had to build the entire <unk> of the <unk> .
They are more than <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> code .
So we thought we &apos;d <unk> in <unk> of the <unk> , so that we can change the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> information with <unk> information in a computer , these have to be very <unk> .
When we did this genome for the first time in <unk> , the standard <unk> was of a <unk> <unk> for every 10 <unk> .
We &apos;ve discovered , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If we were to use that original sequence never <unk> states to do it .
A process is going to design is <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of the process of <unk> to build <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> elements here .
You probably read that you have read that you &apos;re probably going to read that you &apos;re probably <unk> .
So , we have a <unk> code for four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk>
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together about 20 <unk> , and there &apos;s a <unk> order to <unk> for each <unk> .
So we can use the <unk> code for writing , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did was , what we did was .
Some of them have been <unk> by the fact that it &apos;s not <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started <unk> parts , <unk> with <unk> <unk> from five to seven <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> at 24 <unk> <unk> <unk> at them <unk> <unk> .
<unk> we have produced these <unk> in <unk> so that we &apos;re <unk> to create an extremely <unk> <unk> <unk> as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to <unk> the process .
So , this seems like a <unk> <unk> .
When we started these <unk> <unk> , more than 100 <unk> <unk> , no longer <unk> into the <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> tools of <unk> biology .
So we have to <unk> more .
<unk> another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA that &apos;s able to <unk> the <unk> .
Here &apos;s an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> like his <unk> is <unk> .
In 12 hours , they &apos;re <unk> exactly like it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely <unk> .
We should live under <unk> .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and it &apos;s <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
Actually , NASA , showed that this happens .
This is a picture of the <unk> we built up these <unk> , just using <unk> with the <unk> design <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s such a big <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we did a little bit of time ago .
They are more than <unk> <unk> of <unk> code .
It &apos;s the largest <unk> of a <unk> structure ever <unk> by man .
It has a <unk> weight over 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a 10 <unk> without <unk> , you &apos;d just <unk> pages to <unk> this code .
Now , how do we make it work ? How can we <unk> it ?
Of course , through a virus is a <unk> game .
It &apos;s a little more <unk> when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s easier even when it comes to <unk> cells like <unk> : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the <unk> process .
In <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> , you <unk> it is in the cell , but we have <unk> <unk> that we are able to do a <unk> <unk> from a cell to another and of <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> species .
The two are different than men .
We &apos;ve <unk> some <unk> <unk> in a way that you could decide what you &apos;ve got to choose what to do to choose what you might decide to what you &apos;re going to do to have a little bit more <unk> that we &apos;ve got to decide to decide to decide what this <unk> to choose what you might decide to choose what you &apos;re going to choose .
And then he <unk> it <unk> with the <unk> so that they <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell is <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> . The new <unk> <unk> went into the cell .
And we had to <unk> that we didn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to <unk> more .
This is one of the biggest <unk> of evolution .
We &apos;ve discovered that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So those people think about evolution as one <unk> at a time you <unk> not <unk> .
We <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> that we <unk> DNA .
The <unk> that was in the cell didn &apos;t <unk> one .
The <unk> <unk> we have <unk> it .
It <unk> , and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material , it <unk> , and we <unk> it , and we <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk> .
has become blue because of the genes that we &apos;ve <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all of the <unk> of a species went to the <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> of all in a new species , <unk> on the software that we &apos;ve <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , and the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the <unk> code exactly exactly what we &apos;ve <unk> .
Now , this may seem <unk> , but <unk> the software DNA we can change things in a <unk> way .
Now , I &apos;ve already <unk> that you &apos;re not talking about <unk> -- but of progress from three million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create new <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> new species on this digital process that <unk> <unk> new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> when we think of our <unk> .
We &apos;re going to go from six and a half billion people over the next 40 years .
Just to give you an example : I was born in <unk> .
Now , there are three people on the planet to <unk> in <unk> ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re <unk> problems now to find food , water <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , six and a half billion people .
We &apos;re going to have to do that for nine billion .
We &apos;re going to <unk> over five billion <unk> , over 30 billion <unk> of <unk> .
That means 100 million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process to <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
In more we have to realize that all of the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
<unk> of today , because of the <unk> <unk> all over the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that &apos;s the <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry <unk> only one <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here is <unk> data , <unk> and our imagination .
We now have <unk> , because of these <unk> <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think of <unk> these 20 million genes of different genes , or <unk> to <unk> <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> , chemical production or chemistry or <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software that we &apos;re working on to be able to <unk> and design species to do it and design to the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how to be .
We know exactly what their <unk> code .
We &apos;re <unk> now on the <unk> of <unk> generation .
You saw you that <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> <unk> and third generation that will be quite soon <unk> from <unk> to <unk> more value than the <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a very <unk> <unk> impact the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would <unk> the CO2 before we &apos;re working on to design that purpose , and we think we can have the first <unk> of <unk> to <unk> this purpose , and we think we can have the first generation of <unk> of <unk> 18 months .
<unk> solar <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> in our <unk> around the world , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> we <unk> in <unk> .
It &apos;s going to be in the deep ocean , about <unk> meters <unk> to water .
We &apos;re <unk> by using hydrogen <unk> as energy as energy as .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2 , that can easily be <unk> through <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So <unk> we think we might be able to <unk> what we might be able to <unk> what the basic question of life is , &quot; We , <unk> we have the <unk> goal for the whole <unk> industry .
<unk> . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can &apos;t you ?
We have a <unk> of energy .
And we also work on using the same <unk> to use the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk> .
You saw this year with flu , we &apos;re always <unk> a year and a dollar less <unk> , less to <unk> the right <unk> .
I think that you can change building <unk> in <unk> .
So , this is how the future can begin to look at <unk> , the tree of evolution , <unk> the evolution of <unk> , <unk> , and finally cells .
We are so far from <unk> people .
Our purpose is to make a way to live long enough to try to <unk> it . Thank you very much .
First of all , I &apos;m going to show you , the <unk> possible , some fundamental work , the new technology we &apos;ve brought to <unk> to a <unk> <unk> , almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
It &apos;s a environment in which you can <unk> is local level that you can <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> data .
We &apos;re seeing here <unk> of <unk> photos with a <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> images like we want .
And it &apos;s not that matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big the amount of data or the images .
Most of them are common photographs , but this is a <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of <unk> , and they <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any time . It &apos;s also very <unk> architecture .
This is a book whole , which is not images .
This is <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
So , you know , this is the <unk> and not of images , we can do something like that , to actually see that it &apos;s a real <unk> of the text , not a picture .
It could be a way to read a little bit of a <unk> ,
You don &apos;t know .
This is a more <unk> . This is a more <unk> example .
Every image of a big , it &apos;s the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the real <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of The <unk> .
We &apos;ve created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much higher than the one that uses in a normal <unk> , and we &apos;ve <unk> to you in the <unk> content .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even the <unk> <unk> .
And that really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
We think that this is going to put together to the <unk> and other <unk> like that , you don &apos;t have to be <unk> .
Of course , <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this not to lose time , if we don &apos;t want to lose , to say we have <unk> to give in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> over a NASA <unk> .
So now we &apos;re going to start something else .
This is actually live on the Web ; you can see it .
This is a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> student of <unk> <unk> , a <unk> student of Washington , with <unk> <unk> help from <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s live on the web , <unk> <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of experience <unk> experience .
But the <unk> <unk> of images here actually has a meaning .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> of the computer <unk> , and the way that <unk> <unk> to the <unk> places where the <unk> are <unk> <unk> . And here &apos;s the <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk> . Here you see the elements of a <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> , and these things were all <unk> to the <unk> level .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of <unk> data and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> that we &apos;ve done for the first summer <unk> to show what <unk> is really the key to you that <unk> is really the key to you that <unk> is really the key to this technology , the <unk> technology .
We had to <unk> <unk> and so forth .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> images from <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of types of kinds of <unk> and so forth . <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> an image that has been discovery <unk> to this model .
So they &apos;re all <unk> images and have all <unk> in this way .
And you can <unk> this way .
You know , I would never thought I &apos;d ever thought to <unk> .
It &apos;s very <unk> to <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of <unk> : that &apos;s cell phones : that &apos;s <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> number , <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I can look for those <unk> .
A lot of them are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
<unk> you &apos;re going to be a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from <unk> to <unk> physics .
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now <unk> data from the whole <unk> memory of how to <unk> the land , from the whole <unk> <unk> of how to <unk> the land , from the <unk> point of view and <unk> all that data .
All of those pictures become <unk> together , greater of the <unk> .
You have a model of the entire <unk> .
Think of it as the <unk> of <unk> &apos;s work on Earth .
It &apos;s something that <unk> in <unk> complexity that people <unk> it , and the <unk> for the people who are <unk> it with <unk> .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people .
If someone is a idea of <unk> all of <unk> , they <unk> the name , my <unk> <unk> <unk> , they <unk> all those data , and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> to <unk> in that space , in that <unk> , using the pictures , and to have a experience of social kind of <unk> and <unk> .
Now , a <unk> of all this is <unk> <unk> <unk> of every part of the land , and it &apos;s not just as <unk> <unk> and <unk> images and <unk> <unk> , but from the <unk> memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized what your software will <unk> us do is that at some point , in the next few years , all the photographs that in the entire world , will be <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> : Yeah . What it &apos;s doing is we find out .
It &apos;s creating <unk> , if you want , in images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the <unk> content .
And it becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> of <unk> information that a lot of these <unk> images .
As you <unk> a research on images , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the web has a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture you take all your pictures ?
So the amount of <unk> and <unk> <unk> that <unk> is really enormous . It &apos;s a <unk> effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it &apos;s really amazing . <unk> .
<unk> : I &apos;m going to <unk> you a lot .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is the <unk> that you can live between who doesn &apos;t <unk> the <unk> <unk> , between the wind <unk> it in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> it in the <unk> <unk> of plants .
You might think that <unk> will be <unk> even beyond the <unk> <unk> , or that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , or that in <unk> , the <unk> still <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , and that the idea that the world that we live in there is no <unk> , but it &apos;s only a model of reality ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> did , good or bad , a lot of <unk> is .
And of course , we all have <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . Everybody <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We have to <unk> the <unk> of death , so we don &apos;t know if we were and <unk> --
We all have an art .
What <unk> is the particular <unk> of the song , the <unk> of the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that matter is the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of <unk> .
He was my <unk> of the journey in the <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , on <unk> , the mother <unk> &apos;s mother &apos;s <unk> .
All of these <unk> are <unk> that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And if you <unk> a second , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of the world create a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and <unk> that <unk> the planet , as the <unk> <unk> known as <unk> as <unk> as <unk> as <unk> .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the <unk> of all of the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being from human imagination , by the human imagination , by <unk> of consciousness .
<unk> is the <unk> <unk> of humanity .
It &apos;s the <unk> of what we can be , and what we can be as <unk> species .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was successful at the <unk> and <unk> much faster .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or on the <unk> of the <unk> just because it &apos;s <unk> , or -- in the <unk> <unk> -- in the field of diversity -- and you don &apos;t even understand that <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> diversity .
The <unk> of that is , of course , <unk> <unk> .
When you &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
It &apos;s not just <unk> by a language , or a series of rules .
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of the <unk> that the <unk> of every culture comes in the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a <unk> , a thought , a <unk> of <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we sit here in <unk> , at least half not <unk> in the <unk> of children .
They &apos;re not <unk> to children , which means less than <unk> , which is <unk> not <unk> something , which are already <unk> .
What is more <unk> of being <unk> by <unk> , of the last few of being <unk> , of the last <unk> to talk about the language , of not <unk> the <unk> of the children ?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of someone in a few weeks , every two weeks , every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> , and he brings it into the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> language .
And I know anybody who &apos;s you say , &quot; Do you know ?
The world would not be a better place if we <unk> all the same language ? &quot; <unk> , we all talk . &quot;
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> a <unk> , what it means to be able to talk about their language .
And so I &apos;d like to take you a journey through the <unk> --
And in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we &apos;re <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say &quot; different ways of <unk> &quot; I mean , different ways of <unk> .
So , for example , this <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> to <unk> from the river of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> that can &apos;t <unk> the blue color from green because it &apos;s <unk> in the forest because the time <unk> is <unk> in the forest , which <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; : you have to <unk> a person talking about a language .
All of this has <unk> past , but the <unk> is that in these <unk> <unk> where they talk are talking about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> nobody <unk> .
You can hear and listen to and then I started talking .
I had one of the most interesting <unk> I lived with , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> contact with a <unk> <unk> .
They did <unk> from the <unk> photographs that <unk> them in <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> <unk> forest <unk> had never seen anything .
They <unk> photos , they <unk> it from the ground , they <unk> their <unk> to find a shape or a <unk> , and they <unk> their five <unk> with the <unk> .
But <unk> not only <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> to each other .
<unk> percent of the <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We went to eight <unk> and we found two <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we found two cases of them , they <unk> that one of them was so <unk> that he &apos;s dead , and then they <unk> it . They <unk> that they had a <unk> <unk> forest .
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> species .
In the early &apos; <unk> , I was a really interesting <unk> when my <unk> <unk> <unk> , if I wanted to go to <unk> between the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
To make sense of <unk> , I should have to understand the <unk> culture , and the <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a very <unk> <unk> vision of the world .
Very interesting .
If you were to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , what would you like ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking about Africa , that <unk> has no <unk> <unk> . And instead , you know , the <unk> is not anything else the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
What makes interesting is that <unk> is the <unk> between life and death .
So <unk> do <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> in alive so that for a short <unk> is the <unk> .
That &apos;s why <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> go to <unk> and talk about God .
We <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> God . &quot;
And since you are <unk> , is the spirit that you have <unk> , how much you can <unk> you ?
So you start to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> in the state of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather strong <unk> of the power of the mind when it was <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> that I &apos;ve lived with the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> civilization <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> has never been <unk> by <unk> .
They are <unk> by a <unk> , but their education is extraordinary <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> away from <unk> to <unk> <unk> , and they live in a world that has been <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> years of the <unk> <unk> for <unk> to <unk> the nine months of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of mother , now are <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
For that time , they &apos;re <unk> to the values of their society , their <unk> , their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and just their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to the best to say the <unk> <unk> .
And so , at the end of this incredible <unk> , they <unk> out for the first time in their <unk> , to 18 years , see a <unk> . And that <unk> <unk> <unk> . And in that moment of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , everything they learned in theory is <unk> . And in that moment of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , everything that they learned in the theory of all of it . The <unk> does a step back and says ,
&quot; <unk> ? <unk> as I said . &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> . Now it &apos;s <unk> to you . &quot;
They &apos;re called <unk> greater <unk> , and they say , we &apos;re the <unk> of the world &apos;s <unk> .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think of the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> environment , <unk> <unk> and the old story of <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> concept in his <unk> , or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are closer to Earth .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by <unk> .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> , but because of time and <unk> , have created a <unk> of Earth , not on the concept of <unk> <unk> but on a <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> . The concept that the Earth can only live because it &apos;s <unk> by human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
I mean , a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the mountain is a different <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> will be a different <unk> and will have a <unk> relationship with the mountain or that place to a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a mountain or place to be <unk> .
<unk> of a <unk> , or a <unk> is <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
And that made me a human being different from my friends , who believe that <unk> are <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> who live in the <unk> <unk> .
If we start <unk> that these <unk> can create different , we can actually start to understand some of their <unk> <unk> <unk> . They <unk> this <unk> .
I <unk> this picture of <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
Some of you may have heard about the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is not the <unk> potential of <unk> , but his <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> from two elements .
On one side , this <unk> <unk> that has a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> only one has a <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> a little bit of <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> with a <unk> of a <unk> of the <unk> family said <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you ever see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . <unk> &apos;t create a <unk> . It creates the <unk> of reality .
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of the <unk> <unk> in the &apos; <unk> in the &apos; <unk> .
In my <unk> , you can &apos;t <unk> these <unk> as a <unk> because if you &apos;re not able to tell anybody to be <unk> . <unk> <unk> , but they can &apos;t be <unk> <unk> because I &apos;m <unk> by a <unk> that is of course in the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s possible to <unk> <unk> only if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now , this is the <unk> that you find in this <unk> are <unk> of <unk> , the same kind of <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> question : in a <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of plants , how they do these <unk> two <unk> not , but that if they <unk> in this way , they create a <unk> that is to <unk> .
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you go to the <unk> , we &apos;ll talk about &quot; <unk> us . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , who <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that in our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If you <unk> it as they <unk> their <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , you don &apos;t know everything ? &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
The solution is : you get the <unk> <unk> in a <unk> of the full and <unk> with a different <unk> .
And that &apos;s not going to get to <unk> , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , &#91; <unk> &#93; the problem is that the ones who have to <unk> <unk> , but somehow <unk> to the story of our real world than our real world , and it <unk> beyond .
In fact , the <unk> century , not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk> , but rather like the <unk> <unk> , but rather the <unk> was where we <unk> and <unk> <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of mass <unk> of <unk> diversity and <unk> the planet &apos;s <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the planet . Now the problem is not the problem .
All the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> like <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s not the change technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It &apos;s the power .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you look at the world , you &apos;ll notice that these are not <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> creatures and <unk> out of existence by <unk> forces that have to <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> who lived in the forest until a generation ago , and now <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> , where you can see the river <unk> from the <unk> that seems to <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> .
If you <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the <unk> <unk> of politics .
As <unk> <unk> , <unk> physics of a <unk> , is <unk> to the <unk> level , but the <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> &apos;s <unk> , not only is <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it &apos;s part of the development of the development of <unk> .
And you can &apos;t understand the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> until you go in the beginning .
I <unk> miles from <unk> into China through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only you get to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only you get to see what the <unk> <unk> to talk about .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> to the <unk> <unk> .
which means that it &apos;s been <unk> in the <unk> of Chinese times of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that led to the <unk> <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and her <unk> was <unk> .
It was taken of <unk> in <unk> at the age of two <unk> under his <unk> because he could not have to live without living without him .
The <unk> , which has done the same , was <unk> in <unk> .
And she <unk> a day , she <unk> a <unk> <unk> , and , it was <unk> to <unk> jobs for seven years .
The pain of the <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of <unk> is by <unk> .
<unk> , all of the whole thing <unk> to a choice .
Do you want to live in the <unk> world , or are we going to <unk> the <unk> world of diversity of the diversity of the diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died said that the largest fear was that , in our <unk> <unk> vision , not only <unk> the entire <unk> of the world &apos;s <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of thinking , but a day we <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> of thought , but a day we <unk> us from a <unk> <unk> that <unk> there were other possibilities .
And it &apos;s <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , who has given us <unk> to <unk> , who <unk> us to the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , creating the <unk> of the <unk> , creating the <unk> of the <unk> , and we &apos;re talking about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has to <unk> 300 years old .
That <unk> story I didn &apos;t tell you that we have the answers all the challenges that <unk> to <unk> .
When you <unk> these <unk> <unk> , what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> <unk> different <unk> .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all know the possibility of what we are : a <unk> species , which has to <unk> that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are great moments of <unk> .
I took this picture on the <unk> <unk> in <unk> island , when I went to <unk> with <unk> <unk> , and this man , <unk> me , he <unk> the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The <unk> government has not been <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> for <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> for his life , <unk> away all the <unk> , and all of his <unk> .
You have to know that <unk> don &apos;t <unk> the cold , you &apos;ll see it .
The <unk> of the <unk> were made of <unk> fish <unk> in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn &apos;t <unk> from the night or the <unk> who <unk> .
It <unk> away , it <unk> up , it <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did <unk> , I <unk> them by , they <unk> them by it <unk> , they <unk> a <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk> , <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> has created a <unk> , <unk> another dog , and he &apos;s <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Do you want to talk to you ? <unk> . And this , in different ways , &#91; <unk> &#93; is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> the government <unk> has <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> control of an area of bigger than the California and of <unk> <unk> together .
It &apos;s their new <unk> . It &apos;s called <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> all the <unk> resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> at least , at least , who we &apos;ve been in these <unk> <unk> areas of the planet , we realize that they &apos;re not <unk> at all .
It &apos;s home .
<unk> <unk> of human imagination that we <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> . And for all of these children , like the dreams of our children , they become part of the <unk> <unk> of hope .
And finally , we <unk> <unk> are <unk> that <unk> never to <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> --
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell the world &apos;s stories . Every month we have the world . Every month we have <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public in places to <unk> our public places in <unk> , from how much they &apos;ve seen and , <unk> a time for the central <unk> , the <unk> world of <unk> to <unk> in <unk> , the <unk> world , to find a <unk> world in a <unk> and <unk> .
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I &apos;ve written in this book that I hope you &apos;ve already heard and you &apos;ve already heard some <unk> , in case you don &apos;t know .
I want to start with what I call the <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> : &quot; If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens . &quot; The way to do it is to <unk> freedom <unk> . &quot;
The reason is , on one side , in the fact that freedom is itself a value , is <unk> , useful , useful for human beings .
<unk> else is that if we &apos;re <unk> , every one of us can do it for all of us to do everything that <unk> our <unk> , without nobody <unk> in the name of our <unk> .
The way to <unk> freedom is <unk> choice .
The more choices and people have , the more <unk> , and more of them is their <unk> .
This , <unk> , is so <unk> <unk> in society that nobody is <unk> to <unk> .
And it &apos;s also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you a few examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I <unk> a simple note on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> that you can buy to the number of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that nobody <unk> . <unk> already that nobody is <unk> to your <unk> .
That &apos;s what the <unk> is .
And then you go to the <unk> store a <unk> : <unk> , radio , <unk> , radio , <unk> , radio , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there &apos;s a big number of <unk> <unk> .
We can do six and a half million different <unk> using <unk> that there are in one <unk> .
<unk> <unk> there is a <unk> choice .
<unk> fields : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the <unk> services , <unk> <unk> , <unk> they were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , you don &apos;t <unk> it .
A <unk> of that , the <unk> was that the phone is not going to be <unk> .
These days have gone .
We have now a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , especially in cell phones .
Here &apos;s cell phones .
My <unk> is in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
If you don &apos;t still have seen it in the house , you &apos;re very <unk> , very soon it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
And what happens is that people <unk> in the <unk> and they ask this question . And what happens is the answer ? The answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t make things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : It &apos;s not going to be in the United States that you &apos;re <unk> from <unk> and <unk> you have to do .
Instead , <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> says , &quot; OK , we can do A , or <unk> , &quot; A <unk> , &quot; <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You said , &quot; <unk> , what do you do you do ? &quot;
And the <unk> says , &quot; He has these <unk> and these <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> and these <unk> . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; <unk> if you were me , what would you say ? &quot;
And the <unk> , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
And the result we call it <unk> <unk> , <unk> that makes it look like a good thing .
But it &apos;s not really a <unk> that weight and <unk> the responsibility for taking something , and it &apos;s not in the <unk> <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> , to somebody else that doesn &apos;t know -- and almost certainly is <unk> -- and then not in the <unk> <unk> to make decisions about the patient decisions , which is .
There &apos;s a huge <unk> of products , which is <unk> to people like me and you , that if you think does not make sense , because we can &apos;t <unk> it .
But if we can &apos;t <unk> it , why are we going to <unk> them ?
The answer is , they want to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> so <unk> is a <unk> of choice , as we see in this <unk> , as you see in this <unk> . We don &apos;t want to <unk> children . They want to sex . &quot; We don &apos;t want to <unk> . &quot; We have to <unk> it .
And we can <unk> how many times they <unk> .
That means that every <unk> , at <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
We went to the family and to <unk> , a time perspective , the common perspective , almost for anyone , who had to have the <unk> as soon as possible .
The only real choice was to who , not when , and what to do after that .
<unk> , all of it is really to play .
They &apos;re very smart students , and they &apos;re going to be 20 percent less job than a time .
And they &apos;re not because they &apos;re less <unk> , they &apos;re not <unk> , because they &apos;re <unk> .
but because I &apos;m <unk> , I started to say , &quot; <unk> <unk> or not ? Do you want to do that now ? &quot;
&quot; Do you want to think before the children or <unk> ? &quot;
They are <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this <unk> <unk> , even if this <unk> doesn &apos;t <unk> <unk> <unk> and do a <unk> <unk> to my <unk> .
And they really have to do that . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the job : we &apos;re <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because the technology <unk> us to work every minute , from every corner of the planet , <unk> that from the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> , and I won &apos;t say anybody , where the <unk> works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this incredible means is that we have about the job ? It &apos;s that we have to decide , <unk> at any time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son to play <unk> , with the cell phone , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , on the <unk> .
And even though they &apos;re all <unk> , every minute that we see our son <unk> the <unk> , we &apos;re also <unk> , &quot; Do I have to answer this call ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this <unk> ? I have to take this letter ? I have to take this letter ? I have to <unk> this letter ? I have to <unk> this letter ? I have to <unk> this letter ? I have to <unk> this letter letter ? I have to <unk> this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , that makes the experience of your son very different than that would have been in other conditions .
So , any of all of the <unk> , things and big , objects and life , life is a matter of choices .
And once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but not everything was about choice .
The world &apos;s world today to this : The <unk> is , &quot; Is it a <unk> , or <unk> ? &quot;
The answer is <unk> .
So , the <unk> <unk> we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the <unk> .
<unk> this choice two <unk> effects of people who are <unk> .
The first , <unk> , is that he <unk> instead of <unk> .
With a lot of <unk> between you and you get very hard to do .
I &apos;ll give you an example : a <unk> study on <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> has had access to <unk> data , <unk> society , <unk> society of <unk> <unk> , with about a million <unk> <unk> in <unk> different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 to solutions that are <unk> <unk> in more , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> two percent .
With 50 <unk> , there &apos;s 10 percent less than <unk> than when they &apos;re only <unk> . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> between them , and you have a hard time to decide , and choice <unk> to <unk> .
And <unk> , and still <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , and of course <unk> never comes to the <unk> .
<unk> that means not only that these <unk> <unk> food for <unk> because they don &apos;t have enough money , they want to say that the decision is so <unk> that they will also <unk> the <unk> <unk> of work .
They &apos;re not going to <unk> , until five <unk> <unk> per year from the job <unk> , that would be very well <unk> to <unk> .
So <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices .
And I think it &apos;s going to change the world .
&quot; And finally , &quot; <unk> , <unk> or <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
You know , you have to make the right decision , if it &apos;s for <unk> , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong wrong , and you &apos;ll <unk> the wrong <unk> .
So that &apos;s the first effect . The second is that even though we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice , at the end is less <unk> by the result of how we <unk> states with less <unk> .
And that &apos;s a number of reasons .
One of them is that with so many <unk> between the <unk> , if you <unk> one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine you could have a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that is that <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> choice , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the decision <unk> that decision , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> that decision , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that decision ,
even when it was a <unk> decision .
The <unk> choices are , you can <unk> that &apos;s <unk> of choice .
And also , there &apos;s what <unk> call them .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well known as the value of which we give things from what we <unk> .
You know , when there are lots of <unk> possible , it &apos;s easy to <unk> the <unk> <unk> and to be less <unk> than the <unk> <unk> that has <unk> .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;ll <unk> with all of the ones that are not in New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably <unk> .
There &apos;s this <unk> to the <unk> .
A <unk> place .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not going to <unk> . But what he thinks , &quot; Well , <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; <unk> , my <unk> <unk> are away . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> right in front of home . &quot;
And it <unk> two weeks <unk> from the idea that &apos;s <unk> -- every day -- the possibility of <unk> where you want .
The <unk> <unk> the <unk> for what we have , even when choice was <unk> .
And the more <unk> that we have from <unk> , the more the <unk> <unk> <unk> up against you .
Here &apos;s another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It &apos;s about living the moment , and maybe it &apos;s about the way , and maybe the way .
But the most important point is that you &apos;re <unk> , you &apos;re not going to be doing other .
The things that they don &apos;t know a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk> .
It &apos;s almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were just one like , <unk> them and <unk> <unk> , they were <unk> , only after <unk> a <unk> and <unk> a lot of times , they would go to be good .
So , I started <unk> a couple of new when the people were there , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . &quot;
And the <unk> said , &quot; Do you want to <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
Do you want them to <unk> or <unk> ? &quot; <unk> &quot; or &quot; <unk> &quot; ? &quot;
&quot; Do you want to <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> wants to <unk> or <unk> ? &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; <unk> <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a while I was able to say , &quot; I want the only kind of -- that was the only kind of , for a <unk> I would <unk> all over the time . So I was <unk> <unk> <unk> , then <unk> from the store , <unk> , and the best <unk> of <unk> I ever had .
It was <unk> . I had all that choice I &apos;d <unk> the best .
But I got worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book <unk> .
And the reason I was worse is that with all of that choice , my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn &apos;t know anything about <unk> when I was just one like , but when I was 100 different , I was like a great one . But when I was going to be 100 different , I was going to be perfect .
What I &apos;d <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After I <unk> that I was <unk> in <unk> , I was <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in life of people , it &apos;s not <unk> the <unk> that these have respect to the <unk> of <unk> themselves .
And that <unk> less <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of the <unk> , it makes it .
Because if I <unk> it , I &apos;m not going to talk about what I &apos;m talking about .
The <unk> truth to that .
&quot; You &apos;d better be when you &apos;d better be worse . &quot; The reason you &apos;d better be <unk> when you were worse , you know , you know , <unk> <unk> .
In the world , we live in -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are at the <unk> of <unk> .
You never have to <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , your <unk> , are <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; Yes , you want it . &quot;
I mean -- little <unk> moment -- that I &apos;m really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I could not have done better , I didn &apos;t have <unk> .
But <unk> isn &apos;t always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> , when you just have that kind of <unk> is that when you &apos;re not <unk> , and you will say , &quot; Why ? &quot;
Who is <unk> ? &quot; The answer is <unk> .
The world is <unk> . What do I do do with this ?
When there are hundreds of types of <unk> , and you get one <unk> , and you know who is the <unk> , is clear that the <unk> you are .
<unk> , you could have done better .
With hundreds of <unk> , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even if the result , it &apos;s <unk> , they <unk> and they give their <unk> .
In the last few years , <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only one , but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is that people have experiences because the <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> that they think <unk> is they think they &apos;re <unk> .
So the final result is that in general we &apos;re better , but we &apos;re going to have worse .
Let me just give you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all get for good and is completely <unk> . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no <unk> that a little bit better than not to <unk> at all , but it &apos;s not going to be <unk> to be a little bit better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a <unk> value , <unk> . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve <unk> from a piece of the level of <unk> the <unk> choices that we <unk> our lives .
Now , from a <unk> point of view -- I almost finished -- from a <unk> point of view , <unk> is the <unk> .
What &apos;s going to do all this choice in <unk> society is <unk> .
There are many places in the world , and you have to <unk> , where the problem is not that they have choice .
The problem is they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> that I &apos;m talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does is , and <unk> is , <unk> <unk> has talked about yesterday about how those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> are <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> of money .
I mean these choices , <unk> and <unk> , not that they are just <unk> .
They are <unk> <unk> .
They make worse being .
If a little bit of what we do in our society <unk> choice was <unk> in those where people have too much chance , it &apos;s not only their lives to <unk> but also our own .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income does not only -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that <unk> us .
And to <unk> , &quot; <unk> , you can become everything you want , &quot;
<unk> , people of culture , I said , &quot; What are you going to happen ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s <unk> that you can &apos;t do anything in a glass <unk> . &quot;
&quot; A <unk> imagination , a <unk> vision of the world --
and I <unk> it like this , I <unk> it , at the beginning .
But then , I realized , I was that fish knows the long knows that fish knows the long knows long .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you <unk> in <unk> , so that &quot; everything is possible . &quot; You can &apos;t <unk> freedom . You get the <unk> . &quot;
If you <unk> the <unk> so you can <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
They all need a <unk> .
This is almost certainly almost too <unk> , maybe for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
