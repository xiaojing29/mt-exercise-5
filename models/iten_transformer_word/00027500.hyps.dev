<unk> year I showed these <unk> for <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for nearly three million years , had the size of the United States , is <unk> percent .
<unk> this <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a certain sense , the heart <unk> of climate system .
It <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> for the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
As you can see , it <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That &apos;s the ice in <unk> , which <unk> last summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , of five years , it &apos;s like the blood , which here is <unk> from the body .
In 25 years , in the past 25 years .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> is <unk> around the ocean <unk> , where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> , are <unk> in <unk> from the <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , the amount of <unk> <unk> , that amount of <unk> , <unk> this <unk> point .
In a few <unk> <unk> in <unk> the <unk> is already <unk> by water .
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> was <unk> with a <unk> <unk> last <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! Al <unk> : She &apos;s good . The question is if we do it .
One is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the north .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> never <unk> like this .
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you want to know how the sea level <unk> for the <unk> <unk> on <unk> , here is where the sea <unk> .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
On the other side of the planet : <unk> , the largest ice <unk> of the planet .
<unk> month scientists have <unk> that the ice <unk> is in <unk> , and that the Western <unk> , which <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> at six feet of <unk> , like <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the largest third <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which few years ago were <unk> .
40 percent of the world population <unk> half of <unk> water from that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : this <unk> is the source of <unk> water in this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when it <unk> , the same thing happens to <unk> water .
In California , <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of 40 percent .
<unk> <unk> are in crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they &apos;re <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the world leads to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and without <unk> .
<unk> times <unk> in the last 30 years of <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the whole <unk> .
If you look at it in the <unk> context , you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we have <unk> millions of CO2 <unk> every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the ocean every day .
Look at <unk> the area of the <unk> <unk> , from <unk> , to <unk> , and on both <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , where there is an oxygen <unk> in the ocean .
The biggest cause of global warming , together to <unk> , which is <unk> use .
<unk> is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of two countries with more emissions with China .
And it <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> .
But we &apos;re starting to a <unk> of direction .
These are <unk> projects over the last few years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
So , there &apos;s a political <unk> in our country .
The <unk> of <unk> and oil have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
<unk> image I <unk> something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it on the <unk> .
This is the second largest flow in America .
It happened around <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> â™« <unk> <unk> is a <unk> and happy .
It &apos;s <unk> here in America , and <unk> our economy .
<unk> the <unk> is <unk> .
It &apos;s at good price , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
Al <unk> : This is a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The largest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> . <unk> : <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al <unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> , we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> in our business .
For our <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to public and <unk> the truth about <unk> .
In fact , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it &apos;s <unk> -- it &apos;s got a good <unk> .
So we don &apos;t talk about climate change .
We want to do that .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you &apos;ve heard about that .
So we <unk> a turn into a <unk> <unk> , as it is about <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> are a little <unk> , but this is the sound of <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> is between the main <unk> of global warming , but the <unk> technology of <unk> that you see change everything .
Let &apos;s look at this : this is the <unk> technology of <unk> .
Al <unk> : <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security .
<unk> : <unk> , America is in the crisis ; the economy , the national security crisis .
The <unk> that all the <unk> : our <unk> from <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and oil .
Now , though , there &apos;s a new solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan for <unk> America to work , <unk> more <unk> , and help <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that <unk> to solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
Al <unk> : This is the last .
<unk> : It &apos;s about <unk> energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> the <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , a new network .
<unk> <unk> 2 : <unk> <unk> for jobs .
<unk> : <unk> America . It &apos;s time to be <unk> .
Al <unk> : A <unk> <unk> <unk> says , &quot; If you want to go alone .
If you want to go far , go . &quot;
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED I did a <unk> on <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to talk about how the machine works .
So here we go . And for the people who were not there , the <unk> is the biggest scientific experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
His job is to <unk> the conditions that were present was less than a <unk> of the universe -- to <unk> million times a second .
This is simply <unk> .
This is the <unk> machine .
<unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk> .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> feet , and it &apos;s <unk> feet .
This is a <unk> picture of building <unk> so you can see the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of last year we <unk> the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> of particles that had done all over the <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles inside the <unk> .
In other words , when you <unk> that picture , the <unk> <unk> , the machine that the <unk> , which is a great <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if that was that to make us more or this , when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the page was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a <unk> impact on that scientific <unk> .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> bring <unk> <unk> when the machine works at the <unk> of <unk> .
Now , the <unk> of you <unk> the <unk> and <unk> , &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot;
And instead they can do it because when they &apos;re very <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees , at least <unk> degrees <unk> to that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> an electric <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and who are <unk> about 30 <unk> .
They got about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , which we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
It &apos;s now <unk> everybody in their <unk> place .
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> will be new <unk> .
We <unk> it , and we &apos;ll try to get <unk> data or <unk> , and continue that way our <unk> to find out what the universe is .
Now , of course , in some ways , these <unk> <unk> <unk> the value of science and engineering <unk> . It &apos;s easy to <unk> .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact that it &apos;s the value of things like <unk> .
I &apos;d like to end with a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who , <unk> , in <unk> of <unk> <unk> experiments of his <unk> , his <unk> was Michael <unk> , who was Michael <unk> , said , &quot; This is not <unk> for the progress of the human mind as the <unk> that ideas of science are <unk> , that our <unk> are <unk> , and that our <unk> are <unk> , and that there are no new <unk> .
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to <unk> when , as a children , <unk> with <unk> .
<unk> like <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , in fact , to think and <unk> problems and <unk> relationships .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way most of the world around us .
So , as a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects , with my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started asking myself , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having the <unk> <unk> <unk> as a digital <unk> that &apos;s moving on a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> with both hands .
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
And the question was so interesting that we were trying to explore the answer , building <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , they can feel their movement and feel their own movement and hear a screen .
But <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> .
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> the digital information .
And as <unk> as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement , others . And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement , of the other people , how we can explore new and <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
Let &apos;s start with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you some of the video . If you put it in one direction , the <unk> video like this , if we <unk> on the other side .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> .
If you <unk> them , you know what it &apos;s them around .
If they get <unk> , and they can <unk> it a little bit .
If they get <unk> , and they can <unk> it a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We then realized that one of the interesting <unk> was that one of the interesting <unk> was to use common on data , for example , <unk> a color <unk> as if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> of <unk> and I can <unk> it to <unk> the color in that <unk> , where they <unk> .
and I can <unk> to <unk> color in that central color , where they <unk> .
If you <unk> too much , we can <unk> a little bit .
There are also <unk> possibilities of <unk> , like <unk> , <unk> , mathematics and games of <unk> where people can <unk> things , and <unk> the results immediately .
I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of <unk> that I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a game of words , which is <unk> half between <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at any <unk> <unk> a letter <unk> on every <unk> , <unk> , at every <unk> , at every <unk> <unk> a letter in <unk> , and while I was trying to <unk> him on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , <unk> , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here are <unk> kids in <unk> at the <unk> <unk> , I did <unk> them , and I <unk> them a video .
They &apos;re very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things about this is that you don &apos;t have to give people many <unk> .
I just wanted to say , &quot; <unk> of words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here is other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , there on the right .
It was just <unk> <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
He wanted to build a tool for the <unk> of <unk> . He &apos;s <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now he brought a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> work ! Yes !
So , we <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can make the characters .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with open end , and it can decide what it &apos;s going on .
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with open end , and it can decide what it &apos;s going on .
<unk> : <unk> away , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time to show you is a tool that I recently realized , for <unk> and <unk> music .
It &apos;s a tool , that &apos;s recently <unk> and <unk> music .
The <unk> here are <unk> by <unk> like <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of these has four different <unk> , and you can choose which to use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence sequence from <unk> to your <unk> .
And it &apos;s just making a <unk> , &quot; sound &quot; and a sequence . &quot;
These are side effects that you can control live , like <unk> and <unk> .
It <unk> to a particular <unk> , and then <unk> to <unk> it .
And then you have the <unk> effects of time and <unk> , which is <unk> to the whole sequence .
<unk> how it works .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> a base in two <unk> , &quot; sequence . &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
We &apos;re going to <unk> a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> of <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> : And now <unk> the <unk> to the <unk> , so I can control the effect of alive .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the whole sequence of time from one side or the other .
<unk> : <unk> : And now we <unk> the <unk> <unk> to give <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
So I don &apos;t have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> it , <unk> long or more <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the whole sequence on the left the <unk> &quot; <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain works and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to tell you is that it &apos;s going to <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects , which <unk> in our world the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to speak to all of you .
I &apos;m a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the <unk> of my life .
And it &apos;s not <unk> to me .
But I said this , something particular happened in my life , and in my career , that led me to <unk> the whole relationship with this job .
The particular thing is that I wrote this book , this <unk> called &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which , <unk> from my <unk> books , for some <unk> reason in the world and <unk> a big <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that <unk> everywhere now , people <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> from me now everybody <unk> and say , &quot; <unk> &apos;t you be able to do better ?
Do you want to keep writing for all of life without being able to create a book that can <unk> somebody ? &quot;
How could it help someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , except I remember that over 20 years ago , when I started saying to people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> to the same <unk> from fear .
And people said to me , &quot; <unk> &apos;t you know ?
<unk> &apos;t you that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> you ?
Do you have no <unk> to do this whole life without any of the life that nothing has ever come out and die on a <unk> of <unk> dreams with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> ?
So , you know .
The short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I <unk> all those things .
I &apos;ve always had fear .
And I have also fear of a lot of other things that people can &apos;t <unk> .
Like <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as far as I thought , and I &apos;d say , &quot; <unk> , &quot; Why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It &apos;s <unk> that anyone who <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel to do .
But what is there about this particular <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> about health <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not ?
How do my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> , and I don &apos;t remember one time in his 40 years of <unk> when he was <unk> <unk> ?
There was never -- that <unk> of the <unk> John , how did this ?
<unk> &apos;t you like that , <unk> ?
<unk> , the engineers <unk> like <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We have enough , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> but <unk> of all kinds , we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
And the other people who look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often <unk> by hand .
And those who don &apos;t seem to be <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before he died , in the last <unk> , he said , &quot; Every my book <unk> me about the work of their life .
But we didn &apos;t want to <unk> when we &apos;d say it because we &apos;ve heard these things so long , we have completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> , and that art , at the end , at the <unk> , at the <unk> .
And the question I want to tell you to all over here today is , are you agree with this idea ?
You &apos;re good at all this -- because it &apos;s also <unk> from a <unk> distance to me .
I think it &apos;s <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s also <unk> and I don &apos;t want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to <unk> our big <unk> to live .
And of course , I know , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start at that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> in my career .
<unk> -- I mean , look , I &apos;m quite young , I have about 40 years .
I still have about four jobs in me .
And it &apos;s very <unk> that any kind of <unk> that any time will be <unk> by the world as the work that <unk> after the <unk> of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we &apos;re all pretty much friends here -- is <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> thinking .
You know this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start <unk> at nine <unk> in the morning , and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so , it seems to me , after a lot of <unk> , that the way to work on creating a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I &apos;ve got to sort of security to me , which I &apos;m <unk> , and my natural <unk> on what the <unk> wrote . And as we <unk> for all last year . And as we <unk> for all last year , trying to find other society to see if you have the best ideas and more <unk> .
how to help people <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research led me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s because it <unk> in <unk> and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don &apos;t believe that creativity <unk> from men , OK ?
It turns out that creativity was this <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> to men with some <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for <unk> reasons .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
The <unk> were the same idea , but they <unk> that sort of spirit without a <unk> body .
which is <unk> , because the <unk> don &apos;t really understand that a <unk> was particularly smart .
I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> literally in the <unk> of the study of an artist &apos;s <unk> , a little bit like the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> out of that work .
<unk> <unk> , that &apos;s the distance I &apos;m talking about -- that <unk> <unk> you <unk> from your <unk> of your work .
And everybody knew it was so <unk> , right ?
So the <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like the too <unk> , right ?
If your work was <unk> , you didn &apos;t have to <unk> all the <unk> , you &apos;d have been <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your job <unk> , it wasn &apos;t all your <unk> , right ?
Everybody thought it was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and everything , and we <unk> this great idea ; we <unk> the human being at the center of the universe above all the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and no longer to <unk> creatures that <unk> from the <unk> .
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people started to think that creativity was completely from <unk> .
And for the first time in history , it <unk> to <unk> to this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> person with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think that &apos;s going to someone , a very simple person to think of being a <unk> like the source , <unk> and the <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a responsibility for too big to give <unk> human <unk> .
It &apos;s like to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and completely <unk> the <unk> and creates all of these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s been this pressure for <unk> artists to 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think that &apos;s true , the question becomes ,
Can we do that ?
They want to go back to a <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t <unk> 500 years of <unk> thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of , <unk> , do you do that people are <unk> to <unk> on their projects .
You probably won &apos;t think all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to <unk> is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t we <unk> this way ?
Because more sense of all the other things that I &apos;ve ever heard to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process .
A process that , as anyone who has ever <unk> to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- you know , you &apos;re not <unk> .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seem completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s now 90 years , but who &apos;s been a <unk> for all of life and said that in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> him in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> , <unk> him in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> him in the <unk> .
He said it was like a <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> towards her <unk> .
He <unk> him up , because he was <unk> the land under his feet .
<unk> to have one thing to do at that point , and it was , words , &quot; <unk> as a <unk> . &quot;
And so he went back to home and he was <unk> by this <unk> , and he didn &apos;t have anything else that take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> on the page .
<unk> times you can &apos;t get enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> them to get to the house , and the <unk> <unk> through the <unk> , looking , and she would <unk> through the <unk> , looking , as she said , &quot; another <unk> . &quot;
Then there were those times -- this piece of the time -- there were about the moments in which the time was almost <unk> , right ?
So , he was <unk> at home and he was looking for paper and he was trying to <unk> it through , and then he <unk> a <unk> just in the while he was <unk> with the other hand and the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the page <unk> and <unk> , but on the <unk> , from the last word to the first word .
So when <unk> <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not all of my <unk> process -- I &apos;m not a <unk> .
I &apos;m a <unk> , and the way of <unk> is ; <unk> at the same <unk> every day and <unk> and work and <unk> and work and <unk> on top of it .
But even I , in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I <unk> that a lot of you the <unk> .
You know , even though the work , and the ideas will <unk> me <unk> from a certain source .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it so we can &apos;t <unk> the head , but , rather , what about <unk> ?
For me , the best example , which I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;ve <unk> several years ago for a <unk> .
I was talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the artist <unk> <unk> , looking at these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , <unk> , and one day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> it all for him .
It <unk> fast and all of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> , who comes in his head like the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the <unk> , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the <unk> , but it doesn &apos;t know how to <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
So it starts to hear this kind of old <unk> <unk> in him like , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose it from this <unk> song .
I &apos;m not <unk> enough and I can &apos;t <unk> it . &quot;
And instead of going to the <unk> , they <unk> .
<unk> the whole <unk> process and did something completely new .
He just <unk> the sky and said , &quot; <unk> , do you can &apos;t see that I &apos;m <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Do you think it can write a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , <unk> at a <unk> moment when I can take care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> more .
<unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And the process of <unk> <unk> after this .
It didn &apos;t work , it was <unk> as always <unk> .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> had been <unk> when the <unk> , the <unk> that came out of him , the <unk> that came out of him and <unk> back where he came from where he was , and he was <unk> .
but <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> <unk> a conversation with <unk> and this thing that was <unk> and <unk> , but it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
So how much that <unk> story to change a little bit , even the way I &apos;m going to talk to me and already <unk> once .
This idea , I <unk> when I was <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; and <unk> , &quot; and <unk> in one of those <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> that we &apos;re all working on something and we &apos;re not going to have a book , which is going to be the <unk> book .
It &apos;s not just <unk> , just the book wrote .
And we started thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I <unk> to <unk> that <unk> air and <unk> us .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> corner of the room .
And I said , <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , what , both we know that if this book is not going to be <unk> <unk> .
Because you can see I &apos;m <unk> all I have , I have no longer than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to do your part .
Okay . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , I don &apos;t do anything .
I started writing the same because it &apos;s my job .
And I would like to <unk> that I &apos;m <unk> today to do my part . &quot; Because at the end is , OK -- <unk> does in the <unk> of the North Africa , the people will <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the moon , <unk> and <unk> music that will come back for and hours to <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every while , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists , actually <unk> .
And I know you know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you have all , at some point , a <unk> like this .
It was like time , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> , and it was not doing anything different from the usually , like the <unk> <unk> first , but everything <unk> .
And all of a sudden , not just like a human <unk> .
But it <unk> out of the <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , he <unk> it with his name .
<unk> hands and <unk> to <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , &quot; God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> by &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which is still you can hear in the <unk> or in <unk> .
In <unk> , when an artist has done something impossible and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it &apos;s <unk> because we need it .
But , the problem comes the next day , for the <unk> , when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> of God is there is no longer .
It &apos;s just a <unk> with most <unk> to the <unk> , and perhaps never <unk> to the <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God as they were <unk> , and what has to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s difficult .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so <unk> if you can &apos;t believe , <unk> , that the most <unk> <unk> of your being come from yourself .
But let me just show you that you data in <unk> from a <unk> source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to somebody else when you &apos;re finished .
And , you know , if we think it in this way .
And so I started <unk> , and it &apos;s certainly how I <unk> it for several months in the book that <unk> soon , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> of my success .
And what I have to keep <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , I &apos;m not afraid .
It &apos;s not <unk> . It &apos;s just your work .
<unk> <unk> for your part , any can be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , <unk> <unk> to you <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for one moment through your <unk> , then &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
<unk> , do you do the same <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; to yourself .
I think there , and I think <unk> <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; to you do that , even for having had love and <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know I &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects about the human genome , what &apos;s going on and discovery about new genes of genes .
We &apos;re now <unk> a new path . We have started <unk> biology and now starting from that digital code , we &apos;re <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We &apos;ve always been trying to <unk> big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many <unk> I think have <unk> to understand various levels .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to <unk> terms .
We &apos;re <unk> for almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go from the <unk> world of biology to the digital world of computers .
Now , what can we <unk> life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> species of the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> one even smaller .
We &apos;re able to <unk> a <unk> of about 500 genes that are here .
But when we take a look at his <unk> map , it &apos;s <unk> simple than our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at a time , it &apos;s very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell .
So , I realized that the only way to <unk> this <unk> so that the only way we could <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these <unk> questions .
And so we started the <unk> of &quot; Can we <unk> a <unk> ? &quot;
Can the chemistry <unk> to produce these big molecules that we &apos;ve never done before ?
And in case , can we make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> material .
The speed with which we are able to <unk> life is starting to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the genetic code , rather slowly , but it &apos;s <unk> .
And our most <unk> <unk> <unk> on a <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before .
But we discovered that DNA <unk> is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA , of the <unk> <unk> of 30 to 50 <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> process . <unk> the longer is there .
So we had to develop a new way to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this is our first <unk> , starting from information digital information <unk> genome .
It &apos;s a little virus that <unk> bacteria .
We designed the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of about <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> it in bacteria , bacteria have <unk> this <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> particles .
And the <unk> particles have been <unk> by the cells , are <unk> back , and they <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ve talked about <unk> members of the <unk> industry that they have certainly <unk> this model .
They have more than you .
We think this is a situation where the software can really build its own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we had to do the bigger things .
We had to build the entire <unk> of <unk> .
It &apos;s more than <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we thought of <unk> in the size of the virus , so we can change the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> with information <unk> in a computer , these must be very <unk> .
When we did this genome for the first time in <unk> the <unk> <unk> was of a <unk> for every 10 <unk> .
We discovered , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If we were used that original sequence never <unk> to do it .
A part of the process is designing <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build smaller <unk> that <unk> together .
<unk> elements here .
You &apos;ve probably read that we &apos;ve read that <unk> .
So , we have a <unk> code for four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together about 20 <unk> , and there is a <unk> order of <unk> for every <unk> .
So we can use the genetic code for writing , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did is we did at the beginning .
Some of them have been <unk> by the fact that it was not <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started <unk> parts , <unk> with <unk> <unk> from five to seven <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to them to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , at every step , we made these <unk> <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re trying to create an extremely <unk> <unk> <unk> as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to <unk> the process .
So , this looks like a <unk> <unk> .
When you get to these very <unk> <unk> , the more than 100 <unk> <unk> , you don &apos;t <unk> directly into the <unk> <unk> .
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> biology <unk> .
So we have <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> <unk> to <unk> DNA .
Here &apos;s an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> is <unk> .
In 12 hours , 24 hours , it &apos;s just as it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely <unk> .
You have to live under <unk> .
It &apos;s absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and it <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
Actually , NASA showed that this happens .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we &apos;ve built these <unk> , just using the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s such a big <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a time of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> that we did a little while ago .
It &apos;s more than <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s the biggest <unk> of a <unk> structure ever <unk> by man .
It has a <unk> <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a 10 <unk> without spaces , we just <unk> pages to <unk> this genetic code .
Now , how do we make it work ?
Of course , through a virus is a <unk> game .
It &apos;s a little bit more <unk> when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s easier even when it comes to <unk> cells like this : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the process of <unk> .
In <unk> , the <unk> is instead of <unk> the <unk> in the cell , but we have <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re able to do a <unk> <unk> from one cell to another and <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> species .
The two are different than men are <unk> .
We have <unk> a few <unk> in a way that they can decide which choice for this <unk> .
He then <unk> it with the <unk> so he <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell has been <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> went into the cell .
And <unk> <unk> that we didn &apos;t want to go beyond , but we tried to get more <unk> in there .
This is one of the biggest <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere , in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So people who think about evolution as a <unk> <unk> at a time that <unk> didn &apos;t understand a lot of biology .
<unk> of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> DNA .
The <unk> that was in the cell didn &apos;t <unk> one .
The <unk> <unk> that we <unk> it .
He <unk> , and he <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material , he <unk> it , and we <unk> with only the cell the cell and the new <unk> .
It has become blue because of the genes that we have <unk> .
And in a short amount of time , all the <unk> of a kind of <unk> , and <unk> of the whole <unk> into a new species , <unk> on the new software that we &apos;ve <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code <unk> exactly what we &apos;ve <unk> .
Now , this may be <unk> <unk> , but <unk> software DNA , we can change things <unk> enough .
Now , I &apos;ve already <unk> that you &apos;re not talking about <unk> -- but of progress from three million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> in which <unk> new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We &apos;re going to go from six and a half billion people over the next 40 years .
Just to give an example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> it in <unk> ; 40 years , there will be four .
We are <unk> problems now to find food , water <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , six and a half billion people .
It &apos;s even <unk> to do it for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , over 30 billion <unk> of <unk> .
That means 100 million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of <unk> process , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
In more we need to realize that all the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
In the world today , because of the <unk> <unk> all over the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that &apos;s <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry only <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here are data <unk> by reality and our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , because of these <unk> <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think about <unk> these 20 million <unk> of different genes or <unk> to <unk> the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> , chemistry or chemistry , or chemistry <unk> , production of <unk> <unk> .
This is an <unk> of some software <unk> that we &apos;re working on to be able to <unk> and design and design species on the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how to be .
We know exactly what their code is .
We &apos;re <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> generation .
You also saw you that <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We have <unk> second and third generation that will be <unk> from the <unk> to <unk> more than the <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way biology can have a huge impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> CO2 into matter before , which we are working on design to design , and we think we can have the first <unk> of <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> solar <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our discovery in the world , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> in the deep ocean , at about <unk> feet deep to the temperature <unk> of water .
It &apos;s <unk> by using hydrogen <unk> as energy source .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2 , which can easily be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to this process .
So <unk> we think we may be able to <unk> what we might be able to <unk> what the question is , &quot; What is life . &quot; <unk> , we have the <unk> goal for the entire <unk> industry .
<unk> . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can &apos;t you ?
<unk> a main source of energy .
<unk> , we &apos;re working for using the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk> .
You saw this year with the flu , we &apos;re always <unk> a year and with a dollar less when it comes to find the right <unk> .
I think that you can change building <unk> in <unk> .
Here &apos;s how the future could start to look <unk> <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> the tree with <unk> , <unk> , and finally <unk> cells .
It &apos;s so much to <unk> people .
Our purpose is to make a way of living long enough to try to <unk> it . Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
First of all , I &apos;m going to show you , the <unk> possible , some fundamental work , of the new technology that we &apos;ve brought to <unk> to a <unk> almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
It &apos;s a environment in which you can think of it is at local level that <unk> with a huge amount of <unk> data .
We &apos;re seeing here are <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a quick <unk> , <unk> the images as we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big it is the amount of information that we see , how big these <unk> of data or <unk> .
Most of them are common <unk> photographs , but this is a <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in any moment . It &apos;s also very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , which is not <unk> .
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
In fact , it &apos;s the text and not <unk> , we can do something like that , to make sure that it &apos;s a real <unk> of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little bit <unk> to read a <unk> book .
I won &apos;t tell you .
This is an <unk> example . This is a more <unk> example .
<unk> image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the real <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a kind of medium .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of The <unk> .
We &apos;ve created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much higher than the one that &apos;s used in a normal <unk> , and we <unk> on the <unk> content .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And that really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
It turns out that this <unk> <unk> to the <unk> and other <unk> like that , you don &apos;t have to be <unk> .
Of course , <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for these kinds of technology .
And on that I don &apos;t want to lose time , if we don &apos;t say that we have <unk> to give in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. <unk> over an image of NASA .
So now I &apos;m going to try something else .
This is actually live on the Web ; you can see it .
It &apos;s a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> , and the other is a very interesting <unk> that was done by <unk> <unk> , a <unk> student of Washington , with the help of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s live on the Web , <unk> by <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from an image to the other and have this kind of experience <unk> experience .
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here actually has a meaning .
So , the <unk> <unk> of the computers <unk> these images together , so that they <unk> to the <unk> places where the <unk> <unk> all close to the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> or <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of <unk> data , and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> that we &apos;ve done for the first time , to show you what <unk> is really the key behind this technology , the <unk> technology . And it &apos;s not quite <unk> by looking at the <unk> that we put in the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> <unk> and so on .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> and <unk> pictures of kinds of <unk> , other <unk> and <unk> and so on . <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> an image that has been discovered <unk> to this model .
So they &apos;re all <unk> images and have been all <unk> on the <unk> level this way .
And it &apos;s possible to <unk> this way .
You know , I would never have thought of <unk> to work for <unk> .
It &apos;s very <unk> to <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think we &apos;re going to see that it &apos;s a lot of different kinds of <unk> : from those cell phones <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> number , <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , we start looking for those <unk> .
Many are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
<unk> in there is a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from <unk> to the physics of this environment .
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now <unk> data by <unk> by the whole <unk> <unk> of how the Earth the land , from the whole <unk> , from the <unk> point of view and <unk> all those data together .
All those pictures become <unk> together , greater of the <unk> of the parts .
You have a whole model of the whole thing that <unk> .
Think about this as the <unk> of <unk> &apos;s work on Earth .
It &apos;s something that <unk> in <unk> complexity that people will <unk> it , and where people are going to <unk> it with <unk> .
Their photos are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people .
If somebody comes the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name , my picture of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> is <unk> of all those data , and I can use it as a <unk> to <unk> it in that space , in that <unk> , using the pictures , using the pictures of everyone else , and having a social kind of social <unk> and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all of this is extremely <unk> <unk> of every part of the land , <unk> not only by <unk> <unk> and <unk> images and <unk> , but from <unk> <unk> .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : Do I understand that ? What your software will allow us to do is that at some point , in the next few years , all the pictures <unk> from anybody in the entire world , will be <unk> <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is we &apos;re going to find out .
It &apos;s creating <unk> , if you want , in images .
And he &apos;s doing it on the content of the images .
And the thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> information that a lot of these <unk> images .
As you make a <unk> <unk> and the text on the Web , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the page , has a lot of information about the images .
Now , what happens if that picture comes to all your pictures ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really enormous . It &apos;s a <unk> effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it &apos;s really amazing . <unk> .
<unk> : I &apos;m going to leave you very much .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is that we can live between people who didn &apos;t <unk> <unk> <unk> , among those who have the past the wind , <unk> it in the <unk> <unk> of plants .
<unk> to think that the <unk> <unk> are even beyond the <unk> <unk> , or that the <unk> of <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> still <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , and that the idea that the world that we live in in the <unk> sense , but it &apos;s just a model of reality ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , good or bad , many <unk> does .
And , of course , all of the <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . Everybody <unk> .
We &apos;re ready to <unk> <unk> .
We have to deal with the <unk> of death , so we don &apos;t like <unk> and <unk> --
We all have an art .
What <unk> is the particular <unk> of the song , the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> .
He was the <unk> of my journey in the <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> , on the <unk> , the mother &apos;s mother &apos;s world .
All of these <unk> are <unk> that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And if you take a second , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of the world create a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet , and it &apos;s important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> , and you can <unk> the total <unk> of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , ideas , <unk> , <unk> in being from the human imagination .
<unk> is the <unk> <unk> of humanity .
It &apos;s the <unk> of what we can be and what we can be as <unk> species .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> was successful at the <unk> and <unk> much faster .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all species have been or is on the <unk> of the <unk> just because it &apos;s <unk> , or -- in the <unk> , in the field of <unk> diversity -- and you can &apos;t even at the <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> diversity .
The <unk> of this is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just <unk> by a <unk> or a series of rules .
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the medium in which the <unk> of every culture is coming in the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a <unk> , a thought , a <unk> of <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we &apos;re sitting here at <unk> , at least half is not <unk> in the <unk> of children .
They don &apos;t come to the children , which is to say , unless they do something , which are already <unk> .
What is there is more <unk> of being <unk> by the <unk> , of the last to speak a language , of the <unk> of being <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the children ?
This <unk> <unk> is the state of somebody in a part of the world every two weeks : every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> , and leads with them in the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> language .
And I know somebody about you say , &quot; <unk> &apos;t that ?
The world would not be a better place if we all the same language ? &quot; <unk> , then we &apos;re all <unk> . &quot;
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> a <unk> thing that means that we can &apos;t talk to her language .
And what I &apos;d like to do you a journey through the <unk> --
a little trip in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we &apos;re <unk> .
A lot of us <unk> that when I say &quot; different ways of <unk> , &quot; I mean different ways of <unk> .
For example , this <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , which <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s not able to <unk> the blue color from green , because the time <unk> is <unk> in the forest , which <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> <unk> , you have to <unk> a person talking a different language .
All of this has <unk> in the <unk> past , but the <unk> is that in these <unk> where they &apos;re talking about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> no one language .
He <unk> to listen and then he started talking .
I <unk> one of the most interesting <unk> with which I <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that has had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> contact with a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They did <unk> from the top photographs that <unk> them in <unk> that <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> forest had never seen anything .
They <unk> the ground pictures , <unk> them to a form of a form or a <unk> , and they didn &apos;t know anything , have <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with the <unk> .
But <unk> not only <unk> <unk> .
It <unk> with each other .
<unk> percent of <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We went back to eight <unk> , and we found two cases of natural death , and when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was so <unk> that he died , and then they <unk> it .
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and to <unk> the species .
In the early &apos; <unk> , I was <unk> a very interesting job when my <unk> of <unk> <unk> , if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> between <unk> society and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> .
For a sense of the <unk> , I should have to understand the <unk> culture , and the <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s quite a <unk> view of the world .
Very interesting .
If I &apos;m going to talk about the great <unk> of the world , what would you like ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent is always <unk> out , thinking about Africa that <unk> doesn &apos;t have <unk> <unk> . But instead , and the <unk> is nothing else that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> very <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes interesting is that the <unk> of the <unk> of life and death .
So <unk> do <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> of live in such a way that for a short moment , the <unk> becomes the <unk> .
That &apos;s why the <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> go to speak of God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . &quot;
And from the moment that you &apos;re <unk> , is the spirit that you have to <unk> you ,
So you get to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> in the state of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather strong <unk> of the power of mind on the body when it &apos;s <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> that I &apos;ve lived with the most <unk> <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> civilization <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> has never been <unk> by <unk> .
<unk> today are <unk> by a <unk> , but their training is extraordinary .
The young <unk> are <unk> away from <unk> to three or four years , and live in a world made of <unk> and <unk> in a <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> years of nine years from the way to <unk> the nine months of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of mother , now are <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
For that time , they are <unk> to the values of their society , values that <unk> their <unk> and just their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And at the end of this amazing <unk> , are <unk> <unk> out and for the first time , they see a <unk> . And in that moment of the <unk> of <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> , everything that they learned in the <unk> . And in that moment of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , everything that they learned in the <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> back and says :
&quot; <unk> ? <unk> as I said .
It &apos;s <unk> . Now it &apos;s <unk> to you . &quot;
It &apos;s called the biggest <unk> that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think about the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> , and the old story of <unk> <unk> , which is an <unk> concept in its <unk> or maybe <unk> and say that these <unk> are closer to Earth .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by <unk> .
There &apos;s no room for these things in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , but because of time and <unk> , have created a <unk> of the Earth doesn &apos;t on the concept of <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> , the idea that the Earth can only because it &apos;s <unk> by human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
I mean that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> the mountain of <unk> that <unk> its <unk> will be a different human , and will have a very different relationship with the mountain or that place to be a different relationship with the mountain or place to the mountain , or that <unk> to be <unk> .
whether it &apos;s a <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> to be <unk> .
That has <unk> me a human being different from my <unk> friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> who live in the <unk> <unk> .
If you think about <unk> that these <unk> can create different reality , we started to understand some of their <unk> <unk> . <unk> this <unk> .
I <unk> this picture of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes a fascinating thing about <unk> is not the potential of <unk> , but its <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> from two elements .
On the one hand , this <unk> <unk> that <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> you have a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit , but it &apos;s <unk> with the <unk> of a family <unk> said <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you &apos;re ever going to see the <unk> <unk> that make from a different kind of <unk> , <unk> it <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . <unk> &apos;t creates a <unk> . It makes no reality .
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of the <unk> <unk> in the &apos; <unk> in the &apos; <unk> .
In my <unk> , you can &apos;t <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you &apos;re done , you can &apos;t tell anybody to be <unk> . <unk> <unk> . <unk> can &apos;t be <unk> because I &apos;m <unk> by a <unk> that is , of course in the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s possible to <unk> <unk> if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Now this is the <unk> : the <unk> that are <unk> in this <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> of the same kind of necessary to <unk> the <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of plants , like these <unk> two <unk> not , but that if you <unk> in this way , they create a <unk> version that &apos;s <unk> . But if you <unk> it in this way , they make a <unk> version of the parts ?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you <unk> to the <unk> , we &apos;re going to <unk> , &quot;
What does it mean ?
This <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> of <unk> , who <unk> <unk> in the forest , and our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If the <unk> like <unk> their <unk> will <unk> us , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> of plants , you don &apos;t know everything ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take the <unk> <unk> in a <unk> of full moon and <unk> with a different <unk> .
It &apos;s not going to be <unk> , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , &#91; <unk> &#93; the problem is that even those of us who have to heart <unk> <unk> , but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of the history of our real world , and it <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , not 300 years , not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk> , but rather , like the was where we have <unk> and <unk> or <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> diversity and <unk> and <unk> of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All of the <unk> have been <unk> in a new possibilities for life .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> don &apos;t have <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> by <unk> and <unk> like <unk> don &apos;t have <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> by <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It &apos;s the power .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you take a look at the world , you know that these are not <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of existence by <unk> forces that go beyond their ability to <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> who lived in the forest until a generation ago , and now <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> , where you can see the <unk> of the <unk> , where you can see the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> .
If you <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the <unk> <unk> of politics .
As the <unk> , the <unk> physics of a <unk> , is <unk> at the <unk> level , but the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of life of a <unk> , not only is <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it &apos;s part of development .
And you can &apos;t understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you go from the beginning .
I <unk> <unk> miles from <unk> in the Western China through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> <unk> , I realized what &apos;s behind the <unk> that we &apos;re going to talk about .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> at the <unk> <unk> .
That means that it &apos;s been <unk> at the time of Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that led the <unk> in <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and her <unk> was <unk> .
It was taken of <unk> in <unk> at the age of two <unk> under his <unk> because he couldn &apos;t live without living him .
The <unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
One day , she <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to work for seven years .
The pain of the <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> of <unk> is by present .
<unk> , all <unk> to a choice .
Would you like to live in the <unk> world or we want to <unk> the <unk> world of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died said that his greatest fear was that , in our <unk> <unk> of the world , not just <unk> the whole <unk> of the world , not just <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination , to a <unk> <unk> <unk> of thinking , but one day <unk> us from a <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it &apos;s <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , who has given us <unk> , which has <unk> us to the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk> , creating the <unk> of the <unk> , and we &apos;re talking about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has for 300 years .
That <unk> history doesn &apos;t tell me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we <unk> to go .
When these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it is human , what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> different <unk> .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all <unk> the possibilities of being what we are : a <unk> species , which has to <unk> that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are great moments of <unk> moments .
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> part of the <unk> island , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> me , <unk> the wonderful story of her <unk> .
The <unk> government wasn &apos;t always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the &apos; <unk> to <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> .
The family , <unk> for his life , <unk> <unk> away all of the <unk> , and all of his <unk> .
You have to know that <unk> don &apos;t <unk> the cold , <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> were made of <unk> fish .
The <unk> of this man didn &apos;t <unk> from the night or the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> away , it <unk> the <unk> in the skin of <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did I <unk> her , she <unk> them by her , she <unk> them by making a <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> , and when <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> has created a <unk> , he <unk> another dog , and he &apos;s <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
Do you want to hear me with nothing ? &#91; <unk> &#93; And this , in different ways , &#91; <unk> &#93; is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> in the world .
<unk> <unk> the government <unk> has <unk> to <unk> the total control of a larger area of larger <unk> of California and <unk> <unk> together .
It &apos;s their new <unk> . It &apos;s called <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . It <unk> all the <unk> resources .
A <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> at least , at least , at least , to realize that they &apos;re not <unk> at all .
It &apos;s house .
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> at the time . And for us all , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of these children , become part of the <unk> <unk> of hope .
To end , we <unk> <unk> are <unk> that <unk> never to anything .
I think the <unk> --
It &apos;s not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and perhaps we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our site is <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public in places to <unk> our public in places of <unk> <unk> , from how much <unk> saw , and <unk> , for a time for the <unk> of the <unk> : the world <unk> of <unk> diversity , and we need to find a way of <unk> diversity , and we need to find a <unk> in a <unk> world . And we need to find a <unk> in a <unk> world .
where the <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I &apos;ve written in this book that I hope you &apos;ve already heard , and I &apos;m going to <unk> some <unk> , in case you don &apos;t know .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> of what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all <unk> societies . The <unk> <unk> <unk> : &quot; If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens , &quot; The way to do it is to <unk> freedom <unk> . &quot;
The reason is , on one hand , in the fact that freedom is itself a value , is useful , useful for human beings .
On the other is that if we &apos;re <unk> , every one of us can do everything that <unk> our <unk> , without any one <unk> in the name .
The way to <unk> <unk> is to choice .
The more choices are , the more <unk> , and the greater <unk> , is their <unk> .
This , <unk> , is so <unk> <unk> in the society that no one <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it &apos;s also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I got a very simple note on the <unk> for <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> that you can buy for an enormous amount of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that no one of the <unk> you already have <unk> .
That &apos;s what the <unk> is .
And then you go to the <unk> store a <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there &apos;s a large number of <unk> <unk> .
We can make six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one just store .
It turns out there &apos;s <unk> choice .
<unk> <unk> : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the <unk> services , <unk> <unk> , who were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , you don &apos;t <unk> it .
A <unk> of that , by the way , was that the <unk> never <unk> .
These days have gone .
We now have a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , especially between cell phones .
Here &apos;s cell phones in the future .
My <unk> is in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
If you haven &apos;t seen it yet in the store , you &apos;re <unk> certain that will soon be <unk> .
And what happens to the end is that people <unk> into the <unk> and ask this question . And you know what the answer is ? The answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : It doesn &apos;t happen in the United States that you are from the <unk> , and the <unk> will tell you what you have to do .
Instead , <unk> by the <unk> , and the <unk> says , &quot; OK , we can do A , or <unk> , &quot; A <unk> , &quot; <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You said , &quot; <unk> , what would you do ? &quot;
And the <unk> says , &quot; He has these <unk> and these <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> and these <unk> . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; <unk> if you were me , what would you say ? &quot;
And the <unk> said , &quot; But I &apos;m not <unk> . &quot;
<unk> we call it &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> that makes it look like a good thing .
But in fact , it &apos;s not a <unk> the weight and the responsibility of making decisions by somebody who knows something , <unk> the <unk> , to somebody else that doesn &apos;t know -- and it &apos;s certainly not in the <unk> <unk> to make decisions , which is the patient .
There &apos;s an enormous amount of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me and you , if you think about it doesn &apos;t make any sense , because you can &apos;t think about it .
But if we can &apos;t <unk> , why do we <unk> them ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> that we call the <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
And so <unk> how it is our <unk> now is a question of choice , as you can see in this <unk> . &quot; We don &apos;t want to <unk> kids .
And we can <unk> how many times they do .
That means that every <unk> , at <unk> , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
He went to the family and <unk> , a time perspective , the common perspective , almost for anyone , who had been <unk> as soon as possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and what to do after that .
<unk> , everything is really to play .
<unk> to students very smart , and they <unk> their 20 percent <unk> .
And it &apos;s not because they &apos;re <unk> , not because they &apos;re <unk> .
but because I &apos;m <unk> , you know , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> or not ? Can you do it now ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> later ? <unk> I have to think before <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
And they &apos;re trying to answer these questions , even if this <unk> doesn &apos;t <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and don &apos;t get a <unk> <unk> .
And they really have to do that . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the job : we &apos;re <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because the technology allows us to work every minute , from every corner of the planet , <unk> that from <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> , and I won &apos;t say anybody , where the <unk> works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What does that mean , this incredible <unk> of choice we have about work ? It &apos;s that we have to decide , <unk> at any time , if we need to work or not .
We can go to see our son , playing <unk> , with the cell phone in a <unk> , the other , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , on the <unk> .
And even though they &apos;re all <unk> , every minute that we see our son <unk> the <unk> , we &apos;re also <unk> , &quot; Do I have to answer this call ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> I have to <unk> this <unk> ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; No , this makes the experience of your son very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of us look , small things and big objects , life , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but not everything was about choice .
The world of today is this : The <unk> is , &quot; Is it a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? &quot;
The answer is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the <unk> .
<unk> this choice <unk> two people .
The first one , <unk> , is it <unk> instead of <unk> .
With a lot of <unk> between them , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I &apos;m going to give you an example . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
One of my <unk> has had access to the <unk> , the <unk> society , with about a million <unk> <unk> in <unk> different companies .
What she found was that for every 10 of the solutions that are <unk> more , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there is 10 percent in less <unk> than when it &apos;s only about five percent . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> between them , is very difficult to decide , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And in <unk> , and again in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , never <unk> .
<unk> that doesn &apos;t just mean that these <unk> are <unk> food for <unk> because they won &apos;t have enough money , they also want to say that the decision is so <unk> that it also <unk> the <unk> <unk> of work .
It &apos;s not <unk> , until about five <unk> <unk> per year from the <unk> of work , which would be <unk> to <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices .
And I think it <unk> the world like this .
&quot; And to end the <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
I really want to make the right decision , if it &apos;s for the <unk> , isn &apos;t it ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and <unk> the wrong <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even though we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice , at the end is less <unk> by the result of how we have less <unk> with <unk> .
And that for several reasons .
One of them is that with so many <unk> in which choice , if you <unk> one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> will allow us to <unk> to <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the decision , and the <unk> <unk> from the decision ,
even when it was an <unk> <unk> .
More choices you have , it &apos;s easier to <unk> than any <unk> that &apos;s <unk> of choice .
<unk> , there is also what <unk> call .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well known as the value of which we give things from what <unk> .
You know , when you have a lot of <unk> , it &apos;s easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and be less <unk> than the <unk> that is choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I <unk> with all those who are not in New York .
But that &apos;s what &apos;s probably going to happen .
There &apos;s this <unk> to the <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It &apos;s all for them .
It doesn &apos;t <unk> . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , <unk> , that &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; All my <unk> <unk> are away . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> right in front of home . &quot;
And it <unk> two weeks <unk> from the idea that it &apos;s <unk> -- every day -- the possibility of <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> the <unk> for what we have , even when choice was <unk> .
And the <unk> are the <unk> that we have from <unk> , the more the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot .
It &apos;s about living the moment , and perhaps of the way to live .
But the most important point is that anything you &apos;re <unk> , you &apos;re not doing other .
The things that don &apos;t <unk> have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a couple of <unk> .
It &apos;s almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were just a little guy , <unk> them and <unk> by <unk> , they were <unk> , only after <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
So , I went to <unk> a couple of new when the <unk> were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . &quot;
And the <unk> said , &quot; Do you want to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
Do you want them with <unk> or with <unk> ? &quot; <unk> &quot;
&quot; Do you want to <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> wants to <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> -- &quot; <unk> to <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a while I was able to say , &quot; I want the kind of -- which was the only guy . &quot; He had no idea what it was , so for an hour to me all <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then <unk> out of the store , <unk> , with the best couple of <unk> that I &apos;ve ever had .
It was the <unk> . With all that choice I &apos;d <unk> the best .
But I got worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book .
And the reason I was worse is that with all that choice , my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> had to be <unk> .
<unk> I had <unk> <unk> . I didn &apos;t get any <unk> when I was just one guy , but when I had 100 different , <unk> , at least one guy had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After I had <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in people &apos;s lives . It doesn &apos;t <unk> the <unk> that these have respect to the <unk> themselves .
And that <unk> <unk> , even when the <unk> are good .
No one in the world of the <unk> .
Because if I <unk> it , I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth of the truth of this .
&quot; He was better when he was worse , &quot; The reason he was better when he was worse was even possible to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are at the <unk> of <unk> .
You &apos;ve never <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> are <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
I mean -- little <unk> moment -- that I &apos;m really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t <unk> .
But <unk> isn &apos;t always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of <unk> a couple of <unk> <unk> when there is only that kind of <unk> is that when you &apos;re not <unk> , and I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; Why ? &quot;
Who is <unk> ?
The world is <unk> . What can I do ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of <unk> , and they <unk> a <unk> , and you know who is <unk> , is <unk> clear that the <unk> you are .
We could have done better .
With hundreds of <unk> <unk> , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even though the result , even though the result is <unk> and <unk> to them .
In the last few years , the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the one , but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is just that people have experiences because the <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation think that <unk> is .
So the final result is that in general we &apos;re better , <unk> , but we &apos;re worse .
Let me show you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and is completely <unk> . It &apos;s not true .
There is no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than at all , but this doesn &apos;t <unk> that a lot of choice is better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a <unk> value , <unk> . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve <unk> from a piece of the level in which the choices <unk> our lives .
Now , from a <unk> point of view -- I almost finished -- from the <unk> point , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What allows all of this choice in <unk> society is <unk> .
There are many places in the world , and you have <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that they have choice .
The problem is that they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> that I &apos;m talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> has talked about yesterday about how much those <unk> and <unk> for <unk> are <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> of money .
I mean these choices , <unk> and <unk> , it &apos;s not that they &apos;re just <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
They get worse .
If a little bit of what we do in our society <unk> choice was <unk> in those where people have too few possibilities , not only would not be their lives to <unk> , but also our <unk> .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income does good at all -- not just to the poor people -- not only because of this choice in <unk> that <unk> us .
And finally , &quot; <unk> , you can become everything you want , &quot;
I mean , people in culture , I said , &quot; But what <unk> that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s <unk> that you can &apos;t do anything in a glass <unk> . &quot;
&quot; A <unk> imagination , a <unk> view of the world --
and I <unk> it like this , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I realized that that fish knows the long knows .
Because the reality is that if you <unk> in <unk> the <unk> , so that &quot; everything is possible . &quot; You can &apos;t <unk> the freedom . You <unk> the <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> in a way that you can <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They all need a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
