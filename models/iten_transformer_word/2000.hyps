The year I &apos;ve been <unk> these <unk> for <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for three million years of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> percent .
And I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> problem because it doesn &apos;t <unk> the ice .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a sense , the <unk> of the <unk> system .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the summer .
The next <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> <unk> of the last years .
<unk> are <unk> in <unk> .
As you can see , you go to the blue <unk> .
That &apos;s the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> in the summer .
You can see that the <unk> <unk> , of five years or more , or more or more , that you can see the body .
In 25 years is the past , in so .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> around the <unk> around the ocean where there are <unk> <unk> <unk> that there are <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> , which may be <unk> , this is not <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , is already <unk> from water .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : You know , it &apos;s good . The question is if we <unk> .
It &apos;s why this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> .
This is a <unk> in the <unk> .
The <unk> never <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> in <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how to you want to know how to know , you &apos;re going to know how to know , it &apos;s the <unk> .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to be part of the most <unk> of the planet .
The month , they <unk> that the <unk> of the ice is in <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> on some <unk> on some <unk> , is <unk> <unk> .
<unk> feet feet of <unk> <unk> , like <unk> , like in <unk> .
<unk> , the third <unk> of the most <unk> of ice , you can see <unk> , which is a few years ago .
The <unk> percent of the world &apos;s <unk> of water from the water .
<unk> : this <unk> is the <unk> of water .
The <unk> is <unk> .
But when you look at the same water in water .
In <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> is <unk> of 40 percent .
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis .
<unk> , as you have to <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> .
The <unk> in the world to <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> times more than the last 30 years of <unk> .
This is a <unk> of all <unk> .
If you look at the <unk> in the <unk> , you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we have <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of every hours of <unk> in every day .
Look at the area of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> , and on the <unk> <unk> , where there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> , together , together to <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the <unk> of <unk> .
The oil is a problem , and the <unk> is even more .
The United States are one of two countries with <unk> , with China .
And you &apos;re going to build a lot of <unk> <unk> .
But we &apos;re <unk> to a <unk> of the direction .
This is the <unk> in the last years and some <unk> of <unk> .
And it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> in our country .
The <unk> of the oil <unk> have <unk> <unk> million dollars in the year for <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I <unk> this is --
<unk> , in <unk> , where I &apos;m going to live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> .
Maybe you have seen on <unk> .
This is the second most <unk> of <unk> in America .
It &apos;s been <unk> around .
The <unk> of one of the <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> â™« <unk> <unk> is a kind of <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> here in America , and ago .
<unk> the <unk> is always more <unk> .
It &apos;s good , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And then , <unk> here is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
The most <unk> <unk> on the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> -- <unk> -- <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- not know what they &apos;re talking about what are talking about .
So , I &apos;m going to <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> has two <unk> .
This is a <unk> of them , a part .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> , we see the <unk> <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> to our <unk> .
For this our <unk> is <unk> a lot of money in a <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it -- has a good <unk> .
So , I don &apos;t <unk> change .
We &apos;re going to do .
<unk> : <unk> -- <unk> -- you &apos;ve heard about it .
So , I &apos;m going to be a <unk> in a <unk> ,
<unk> ! <unk> are a little bit , but this is the <unk> of technology .
The <unk> of <unk> is between <unk> <unk> <unk> , but the <unk> of <unk> , but the <unk> technology that you can see all .
<unk> : You know , this is the <unk> technology of <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the question of the <unk> and that <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> America is in the <unk> of the economy , the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all of : our <unk> from <unk> , like <unk> , as the <unk> and oil .
Now , there &apos;s a new <unk> , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of energy , in 10 years .
A <unk> for <unk> America to work , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> the global global <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we &apos;re going to <unk> our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> .
So , this is the last one .
<unk> : <unk> : It &apos;s <unk> energy to America .
One of the ways of <unk> <unk> to the <unk> that <unk> from the planet that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , a new network .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
<unk> America . It &apos;s time . It &apos;s time to be <unk> .
And I <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> says , &quot; If you want to go , you to the <unk> , you go to the <unk> .
If you want to go , you go to , you go to , you go to the <unk> . &quot;
We have to go to the <unk> ,
Thank you very much .
<unk> year I &apos;ve been a <unk> on the <unk> .
And we <unk> to <unk> for <unk> on how it is .
So , I &apos;m going to see the one time , there were no longer , the <unk> <unk> , is the most <unk> <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The universe is <unk> <unk> that they were <unk> on the universe , in the universe of a second universe -- to <unk> million times .
All of it &apos;s just <unk> .
This is the car <unk> .
<unk> these <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
This is what work on the work . It &apos;s called <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> image of <unk> in <unk> .
The 10 year we have <unk> the <unk> machine for the car .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
This was <unk> in the room of <unk> .
It &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> of <unk> that had done all over the <unk> , <unk> in <unk> , <unk> <unk> , with a <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
In other words , when I <unk> that <unk> the 10 <unk> , which is a big <unk> , the <unk> that &apos;s a big <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if it was to <unk> about this , when somebody <unk> on Google <unk> and <unk> that &apos;s <unk> was this .
What we &apos;ve been <unk> in a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> a week , there was a problem with the car , to be <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> when you <unk> when the car is the <unk> of <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you <unk> <unk> and <unk> , &quot; <unk> and <unk> , &quot; it &apos;s too much . &quot; I &apos;m too <unk> . &quot;
And instead of that you can do that when they are very <unk> <unk> .
So , less <unk> , to a <unk> <unk> , to a <unk> to the space of the stars , these <unk> can <unk> .
In one of the <unk> between the most <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the <unk> .
Now , this is still more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that are <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s about 50 <unk> .
<unk> , what we have done ,
We have them and <unk> .
Now , they &apos;re all <unk> to their place .
<unk> the end of <unk> is going to be new <unk> .
And we <unk> it , and we &apos;re going to get to <unk> or <unk> , and we can <unk> to <unk> to <unk> that are the <unk> that <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of science and <unk> <unk> .
I think that &apos;s so hard , the fact , the fact , the fact , I think is that the <unk> of things like <unk> .
I want to go with the words of a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , his <unk> was , he said , &quot; Well , he said , &quot; Well , that &apos;s a lot of human <unk> of human : <unk> , which is not <unk> , which are <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is not <unk> , &quot; <unk> , which is not <unk> <unk> ,
Thank you .
I want to start to <unk> when , children , <unk> with <unk> .
And I <unk> as <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> problems , and <unk> problems problems problems and <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> to the way that <unk> is in the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> from our <unk> , and <unk> , and I started to my <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> , and I started to <unk> , I started to use a computer , and if we use a computer that we &apos;re going to have a <unk> <unk> <unk> on a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> on a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
and <unk> our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that <unk> of <unk> to <unk> , building the building , building the building .
In a few words , a <unk> computer as a computer as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> computer as a computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , you can <unk> &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , and they have a <unk> <unk> .
But <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> , like <unk> , you can just <unk> .
The <unk> are the new example of a new <unk> of <unk> , <unk> information .
And then , you can see more <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and we can <unk> them , and we can <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m going to be simple .
This is <unk> for <unk> to show you for the video , if you &apos;re going to get into a <unk> , if you can <unk> on the other <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
If you <unk> them , you know what is is around .
If they &apos;re going to <unk> , you can <unk> and they can <unk> them .
If they &apos;re going to <unk> , you can <unk> and they can <unk> them .
They also <unk> their <unk> and <unk> .
We &apos;re going to <unk> that one of the interesting of the <unk> was to use <unk> on the data , to use a <unk> , to <unk> a <unk> as if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> and I can <unk> <unk> .
and I can <unk> for <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , where you &apos;re <unk> .
If you &apos;re going to be able to <unk> a little bit .
I &apos;m going to <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , where people can <unk> things , and <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a <unk> of <unk> that I do with a <unk> of <unk> .
So , we have a <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , every <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> in every <unk> , <unk> , <unk> every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , every <unk> <unk> <unk> , and as you <unk> <unk> on a <unk> .
And then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new <unk> .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the children <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> , I &apos;ve done in the way that I &apos;ve got a video .
They &apos;re very <unk> .
And one of the things of this kind of interesting things that is not to <unk> .
I just say , &quot; <unk> of words , &quot; and they know what do .
Here &apos;s other people who <unk> .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> more than right .
And actually wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It can <unk> new in the <unk> , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new in the <unk> , <unk> their <unk> .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now , he has a <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> !
So , <unk> and <unk> <unk> can <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> !
-- <unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with the <unk> , and you can <unk> .
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with the <unk> , and you can <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I &apos;ve got a <unk> of a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> , <unk> , for <unk> and <unk> .
The <unk> here &apos;s <unk> as <unk> as <unk> , and the <unk> .
<unk> of these has four <unk> , and you can use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
And I just just <unk> a <unk> &quot; and a <unk> . &quot;
This is that you can <unk> from , as the <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> to a <unk> , and then then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are <unk> as time and <unk> , and <unk> , which is <unk> to the whole of the whole .
It &apos;s like how to work .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> in two <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> in a series , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m going to take a <unk> .
<unk> : Now , I &apos;m going to be <unk> --
<unk> : And now , I &apos;m <unk> the <unk> <unk> to <unk> , so I can <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> : I can <unk> the whole whole <unk> of time .
<unk> : And now , we <unk> the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> .
<unk> : I can <unk> the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
And now , I can <unk> the whole whole <unk> <unk> on the <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
So , how you can see , my <unk> is to build new <unk> , and <unk> as our brain and <unk> .
And I &apos;ve been time to show you one of this , of this , and some of the <unk> that we are going to get out of the lab .
The <unk> that I want to <unk> is that is that new generation of <unk> to <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk> that we want to our world to our world .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m not see the now talk about all of you .
They &apos;re a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> but it &apos;s more than this , of course .
It &apos;s also the love and the <unk> of my life .
And I don &apos;t change that .
But , he said , something like this is <unk> in my life and in my life , and my career , which is to me to <unk> the whole of work .
The thing is I <unk> this book , this book called &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> <unk> , for a lot of reason , and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And the result is that <unk> in the <unk> , people like if I was <unk> like if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I &apos;m going to tell you all <unk> and say , &quot; I don &apos;t really have to do better ?
You don &apos;t have to talk about all of life can be able to <unk> all of a book that can <unk> ? &quot;
How do you can <unk> ? &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> , you know .
But it would go to , part of what I think about 20 years ago , when I was <unk> to say -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to say to be a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
<unk> to the same <unk> from <unk> .
And people said , &quot; I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t have to be able to be to be <unk> ?
You don &apos;t have to <unk> you ?
You don &apos;t have to do this <unk> for all of life that &apos;s not about it . And you never have to <unk> a <unk> of <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
You know , you know .
The answer is -- the answer to all of these questions is : &quot; <unk> . &quot;
You know , I &apos;ve got all of those things .
I always always had to be <unk> .
And I also <unk> many things that people don &apos;t <unk> .
As the <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , for how do I thought I thought , and I think I would <unk> and <unk> is why ?
Is it ?
It &apos;s <unk> that you could <unk> <unk> of <unk> to be <unk> to be <unk> to do .
But what there is a particular way in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
How do my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I don &apos;t know a few years in his <unk> , which was asked to be <unk> ?
Do you never -- that <unk> of John <unk> , how do ?
You don &apos;t <unk> so , <unk> ?
<unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> as they don &apos;t have , in <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We have enough enough , we have enough , and not only <unk> , but it &apos;s not just <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I don &apos;t look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , just in the <unk> century , and often <unk> to them .
And also those who are not <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> , before I was <unk> in the last <unk> said , &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> me , &quot; <unk> a little bit more than to life .
But I don &apos;t <unk> when I &apos;m going to say , because we &apos;ve heard these things that in some way we have <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> all here is : you &apos;re all of this idea ?
I &apos;m going to do you this -- because I also <unk> from a <unk> of me to me .
I think it &apos;s <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s also <unk> and I want to <unk> in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better than our <unk> <unk> <unk> to live .
And I know , in my case -- in my <unk> -- would be very <unk> to <unk> that <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> ,
<unk> -- you look at , I &apos;m not <unk> , about 40 years .
I still have about four <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s very <unk> that any thing is that you can be <unk> from the world as the work that <unk> after my work .
<unk> , because we &apos;re all more or less , is that my <unk> is that my <unk> is that my <unk> is to my <unk> .
Oh , I think , what you do !
You know , this is the <unk> of <unk> that is to start to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
I want to do this work . I love .
So , the question is , how do ?
And so I think , after a lot of <unk> , which is to work to <unk> to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ?
I have to find a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , which I &apos;m <unk> , and my <unk> on what we &apos;re going to get to <unk> what he <unk> to get to the <unk> of how to look at how to look at the time , we look at the <unk> of the <unk> , and my ideas to see if we can see the <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> ,
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> me to <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> because they <unk> in <unk> and then <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> -- people don &apos;t believe that the <unk> of men , OK ?
It &apos;s <unk> that <unk> is this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> that <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> . &quot;
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The same idea of the same idea , but <unk> that species of the <unk> of the body .
The <unk> is , because the <unk> <unk> doesn &apos;t really really <unk> that a <unk> was really <unk> .
I &apos;m going to <unk> that a <unk> of <unk> that you <unk> in the <unk> of a <unk> , a <unk> , a little bit like <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the work .
<unk> : The <unk> is the <unk> of which I talk about that -- that <unk> you &apos;re going to be <unk> .
And all of it was so that <unk> , right ?
So the <unk> were <unk> by things , like , as well , as well , no , no ?
If your work was not <unk> <unk> <unk> all of <unk> , all of <unk> , all that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If your work is not all of you , you know , you know ?
All that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a lot of time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and all of <unk> , and <unk> this idea ; we have the human beings of the universe and <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of the universe and the <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and people who are <unk> to think that <unk> is <unk> by <unk> .
And for the first time in history , you have to <unk> this or the <unk> , like a <unk> that , like a <unk> that &apos;s <unk> to a <unk> that &apos;s <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think that was a little bit of <unk> .
I think I think about somebody , a simple person to think about how to be a <unk> as a <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s like to say to somebody else .
<unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> all of these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think that was <unk> to <unk> the <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> .
And if this is , and I think that &apos;s , and I think about it , and ?
Can we do that ?
<unk> to go back to a <unk> <unk> of human beings and <unk> .
Or maybe you don &apos;t .
Maybe we can &apos;t <unk> 500 years of <unk> in a talk about a talk about a talk about .
And probably there &apos;s people between the audience that <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> , <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of their projects .
It doesn &apos;t <unk> you all about this thing .
But the question I &apos;d like to <unk> is -- why don &apos;t ?
Why don &apos;t we <unk> in this way ?
Because he has more sense of every thing that ever heard for the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A process that , like that you ever <unk> to do something -- so , so , all of here -- so , all of it , you don &apos;t <unk> .
And , in fact , you can <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ve done this <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> , who has been a <unk> for all of life , but that was a <unk> <unk> for life and said , he said , &quot; <unk> in his <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , if you <unk> , and <unk> , if you have a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And he said that it was like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> <unk> to her <unk> .
<unk> , because they <unk> , because they <unk> the Earth .
I &apos;m going to have a single thing to do that point and was , &quot; <unk> like a <unk> . &quot;
And so I could go to house and <unk> , and it would not to this <unk> , and it would not to take a piece of <unk> and a <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And he doesn &apos;t <unk> enough to be enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> it would <unk> to <unk> , and he would <unk> , and she would <unk> , as she said , &quot; And she said , &quot; You know , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; and <unk> , &quot;
And then there were those times -- this piece of never -- there were never -- there were no <unk> , there was almost <unk> ,
So , was <unk> to house and was trying to be <unk> and <unk> to <unk> , and <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , and then he said , and then he said , he said , &quot; Well , and then the other <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> in his body and <unk> on the <unk> .
And in these <unk> , the <unk> <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> and <unk> , but the last <unk> , the last last last last last last <unk> .
So when I <unk> -- is <unk> -- is <unk> , is exactly the <unk> .
I don &apos;t all my process -- I &apos;m not a <unk> !
I &apos;m a <unk> , and my <unk> is ; we <unk> in the same <unk> every day and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But even I even in my <unk> , I &apos;ve got to <unk> that , and times .
And I also <unk> that many of you &apos;re going to do .
You know , if the ideas and ideas , and ideas , I could <unk> <unk> .
And what is ?
And how can we <unk> to do that in the way , but , but it &apos;s a lot , but , it &apos;s a lot , you know , you know , how do we <unk> ?
For me , I &apos;m going to tell me , I &apos;ve got to <unk> <unk> , the which I &apos;ve got different years ago for a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to talk about this , and you know , to <unk> , for life is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , trying to <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> these species of <unk> .
But then , you <unk> , and a day was a day , and then he was <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> all .
<unk> and all of a <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a little bit of <unk> , which is in his head as the <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and the <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , but it &apos;s a <unk> , but it &apos;s a <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> ,
It doesn &apos;t have a piece of <unk> , not a <unk> .
So , I &apos;m going to <unk> this species of <unk> in him , &quot; I &apos;m going to get to <unk> and <unk> <unk> from this <unk> .
I don &apos;t have enough to <unk> and I can &apos;t <unk> . &quot;
And instead of go into the <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> .
<unk> the whole process of <unk> and he was something completely new .
You just just <unk> the sky and said , &quot; You know , you see that I &apos;m not <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Do you know that you can tell you a <unk> ?
If you want to <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you can <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> today .
<unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And his process <unk> after this .
I don &apos;t work , the work was still <unk> as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when I was <unk> when you <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , where we could be <unk> , where it was not to be <unk> and what it was not to be <unk> and <unk> .
but I &apos;m going to <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> , and this thing is not <unk> .
So how I &apos;m going to change that story is to change a little bit of the way that I &apos;ve got a little bit .
This idea , I was when I was <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , and <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> that we &apos;re working on something that we &apos;re working on something that we &apos;re not going to be able to be able to be able to be to be <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t only <unk> , right .
And I think about <unk> this project .
But then I <unk> to <unk> that <unk> in the air and <unk> .
So I <unk> my <unk> on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> and <unk> my <unk> .
And I said , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , what is , we know if this book is not going to be <unk> , not ?
Because how you see I &apos;m going to see all that I &apos;ve got to see that .
So if you want to do , you need to do and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do , you know , what , you know , you know , it &apos;s nothing .
I &apos;m going to talk about the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to tell you that I &apos;m <unk> to do my <unk> for my part of my <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every <unk> , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> in fact , and one of these <unk> .
And I know what I &apos;m going to talk about why I know , because I know what you are all , a <unk> .
It was like if you <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> through a species of <unk> and it was not doing <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , as the <unk> , but it &apos;s all <unk> .
And we don &apos;t just like a human human .
But you <unk> from <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people who was , <unk> to his name .
<unk> hands and <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , when you &apos;re <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , this <unk> <unk> with their <unk> and <unk> <unk> in <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> you can you in your <unk> or you can &apos;t <unk> .
In <unk> , when a <unk> , he did something that is something that is something that .
And it &apos;s why we need to need .
But , the problem is the day , for the same day , when you go and <unk> and <unk> that are <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and maybe you can &apos;t <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
And maybe one <unk> of God , as you &apos;re going to do , and what do is to do with your life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But maybe not to be so <unk> if you &apos;re not going to believe , which is not to be <unk> , which is from your <unk> .
But I just just just <unk> data in <unk> , in a <unk> of this <unk> part of your life you have to <unk> when you have to <unk> when you have to <unk> when you have .
And you know , if we think about this way .
And so I started to <unk> , and it &apos;s like the <unk> , and it &apos;s like the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that I have to go to <unk> when I &apos;m going to <unk> when I &apos;m not not not going to be .
It doesn &apos;t just <unk> your work .
You can get to your part of your <unk> , you can be .
If your work is , you know , you know .
If you look at <unk> , you &apos;re going to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , to <unk> some kind of <unk> , then you just to your <unk> , then you &apos;re going to go to your <unk> . &quot;
You know , you do your <unk> .
And &quot; <unk> ! &quot; You know , you know .
I think there &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; You know , you also only to <unk> , even just for the human <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> : <unk> !
As I &apos;m already already talked about some of these projects on the human <unk> , and <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> .
Now , we &apos;re going to get a new <unk> of the work and now , and we &apos;re going to <unk> in a new new new <unk> , and <unk> .
We have to <unk> questions questions .
&quot; <unk> is something that ? &quot;
We have <unk> different <unk> , <unk> <unk> in terms .
We &apos;re <unk> from 20 years .
When we have the human <unk> of the human <unk> of the world of the <unk> of the computer .
Now , we can <unk> the life , or new life , or new ways ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , <unk> , which is the species of the species of the most small <unk> in the lab that can <unk> in the lab .
And we have to <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> to <unk> one .
We &apos;re able to <unk> a <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
But when we look at his map of his <unk> , is simple than our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one of the time , is very <unk> that can <unk> to a <unk> .
So I &apos;m going to <unk> that the only <unk> this <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of &quot; We can <unk> a <unk> ? &quot;
It can &apos;t <unk> these big <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re never never never been to create ?
And , in the case , we can <unk> a <unk> ?
It &apos;s just a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that we &apos;re able to <unk> the life is to <unk> .
Our <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , instead of <unk> , instead of <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> .
And our most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We have <unk> more years ago .
The process has many <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> before .
But we found that <unk> of DNA is very hard .
There are <unk> of thousands of <unk> in the world that <unk> <unk> in <unk> of <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> : the <unk> <unk> is <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , there are <unk> .
So we had to <unk> a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> .
And this is our first <unk> , in our first <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a little <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
We have <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of <unk> .
The interesting part is when we have this piece of <unk> <unk> and we have <unk> in the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> are <unk> <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> from cells , they &apos;re <unk> and they have <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ve talked about the <unk> <unk> <unk> that they have been <unk> that they have to <unk> this model .
They have <unk> more than you .
And I think that &apos;s a situation that &apos;s a very build the same <unk> in a system .
But I <unk> things in the big things in great .
<unk> to build the whole <unk> of <unk> .
They &apos;re more <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we thought about <unk> in <unk> of the size of the <unk> of the <unk> of a <unk> .
The <unk> is , and if you <unk> information with information in a computer , to be very <unk> .
When I &apos;m going to be <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We found that , <unk> , 30 , <unk> if we used that <unk> <unk> never been able to do it .
One of the process is <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> that you are <unk> to <unk> <unk> to build <unk> <unk> to build more <unk> than <unk> .
<unk> <unk> here .
You have to <unk> that there &apos;s <unk> .
<unk> so we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> on four <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , and there &apos;s about 20 <unk> , and there is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
So we can use the <unk> to <unk> words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we have to the beginning of the beginning was <unk> .
Some of they have been <unk> from the fact that was not <unk> .
We have these <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them <unk> them .
And we started to <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
And we &apos;re going to have these <unk> in <unk> so <unk> that we &apos;re <unk> <unk> to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> as you &apos;ll see a minute .
We &apos;re trying to <unk> the process .
So , this is <unk> of a <unk> of <unk> .
When I &apos;m going to <unk> these very <unk> , more than 100 <unk> , not <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> to <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
So we have to <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
That &apos;s a example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> <unk> ,
You can see in the <unk> as his <unk> as his <unk> .
In 12 hours -- it &apos;s <unk> , as before was before .
<unk> thousands of <unk> that are able to do that .
This is a <unk> of <unk> .
We live in <unk> .
They &apos;re not sure that life in space , and you &apos;re <unk> to find new <unk> .
And I mean , the <unk> <unk> has <unk> that this is .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we &apos;ve built these <unk> , just by the <unk> <unk> with design .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> .
These are <unk> that <unk> a time of about six about six seconds .
This is the <unk> that we &apos;ve done a little bit ago .
They &apos;re more <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s the most <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It has a <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
If you &apos;re going to <unk> a <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s only <unk> <unk> .
Now , how do we do this ?
<unk> , a <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a little bit more <unk> when they use of the <unk> .
It &apos;s more simple when you &apos;re going to be <unk> to how our : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> a <unk> , which is the <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
In <unk> <unk> the <unk> is instead of <unk> in the <unk> , but we <unk> that we &apos;re able to do a <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We have a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The two are different than men from <unk> .
We have some <unk> in the way to <unk> that we can <unk> to <unk> this .
The <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , <unk> all of <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we have in the <unk> in the <unk> of our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> .
And we <unk> that not go to <unk> , but we have to <unk> it in there .
This is one of the <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species , they <unk> a third or a third <unk> in a few of new <unk> in a new <unk> of new species .
So , who think about how to talk a <unk> , which is not <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the <unk> , no one .
The <unk> that we have <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , and he <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> as <unk> as <unk> , and we &apos;re <unk> with the new <unk> and the new <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> to be <unk> .
And in a long time , all the <unk> of time , all of a species are you to <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> of all , <unk> on the new species , on the new <unk> that we have in the new <unk> in the new species .
All of the <unk> are <unk> , <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
Now , this may be <unk> <unk> , but <unk> the <unk> of DNA , we can change things in a <unk> .
Now , I already already <unk> that here is not about <unk> -- but of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and I &apos;ve already already said that we &apos;re already , and I already said that we &apos;re already <unk> in new <unk> of new <unk> <unk> ,
Why do what do ?
I think that &apos;s enough when we think about our <unk> .
We &apos;re going to go to six billion and <unk> in the next next 40 years .
<unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> in the <unk> ; there are four years , there .
We &apos;re <unk> problems in <unk> , water and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> for six billion people .
We still have more <unk> to do that for <unk> .
<unk> <unk> billion billion <unk> , more than <unk> billion <unk> .
That means that percent of <unk> <unk> .
When we &apos;re going to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process for <unk> , it &apos;s a challenge .
In the most <unk> of all of all of the <unk> that <unk> in the atmosphere .
So I think about <unk> <unk> <unk> in the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million <unk> , and I like to think that are the <unk> for the future .
The <unk> <unk> only one <unk> of <unk> , and think about how many different are <unk> .
Our <unk> here are data from the <unk> of the <unk> and our imagination .
Now , we have <unk> , thank you to <unk> <unk> of <unk> , in the <unk> of what we call <unk> .
We &apos;re able to build a <unk> <unk> that can <unk> a million <unk> .
Think of these <unk> <unk> , or <unk> of <unk> or <unk> to <unk> <unk> or <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , we can change , we can change , to create a little <unk> , and <unk> , we can change in the last 20 years .
And it &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> .
We can <unk> for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some <unk> <unk> on the computer we &apos;re working on the computer , and we can <unk> and <unk> species .
Well , we don &apos;t know how to be .
We know what &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
Now we &apos;re going to <unk> on <unk> <unk> .
You &apos;ve seen you &apos;ve seen <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We have <unk> <unk> and third generation that <unk> enough , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> ,
But the only way that the model can have a big <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> would be <unk> the <unk> of the food and <unk> <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re working on the <unk> of the first generation of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> with the <unk> is a <unk> <unk> , but in our world , we have <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we have <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> in the ocean , about <unk> feet .
<unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> as well as energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can <unk> the CO2 , which can be <unk> <unk> , <unk> that <unk> <unk> in <unk> , to <unk> this process .
So , we think that we could be able to be able to <unk> what the question of the question of the question that is , &quot; We have the whole <unk> <unk> , the whole <unk> of <unk> ,
You can &apos;t do it . If you can do it ?
It &apos;s a <unk> of energy .
<unk> , we &apos;re working for use <unk> <unk> .
You &apos;ve seen this year with <unk> , we were always <unk> to find a year and a year in the <unk> .
I think that you can change <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
That &apos;s how the future may be able to be <unk> , the <unk> of the evolution of the evolution , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> .
We &apos;re going to be so much people .
Our <unk> is to do that in the way to live in <unk> to <unk> . Thank you very much . Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
<unk> , I &apos;m going to see , I &apos;m going to see , some of the new technology that we have to <unk> a year ago , we have to <unk> a year ago . This is . This is . This is . This is . This is . This is . This is <unk> . This is . This is . This is <unk> . This is <unk> . This is . This is .
It &apos;s a environment that you can <unk> is to <unk> that you can <unk> a lot of data that we &apos;re going to <unk> .
Here we &apos;re seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , for a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much is the <unk> of information that we see , how much these <unk> data or the <unk> .
Most of <unk> , but this is a <unk> <unk> , but this is a <unk> <unk> from <unk> , and <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t be a difference because the only thing that <unk> is the number of a system like this is the number of your screen in any screen . It &apos;s also a very <unk> .
This is a book , of course , in the data .
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> .
For <unk> that &apos;s just about <unk> and not <unk> , we can do a thing about , we can do a <unk> thing that is a <unk> of <unk> , not a <unk> of <unk> , not a <unk> of a <unk> .
It could be a little bit of <unk> to read a book .
I don &apos;t want to tell you .
This is a <unk> example of it . It &apos;s a number of a number of the <unk> .
Every image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And I really really think the <unk> experience and the experience of <unk> .
We have something with the <unk> of this number of this number of <unk> .
We &apos;ve created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , very much more than that you have a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or other , or even <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas for <unk> ,
<unk> that <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , not <unk> .
Now , you know , the <unk> <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this is not going to know , if we don &apos;t know , we have to <unk> to <unk> that .
These are all the <unk> in the U.S. <unk> on a <unk> .
So now I &apos;m going to do something else .
This is actually <unk> from the <unk> ; you can see .
It &apos;s a project called <unk> , which is two different <unk> .
One is a <unk> <unk> of the computer is a <unk> <unk> to <unk> , one of the <unk> , one of the <unk> of <unk> , with <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , which we can <unk> to a picture of the other <unk> and that kind of experience .
But the <unk> <unk> of <unk> here has actually actually actually actually <unk> a sense .
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> these <unk> <unk> , in the way that <unk> <unk> <unk> all the <unk> <unk> <unk> all the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and these things are <unk> , and these things are <unk> , and all of these things are <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m going to show you some other environment .
There are some more <unk> <unk> .
I want to go to one of the <unk> of <unk> and this is <unk> <unk> , and this is <unk> <unk> that we have to work for the first time to show you what is really , for you know , the key technology , the key technology is not so much of the <unk> that we have to <unk> in the <unk> .
We had to <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in other <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So I &apos;m all of <unk> <unk> <unk> and they &apos;re all <unk> on this way .
And it &apos;s possible to this way .
You know , I never thought about <unk> to work to work .
It &apos;s very <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think I think that you &apos;re going to see that is a lot of different <unk> of <unk> : <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> a <unk> <unk> , <unk> together .
And if I can , I &apos;m going to go to to <unk> those <unk> .
Thank you very much <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> here is a series of <unk> --
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can <unk> from the <unk> of this environment .
The point is that we can do things with the social environment . This is now <unk> data from the whole <unk> of how to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> <unk> , and all of the <unk> of the data .
All of those <unk> <unk> together , <unk> together .
You have a model of the whole of the whole of the whole of the whole model that .
Think about this as a <unk> of work on Earth .
It &apos;s something that <unk> in <unk> , which people <unk> , and the <unk> that <unk> to the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If somebody else is the idea of all of these <unk> <unk> <unk> , my name , my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I can use how to use of the <unk> , in that <unk> , and I can use of the <unk> , and I can have a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> .
Now , a <unk> of all of what are <unk> is <unk> in the Earth , <unk> <unk> , <unk> not only to <unk> and <unk> <unk> from <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , but from <unk> .
<unk> .
CA : How do you know ? What do your <unk> is that your <unk> us to do is that in the next , in the next years , all the next years , all of the world would be able to be able to be <unk> to be <unk> ?
<unk> : Yes . That &apos;s what &apos;s doing is doing .
It &apos;s <unk> , if you want to <unk> , between <unk> .
And it &apos;s doing that in the <unk> of the <unk> .
The thing is , if you think about <unk> information that is that many of these <unk> .
As you &apos;re a <unk> <unk> of <unk> on the <unk> , you &apos;re going to be a <unk> and the <unk> on the <unk> .
Now , what happens if that picture of all the <unk> ?
So the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> that <unk> is really a lot of the network . It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
CA : <unk> , it &apos;s really incredible <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> you .
One of the <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> of the <unk> is to live in the <unk> , who has <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , who are the <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
And I think that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> , which is the idea that we have a <unk> of the world , but the world is , there , there is a <unk> , but that is , but the <unk> , there ,
And the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> that our <unk> has done , or <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> , <unk> a lot of <unk> .
And of course , all of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
All of <unk> . <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> to <unk> .
We have to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , so we don &apos;t <unk> if you &apos;re not going to get it and <unk> --
We all have a art .
What <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of every <unk> of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> or <unk> , <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
He was my <unk> to <unk> in the <unk> of a month , or a month , or a <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , <unk> on the world .
All of these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of <unk> ways of <unk> ways , other ways of ways , to <unk> in the world .
And if you could <unk> a moment , is a <unk> that can you .
<unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> that is <unk> the planet and it is important for the <unk> of the planet as the planet as the planet as the <unk> as the planet as the planet as the planet as the planet as the planet as the planet as the planet as the planet as the planet as the planet as the planet of life as the planet as the planet as the planet as the world as the world as the planet as the planet as the <unk> as the <unk> as the world as the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in human <unk> .
The <unk> is the <unk> of <unk> .
It &apos;s the <unk> of what we &apos;re in and what we can be in how much species .
And they <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> to <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , for example , <unk> that <unk> percent of all the species of all of all the species is about <unk> because it &apos;s <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and you can &apos;t have to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of all of that is , <unk> <unk> .
When you &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
One of the language is not only to a <unk> or a series of rules .
One language is the <unk> of the human <unk> .
It &apos;s the <unk> with the which is the <unk> of every culture in the world .
Every language is a <unk> <unk> of the mind , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we &apos;re here in <unk> , at least in the <unk> of the children .
They don &apos;t have to <unk> children , which means , you know , you know , you know , that are already <unk> .
What is there &apos;s more <unk> of <unk> <unk> , to be <unk> from the last language of a language , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> is the <unk> of any of every two weeks : every two weeks : every weeks : every weeks of <unk> and <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
And I know somebody else is not better ?
The world doesn &apos;t have a better place if we all <unk> the same language ? &quot;
<unk> .
<unk> a <unk> thing that means that I don &apos;t want to talk about the language .
I &apos;d like to do you to do a <unk> to --
So , I &apos;m going to give you a <unk> of what we &apos;re <unk> .
And many of us when I say when I say , &quot; I &apos;m really really really different ways of <unk> .
<unk> for example , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> that doesn &apos;t <unk> the <unk> of the blue <unk> , because the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> , which is <unk> in the <unk> .
They have a language of <unk> and a <unk> , &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; : &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> ,
All of it has in the past , <unk> , <unk> is that in these <unk> that are not or seven or seven or seven <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> to <unk> and then <unk> to talk about .
I &apos;m going to be interesting interesting , the <unk> of what I &apos;ve been , a <unk> <unk> that has been <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
In five <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They have done by the <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> , which <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They have <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , they have to <unk> to <unk> a <unk> or a <unk> , and not <unk> , they <unk> that <unk> <unk> , and they have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> doesn &apos;t only <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> between their <unk> .
The <unk> percent of <unk> was <unk> by their <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> to eight <unk> and we found two of <unk> in the <unk> and when we <unk> a <unk> that one of them was so <unk> that is so that &apos;s so that &apos;s <unk> , and then they <unk> <unk> , and then they have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then they had a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> were able to <unk> the <unk> <unk> of 40 <unk> , and <unk> species .
I &apos;ve been <unk> in the <unk> , I was <unk> a really interesting <unk> to me , and I wanted to go to <unk> me to <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
For a sense of <unk> , I could actually , I had to understand the culture , and that <unk> is not <unk> .
It &apos;s pretty <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> of the world .
It &apos;s interesting .
If you &apos;re going to tell you you about the <unk> of the world , what do ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
A <unk> is always <unk> out , I think about Africa , which is not <unk> . And the instead of the <unk> is not the other <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What &apos;s what it &apos;s the <unk> is the <unk> of life and <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> can be <unk> from <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> in the way to <unk> .
For this <unk> <unk> <unk> to say , &quot; <unk> you go to <unk> to me to me .
We <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re <unk> , is the <unk> that you can &apos;t you to you ?
So you &apos;re <unk> to these <unk> : <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> with which I &apos;ve been <unk> the most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> that one time <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> in <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> of <unk> , this <unk> never been <unk> by <unk> .
<unk> today are <unk> from a <unk> <unk> , but their <unk> is <unk> .
The <unk> are <unk> on the <unk> <unk> , or four years , and <unk> <unk> in a world of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> to the <unk> .
Two years of <unk> years of <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of the months of <unk> that <unk> in the mother , <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
For all this time , they &apos;re <unk> to <unk> with their <unk> , which <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> -- or <unk> , to say , <unk> <unk> .
And then , the <unk> <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> out of the first time , in their life , in their life , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , when the sun is <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and then <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , and he said ,
&quot; <unk> ? &quot; <unk> as I said ,
It &apos;s <unk> . Now , you know . &quot;
They call <unk> <unk> in the world and say that we are , <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> <unk> ,
This is very important .
When we think about <unk> and <unk> in <unk> environment , and the story of the story of the <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> in his <unk> or maybe we say that these are <unk> to us to us .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
There &apos;s no space for these things in <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> , but <unk> <unk> <unk> , but <unk> , <unk> , but <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , but <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> that can only one of the Earth , because of the <unk> , because of the <unk> is <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
What does say ?
I mean , which is a <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> that <unk> is a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s a human <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> a different <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> a <unk> that &apos;s <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> of a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
That &apos;s the <unk> of a <unk> or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What is the interesting is the <unk> that <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> .
I &apos;m <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
What I &apos;ve got a human different <unk> from my friends that <unk> are <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you &apos;re going to create these <unk> can create a different <unk> , to <unk> some of them .
I <unk> this picture of <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk> , the most <unk> <unk> .
What it &apos;s really <unk> is not the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , but his <unk> .
<unk> , this <unk> <unk> that <unk> is <unk> that <unk> is a series of <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> is a little bit of a little <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> with a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> , very , very , very , very <unk> , <unk> .
If you ever see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> that <unk> is that <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like to be <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , the man who has <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> in his <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
And the <unk> <unk> , you can &apos;t tell these <unk> like , because if you &apos;re not going to be <unk> .
It &apos;s possible to <unk> if you could only <unk> if you &apos;re going to <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
Now , it &apos;s the good <unk> that are <unk> in this <unk> are <unk> of <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> . The question of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , in a <unk> of <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , but <unk> of these two <unk> , but if we &apos;re going to do , if you have to <unk> , you &apos;re going to do is that is <unk> .
We use the big <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , which can <unk> .
But if you <unk> to <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know . &quot;
What does say ?
This <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> in the <unk> , and our eyes .
If you look like <unk> their <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the <unk> , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : <unk> <unk> <unk> in a night of <unk> and <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
With that you don &apos;t have to <unk> , but it &apos;s very interesting that <unk> .
Now , you know , the problem is that also those of us that have to <unk> them <unk> them , but in some way of our <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and more .
In fact , the century , between <unk> , <unk> , not <unk> to <unk> or his <unk> or his <unk> , but it was like the <unk> , but as the <unk> was as the <unk> of the <unk> of the planet , and <unk> of the planet . Now , we have to change the <unk> of the <unk> . Now , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . Now ,
All of the <unk> <unk> were <unk> in a new <unk> for life .
And the problem is not the technology .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> , they <unk> <unk> when they <unk> when they <unk> <unk> and <unk> as the <unk> as they <unk> as they <unk> <unk> , and <unk> .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the power .
The <unk> <unk> .
And if you &apos;re going to get a <unk> in the world , which are not <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> and <unk> <unk> out of <unk> from <unk> , which are <unk> to their <unk> .
<unk> that you &apos;re <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
And we <unk> in <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that has <unk> in the <unk> to the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> to <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are <unk> <unk> .
If you <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I &apos;m doing many <unk> , you &apos;ll see the <unk> of <unk> .
As I <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> of a <unk> , is <unk> to <unk> , but the <unk> , <unk> of life , but the <unk> of life , <unk> , not only <unk> , but it &apos;s not only <unk> , because of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> .
And you can understand the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
I &apos;ve got to <unk> miles in China China , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , but only <unk> to <unk> , but only what I just <unk> is the <unk> that &apos;s <unk> <unk> that &apos;s the <unk> of <unk> that &apos;s going to talk about .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> <unk> .
The father &apos;s <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that means that was <unk> to the time of the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk> .
It was actually <unk> <unk> in <unk> in <unk> <unk> in his <unk> , and he would be able to be able to be able to be <unk> .
The same <unk> , which is the same , is <unk> in <unk> .
A day has <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and , and this <unk> , was <unk> to work for <unk> to work for seven years .
The <unk> of <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> of the <unk> is <unk> .
And then , all of all of it <unk> to a choice .
<unk> in the world &apos;s <unk> or we want to <unk> the world of <unk> ?
The big <unk> <unk> , before I first had to say that his <unk> was , which is that his <unk> , in our <unk> , and not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination , but we <unk> the whole <unk> of human <unk> , but we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , but we had a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s <unk> to <unk> that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , which has <unk> <unk> , which has been <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we &apos;re talking about <unk> , and we &apos;re talking about <unk> .
The world has <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
The story I don &apos;t <unk> me that we have the <unk> to <unk> in <unk> .
When I think of these <unk> <unk> of the world is to say , we &apos;re going to say , <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s in these <unk> that we all <unk> the <unk> of what we &apos;re going to to get to to to <unk> and all the <unk> of all the <unk> and all the <unk> of all of them . And that are <unk> .
I <unk> this picture of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> , and this man , he <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The government <unk> is not always <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> , and in the <unk> <unk> , we have <unk> to our <unk> , we have <unk> in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
The family , <unk> for his life , <unk> all of <unk> , and all his <unk> .
They &apos;re going to know that <unk> is not going to be the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the <unk> were <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn &apos;t have <unk> from <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , you know , you know , <unk> in <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did <unk> <unk> , he <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It has <unk> on <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> of <unk> and when you <unk> , he <unk> a <unk> .
It has <unk> the <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> has <unk> a <unk> , has a <unk> <unk> , has a <unk> <unk> and it &apos;s <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : How do you do ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> together .
It &apos;s the new <unk> . It &apos;s called <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . <unk> all the <unk> of the <unk> .
One of the <unk> of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , for <unk> , I think is pretty <unk> at least who was in these <unk> <unk> , which is in these <unk> , which is not all of the planet , that &apos;s not <unk> .
For somebody is house .
<unk> of human imagination that <unk> in the <unk> of the time that we all , the <unk> of these children , how to <unk> our <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of our <unk> .
For us , we &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> never <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> --
<unk> <unk> , but we think that the stories can change the world , and maybe the best <unk> to tell stories about stories about stories about the world .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> from people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to <unk> our audience in places , in places of <unk> from what they &apos;ve seen on how they &apos;ve seen and <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in the world , and we have to find a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a world , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a world .
which is the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> our <unk> .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I hope to talk about other <unk> that I hope you &apos;ve heard about some <unk> <unk> , in the case that I don &apos;t have to some <unk> .
I want to start with what I call the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
<unk> <unk> ?
The <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : &quot; If we want to <unk> our <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
The reason is , from one side , in fact , in fact that the <unk> is , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to human beings .
And I &apos;m going to do that if we &apos;re <unk> , all of us to do to do that , for all of what we &apos;re going to do our <unk> , which is not our name .
The way to <unk> the <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> people have more <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> , and more <unk> , and the <unk> , is their <unk> .
This is so <unk> in the society that one of the society that one you &apos;re <unk> in <unk> .
And it &apos;s also <unk> in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what the <unk> is possible .
This is my <unk> . It &apos;s not really big .
I &apos;m going to be simple on <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> <unk> , <unk> , without <unk> <unk> , without 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> that you can <unk> that you can get to you to you a lot of <unk> that one of your <unk> <unk> .
That &apos;s the <unk> .
And then you go to the <unk> <unk> to <unk> one : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> of <unk> , there is a big number of <unk> .
We can do that million <unk> and <unk> of different <unk> that there are a only <unk> .
<unk> <unk> that there is another <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : the world &apos;s <unk> .
One time , when I was a child , they could get all the <unk> , to <unk> <unk> that they were <unk> to <unk> .
You know , the phone , you don &apos;t <unk> .
One of what , between the other , was that the <unk> never .
This is about times .
Now , we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> .
That &apos;s the future .
My <unk> is what is in the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
If you &apos;re not seen the <unk> in the house , you &apos;re <unk> in the house , you &apos;re going to be <unk> .
And what &apos;s going to end is that people are <unk> in the <unk> and that question is the answer is ? The answer is ? &quot;
It &apos;s not just a <unk> that doesn &apos;t do it .
So , in other <unk> of life that are very important than <unk> , <unk> <unk> the same <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , not the United States in the United States , you &apos;re <unk> <unk> , and you want to do .
And , I &apos;m going to <unk> , and you , &quot; OK , we could do , &quot; or &quot; <unk> , or &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , and <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
You know , &quot; <unk> , what do ? &quot;
And the <unk> says , &quot; In this <unk> , and <unk> these <unk> , and <unk> these <unk> . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you &apos;re going to say , &quot; You know , what ? &quot;
And the <unk> , &quot; But I &apos;m not she . &quot;
The <unk> we call &quot; <unk> <unk> of &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> that <unk> is a <unk> .
But actually , it &apos;s not that one <unk> the <unk> and <unk> of <unk> : <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , to somebody who <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> that doesn &apos;t even though -- and <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> , and in the <unk> of the <unk> .
There &apos;s a huge <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> people like me and you , you know , it &apos;s not sense , which we can &apos;t <unk> .
But if we can &apos;t <unk> , because there are <unk> them ?
The answer is that I want to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re going to be so much as our <unk> is a question of , like you see in this <unk> , like you can &apos;t want to <unk> the <unk> of them to the <unk> . &quot; We don &apos;t want to have to have to <unk> . &quot; We have to have to have to <unk> . &quot;
And we can <unk> how many times we &apos;re going to be <unk> .
The means that every <unk> , to <unk> , you have to do .
And I was at the <unk> , a time , a time , <unk> , almost <unk> that you would have to be able to <unk> , and you <unk> , and you <unk> , you can <unk> the <unk> , you can <unk> .
The only one of the only one of the who don &apos;t even know what I don &apos;t do .
<unk> , all is really to play .
<unk> , in the students , and they <unk> their <unk> percent of <unk> in a time .
And why are not <unk> , because they &apos;re not <unk> .
But why are you , <unk> <unk> to <unk> , &quot; <unk> or don &apos;t do it ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> me ? I think about ? I think about the kids or ? &quot;
They &apos;re <unk> .
And they &apos;re going to be able to be able to answer this <unk> doesn &apos;t <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and not to get a <unk> <unk> .
And they have to do that . I &apos;m <unk> questions .
Now , the work : we &apos;re <unk> , as <unk> , because the technology is <unk> , because the technology , every day , from every day , <unk> of the planet , <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> , and I don &apos;t want to what you , where the <unk> is .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use .
What does , this is <unk> of the <unk> that we have to work about is that we have to work , in every moment , if we need to work or not .
We can go to see our son to <unk> , with the <unk> in a <unk> , the <unk> in the other <unk> , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And even if they &apos;re all <unk> , every minute , we see the <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re also <unk> , we &apos;re also <unk> , we &apos;re going to do this called &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve got to answer this <unk> ? &quot;
And when the answer is , &quot; Well , this is not &quot; , this is not to your body .
So , from any part of things , and big , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> of life , life is a <unk> of <unk> .
One time was this : <unk> , there were some of the <unk> , but it was not a question of the <unk> .
The world of <unk> today today is : The <unk> is : &quot; <unk> , &quot; Is it a <unk> thing ? &quot;
The answer is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> them , so I &apos;m going to talk about those <unk> .
<unk> this , two <unk> , two <unk> people .
The first , <unk> , is that you &apos;re going to <unk> .
With many <unk> in which is <unk> , very difficult to do it .
I &apos;ll tell you a <unk> example of <unk> on <unk> .
A <unk> has been <unk> to <unk> data , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , with about <unk> <unk> <unk> in different <unk> .
What she has discovered that is that for every 10 <unk> that are <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
With 50 <unk> , there &apos;s 10 percent of <unk> in less than when they &apos;re just <unk> to when they &apos;re just going to be <unk> .
Because we &apos;re going to <unk> in which is , is hard to <unk> , and the <unk> is <unk> to <unk> .
And they &apos;re still <unk> , and still <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , and of course , and <unk> , and <unk> <unk> ,
I &apos;m not just like this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> , because it doesn &apos;t want to say that the <unk> is so that the <unk> is so that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re not <unk> to five <unk> to five <unk> for <unk> year , which would be <unk> to <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> to have to <unk> .
And I think that &apos;s the world as the world .
&quot; And for <unk> , for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
You know , if you &apos;re going to take the right ?
It doesn &apos;t want to <unk> the wrong wrong , and <unk> the wrong .
So this is the first <unk> . The second is that if we can <unk> the <unk> and <unk> to do the end of how we &apos;re going to be <unk> from how to do we have to <unk> that the <unk> of how to do .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many <unk> in which is , if you &apos;re going to <unk> a <unk> and it &apos;s not to do a different way that would be able to do a different way that we could do a different <unk> , which is that we <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> ,
It also when it was a <unk> .
<unk> us , there are more <unk> , is <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
<unk> , there &apos;s what the <unk> called <unk> .
So , <unk> , very well as well as the <unk> things that we are going to do things that with the <unk> .
And then , when there are many <unk> , is so much , is <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> that is <unk> .
That &apos;s a example . I &apos;m not <unk> with all of the <unk> .
But it &apos;s what probably <unk> .
There &apos;s this <unk> to <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> . <unk> day . It &apos;s all of them .
It doesn &apos;t <unk> . But that he &apos;s think , &quot; Well , it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; All right . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> in front of the house . &quot;
And then , in the idea that is <unk> -- every day -- the <unk> of <unk> where you want to <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> , which we have , even when we have , when we have ,
And the most <unk> that we have <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s another example .
This <unk> us .
There &apos;s about to live in the moment , and maybe of the <unk> .
But the most important is that any thing is that any thing , you &apos;re not going to do other .
The things that doesn &apos;t <unk> many <unk> that can do less <unk> what we do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ve got on my <unk> <unk> a new <unk> .
<unk> always <unk> .
One time the time were <unk> , and <unk> them , and <unk> , they were <unk> , they were only after <unk> a lot of life , and <unk> a lot of times , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> to go to the <unk> .
So , I &apos;m going to <unk> a new <unk> , and I said , &quot; I need to do a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> said , &quot; What would you want to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
Do you want to <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; How do you want to do ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> ? <unk> <unk> -- &quot; <unk> <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a little bit of , I was to say , &quot; I want to say , &quot; I was not the only idea that was not to me , and then it &apos;s so that was , then I was not going to <unk> , then , then I was <unk> , and then I had never <unk> .
It was the <unk> .
But I &apos;m going to be <unk> .
Why ? I said , I &apos;ve got a whole book for <unk> .
The reason I was that I was that with all of my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I had to <unk> <unk> . I don &apos;t <unk> me when I &apos;m just a kind of <unk> when we &apos;re going to do something like , we &apos;re going to be able to be , at least .
And what I was good , but I was not good .
After I was <unk> what I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in life of people who are not <unk> that these <unk> are <unk> to <unk> .
And this <unk> is less <unk> , even when the <unk> are good .
No one in the world of the <unk> if you do it .
Because if you &apos;re not going to <unk> , I &apos;m talking about what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more .
&quot; He was better when you was going to be able to do when you was better when you was , it &apos;s still as we had to be <unk> .
<unk> , in the world where we live -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> that we can <unk> is that we can <unk> things that we can <unk> .
You never <unk> because your <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> , <unk> are <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> -- what you &apos;re here -- is : &quot; <unk> &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes , &quot; Yes . &quot;
I mean -- I mean -- I &apos;m really <unk> -- that I &apos;m really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I don &apos;t know better , I don &apos;t do , I &apos;m not <unk> .
But I don &apos;t always always have a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> when there &apos;s only about <unk> when there is not just that kind of <unk> is that when you &apos;re not going to <unk> , and you &apos;re going to you ? &quot;
&quot; Who &apos;s <unk> ? &quot; &quot; Well , the answer is <unk> .
The world is the <unk> . What I could do ?
When there are hundreds of <unk> , and <unk> , and you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s <unk> that <unk> is <unk> that you &apos;re <unk> .
I could do better .
With hundreds of <unk> <unk> , there are not <unk> for <unk> .
So when people are <unk> <unk> , even if you &apos;re going to get <unk> and <unk> and <unk> them to their <unk> .
In the last years of the <unk> in the world .
I think that a <unk> <unk> -- not the only one , but -- -- this is not just that people have <unk> because they &apos;re going to be <unk> because they &apos;re <unk> because they &apos;re too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation is that the <unk> is their <unk> .
So the end of the <unk> is that in the world , but we <unk> , but we <unk> .
I &apos;m going to tell you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what all do is , and it &apos;s completely <unk> .
There &apos;s no <unk> that a little bit of a little bit of the best that doesn &apos;t <unk> .
There &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , <unk> . I don &apos;t know what is .
But I &apos;m not enough that we have <unk> from a piece of our life .
Now , from the point of <unk> -- I &apos;ve got to <unk> -- from the <unk> , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What that &apos;s all of the <unk> in the society is the <unk> .
There are many places in the world , and you &apos;re going to <unk> , in the problem that have no <unk> .
The problem is that we have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I &apos;m talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that &apos;s <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> , I &apos;m <unk> you to <unk> you . And it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I mean , these <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , it &apos;s not just <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> .
We do that .
If you &apos;re going to be a little bit of what in our society is in those where people have too much <unk> , it would not only be not only the <unk> , but our <unk> .
This is what the <unk> called <unk> <unk> .
One of the <unk> of <unk> -- not only about -- because of this is not only about this <unk> , which is <unk> .
For <unk> , you can be all of what you want to do . &quot;
<unk> , people , <unk> <unk> , <unk> : &quot; But what do is ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s <unk> that you can &apos;t make it in a <unk> of <unk> . &quot;
&quot; A <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> of the world --
and I <unk> , I <unk> so , in the beginning .
But then , I &apos;m going to me , I &apos;m going to be able to be .
Because the fact that is that if you <unk> in <unk> , in <unk> , in the way that is not going to be <unk> <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> in the way that we can <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
All they need a <unk> .
This is almost too <unk> , maybe , maybe even for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and <unk> , for <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
