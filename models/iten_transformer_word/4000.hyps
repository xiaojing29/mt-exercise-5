<unk> year I showed these <unk> for <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is almost three million years of <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> <unk> , is <unk> <unk> <unk> , is <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> is <unk> <unk> percent .
And I <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a sense , in a sense , the heart <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> on the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in the red .
As you see , you can see the blue <unk> .
That &apos;s the ice in <unk> , which <unk> <unk> summer .
You can see that the ice <unk> , five or more , it &apos;s like the <unk> , which here is <unk> from the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s so , in the past .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> around the ocean <unk> around the ocean , where there are huge amount of <unk> that , <unk> , <unk> are <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> this point of not <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , the <unk> is already <unk> by water .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : She &apos;s good . The question is if we <unk> <unk> .
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> never <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how <unk> <unk> <unk> to the sea <unk> on the sea <unk> , here is where the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> other part of the planet : <unk> , the biggest <unk> of the planet .
The month last month , <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , and which <unk> <unk> <unk> , and which <unk> <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> at <unk> feet of the <unk> , as in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the third <unk> of ice , you see the new <unk> , you see a few years ago , they were <unk> .
<unk> percent of the world &apos;s population <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : This is the source of <unk> water <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> .
But when I <unk> , the same happens to the water <unk> .
In California <unk> on the <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis .
<unk> , as you know , are <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the world to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the <unk> and without <unk> .
Sometimes we &apos;re going to be more <unk> in the last 30 years than <unk> .
This is a <unk> of all <unk> .
If you look at the context context , you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we <unk> <unk> million <unk> CO2 every day -- 25 million <unk> in every day .
Look at the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , from <unk> , and <unk> on both the parts of the <unk> <unk> , where there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the ocean .
The biggest <unk> of the global <unk> , and the <unk> , and that &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
The oil is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with the most <unk> <unk> .
And you <unk> to build a lot of <unk> other <unk> .
But we &apos;re <unk> to a <unk> direction .
These are the <unk> <unk> in the last few years and some <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And in every way , there &apos;s a <unk> politics in our country .
The <unk> of <unk> and oil <unk> <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year for <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I <unk> <unk> something --
<unk> <unk> , where live in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
Maybe you saw the <unk> on the <unk> .
This is the biggest <unk> of <unk> in America .
It &apos;s happened around <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> â™« <unk> <unk> is a <unk> like a <unk> and happy .
It &apos;s <unk> here in America , and it &apos;s going to be our economy .
<unk> the <unk> is always more <unk> .
It &apos;s about <unk> price , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , the <unk> here is the most <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
The biggest society <unk> on the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is the <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- not know what they &apos;re talking about .
<unk> : So , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> two <unk> .
This is a part of them , a part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> , we see the <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> to our business .
So , this is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> for public health and <unk> the truth and <unk> the truth on the truth .
In fact , the <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it &apos;s <unk> -- it &apos;s also a good <unk> .
So , not <unk> change the climate change .
We <unk> to do it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you &apos;ve heard about very much .
So I <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> for how about <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> : The machines are a little bit , but this is the sound of the technology of <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> is between the <unk> <unk> of global <unk> , but the technology of <unk> that you see all the <unk> of <unk> that you see everything .
And we look at this is the <unk> technology of <unk> .

If you want to go to , you go back , you go back , &quot;
We have to go back , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED I did a <unk> on the <unk> .
And I <unk> <unk> for <unk> about how the car works .
So , I &apos;m going to go . And for those who didn &apos;t have , the <unk> is the biggest experiment with <unk> .
<unk> is <unk> the conditions that were in the <unk> that were in the beginning of a second of the universe -- to <unk> million times at the second .
And all that &apos;s just <unk> .
This is the car <unk> .
<unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk> .
This is what work . It &apos;s called <unk> -- is <unk> <unk> feet and <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> image of <unk> in the building .
The 10 <unk> <unk> year we <unk> the machine for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
And it was because of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> of the first <unk> of <unk> , <unk> in <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
In other words , when I <unk> that image 10 <unk> , <unk> that the <unk> machine , the <unk> that is a big <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if this <unk> to do more or this , when someone <unk> on Google and <unk> that the <unk> page was this .
And that means we had a <unk> impact beyond the <unk> .
I <unk> a week after , there was a problem with the machine , to these <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> of <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you <unk> and <unk> , &quot; is not true . I &apos;m too <unk> . &quot;
And instead they can do that because when they &apos;re very <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , at less <unk> degrees , to a temperature temperature <unk> to the space between the stars , these <unk> can <unk> that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> between the <unk> <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is again , if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and that are <unk> about 30 <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> all <unk> to their <unk> .
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> will be new <unk> .
<unk> , and we <unk> it to get the data or <unk> , and we can go to <unk> our <unk> to find what are the <unk> that <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> the value of science and <unk> <unk> <unk> . And it &apos;s easy to <unk> .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact , the fact , I think is this value of things like <unk> .
I want to <unk> with the words of a <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> by <unk> , he said , &quot; No <unk> <unk> to the ideas of the <unk> of the science of the <unk> of the science are not <unk> to <unk> the ideas of <unk> that are <unk> in the <unk> of our <unk> and <unk> that are not <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to <unk> when , <unk> , <unk> with <unk> .
<unk> as <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , actually , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that <unk> most of the world around us .
So , by <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects , and <unk> my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> , and if , we use a computer <unk> , instead of <unk> <unk> as a computer , instead of <unk> <unk> as a computer <unk> <unk> <unk> on a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was , the question that I <unk> to explore the answer , building the <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> computer is a <unk> computer .
In a few words , a <unk> computer is a <unk> computer .
You can <unk> them with the hand , you can <unk> them in their own , and they have a <unk> , and they have a <unk> <unk> .
But <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> objects , as <unk> , you can just <unk> <unk> .
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> the digital information .
And <unk> hand , they become more <unk> , <unk> , other people , and other <unk> , and <unk> hand , and other hand , as we can <unk> them , and we can <unk> new <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
I &apos;m going to <unk> with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show the video . And if you <unk> it in a direction , if we <unk> from the other side .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> of other .
If you <unk> them , you know what they &apos;re going to do it ,
If they <unk> , <unk> and they can <unk> a little bit .
If they <unk> , <unk> and they can <unk> a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We <unk> the interesting interesting <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> was the <unk> to use <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> data , to the <unk> a color like if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> <unk> to <unk> the color in the <unk> , where you <unk> .
and I can <unk> to <unk> <unk> color , where you <unk> .
If we can <unk> too , we can <unk> a little bit .
I &apos;m also <unk> <unk> , as <unk> , as <unk> , the mathematics and <unk> <unk> . And the <unk> of <unk> where people can try things , and <unk> the <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m --
This is a <unk> <unk> that I do with a program of <unk> .
And here we have a game of words that is <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , to every <unk> <unk> <unk> a letter to every <unk> , <unk> , <unk> every <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on a <unk> .
And then , after about 30 seconds <unk> , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , I did it in the way that I <unk> them and <unk> a video .
They are <unk> very much .
And one of the interesting things that <unk> is that you have to have to have people to have a lot of <unk> .
I just say , &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; , &quot; <unk> &quot; and they know exactly what do .
Here &apos;s other people who <unk> .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> more young , there &apos;s the right .
In fact , just wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to build a <unk> <unk> . He <unk> <unk> . He &apos;s <unk> .
It can <unk> new <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> their <unk> <unk> .
It can <unk> new <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> their <unk> <unk> .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now , <unk> a <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> .
<unk> work !
So , <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the <unk> can <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> !
-- <unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with the final <unk> , and it can <unk> him as <unk> .
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with the final <unk> , and it can <unk> him as <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have the last <unk> of show you is a <unk> , to show you , to <unk> and music .
It &apos;s a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> music .
<unk> here is <unk> by <unk> as the <unk> , and the <unk> .
<unk> of these has four <unk> , and you can choose .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
And I just <unk> <unk> a sound &quot; and a sound &quot; and a <unk> . &quot;
These are actually <unk> from live , as the <unk> and the <unk> .
I <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> <unk> .
And then there are the fact , as a time and <unk> , which <unk> to the entire <unk> .
<unk> as it works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> in two <unk> , &quot; <unk> , the <unk> in a series , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the other <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m going to take a <unk> line .
<unk> : Now , <unk> <unk> of <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> : And now I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , so I can control the effect from live .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the entire <unk> <unk> time from one side or another .
<unk> : <unk> : And now we <unk> the <unk> to <unk> the bottom to the bottom of the <unk> .
<unk> : I can <unk> the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> , <unk> more or more <unk> .
And now , I can <unk> the entire <unk> <unk> on the <unk> left the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
So , you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> and more <unk> to <unk> as our brain and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show one of the results of this <unk> , and some of the <unk> that we &apos;re trying to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to <unk> is that <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> with the media <unk> , which we want to <unk> in our world in our world that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk about all .
They &apos;re a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> but it &apos;s the most of this , of course .
It &apos;s also the love and the <unk> of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like that .
But , this is , something particular is <unk> in my life and in my career , and in my career , which <unk> me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I wrote this book , this <unk> book , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; which , <unk> from my <unk> <unk> , for some <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere , the people will <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I &apos;m going to be <unk> and I said , &quot; You don &apos;t fear than not <unk> to do better than better ?
You don &apos;t really have to write about the whole life without <unk> to make a book that can make a book that can <unk> ? &quot;
What can you <unk> ? &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> , you know .
But I remember , in the way , I remember that I remember the most 20 years ago , when I was <unk> to say , I was a <unk> .
I <unk> to <unk> the same <unk> .
And people say , &quot; Don &apos;t really <unk> to be <unk> ?
You don &apos;t fear that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> you ?
You don &apos;t fear of this <unk> for all of life without <unk> and <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
<unk> so , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
And , I <unk> fear of all those .
I always had fear .
And I also <unk> of many other things that people don &apos;t have <unk> .
As <unk> and other things .
But , as about the <unk> that I thought , and I thought I was <unk> <unk> , because ?
Is it <unk> ?
It &apos;s <unk> that anybody <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a work that you can <unk> to do .
But what &apos;s so that &apos;s so in the particular <unk> <unk> <unk> about <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> ?
How do my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I don &apos;t remember one time in the <unk> that <unk> was asked to be <unk> ?
He never did -- that <unk> <unk> <unk> John , as <unk> ?
Don &apos;t <unk> so , <unk> ?
<unk> , the engineers like not have been in the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> but <unk> every kind of <unk> <unk> .
And I don &apos;t want to look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often to their hand .
And even those who are not <unk> to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , first of <unk> , in the last <unk> said , &quot; Every my book , &quot; <unk> my <unk> <unk> in <unk> work .
But I don &apos;t <unk> when I <unk> <unk> because we &apos;ve heard these things so much in a way we &apos;ve got <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are in some <unk> way , and <unk> <unk> , to the end , and the art , and the end , and the <unk> , and <unk> , and the <unk> , and <unk> , and art , and the <unk> are <unk> and <unk>
And the question I want to <unk> to all here today is : you &apos;re <unk> with this idea ?
I &apos;m going to do this . because I also <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> to me not well for this <unk> .
I think it &apos;s <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s also <unk> and I don &apos;t want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better <unk> our big <unk> to live .
And I know , in my case -- in my <unk> -- it would be very <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in my career .
<unk> -- look at the , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;ve been about 40 years .
I still have about four <unk> of work in me .
And it &apos;s very <unk> that everything <unk> in the world , then it will be <unk> by the <unk> as the work that <unk> after the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , because we &apos;re all more or less friends here -- is <unk> that my biggest <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , that thought !
You know , this is the kind of thinking that <unk> a person to start <unk> <unk> to the nine of morning and I don &apos;t want to do that .
I <unk> to do this work . I love .
So , the question , how ?
And so , I think , a lot of <unk> , which the way to work to write is what we do a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to find a few <unk> of <unk> between me , which I &apos;m <unk> , and my natural <unk> on what he <unk> <unk> . And as I <unk> for all the year as we <unk> to do this <unk> to look at the time , to find the <unk> of the <unk> and find more ideas about to find out of ideas and <unk> .
<unk> to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research <unk> me to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And I <unk> because I <unk> back and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don &apos;t believe that <unk> creativity from men , OK ?
And so , I think that creativity was this <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men in a few <unk> and <unk> , for reasons , and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
The <unk> were <unk> of the same idea , but <unk> that species of the <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> , because <unk> <unk> don &apos;t really <unk> that a <unk> was particularly <unk> .
And I thought a <unk> was this <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , a little artist , a little bit like the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> out of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the work of the work and <unk> <unk> of the work .
<unk> <unk> here , that &apos;s the <unk> of which is the <unk> you from the <unk> of your work .
And everybody <unk> that was so that <unk> , right ?
So , the artists were <unk> by <unk> things , as the <unk> too , as the <unk> too , not ?
If your work was not <unk> <unk> <unk> all the <unk> , all <unk> that <unk> was <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it was not all <unk> , right ?
And all <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> the <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for very long time .
And then the <unk> <unk> and everything <unk> , and <unk> this big idea ; we put the human being in the universe , and the <unk> <unk> and <unk> no more <unk> to <unk> space and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> this big idea .
This was the <unk> of <unk> and people to think that <unk> creativity to think that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And for the first time in the history , you get to <unk> this or the artist as a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think that was a big <unk> .
I think I <unk> to someone , a simple person to believe being a <unk> as a <unk> as the source , the <unk> and the <unk> of all <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It &apos;s like to ask someone to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this <unk> to <unk> artists in <unk> <unk> <unk> artists in <unk> .
And , if this is true , and I think it &apos;s the question , and I think it &apos;s the question , and now ?
Can we do that <unk> ?
<unk> back to a <unk> understanding of the relationship between human and <unk> .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can &apos;t <unk> 500 years of <unk> thinking about <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
And probably there &apos;s people in the audience that <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , you do people <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> on their projects .
It &apos;s probably not going to show you all about this thing .
But the question I &apos;d like to <unk> is -- why don &apos;t ?
Why don &apos;t we <unk> in this way ?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that has ever heard about the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A process that has ever <unk> to do something -- so , we &apos;re going to do something -- so , you know , you don &apos;t <unk> <unk> .
And , in fact , can &apos;t look like <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which has now <unk> <unk> <unk> , but that &apos;s been a <unk> for the <unk> <unk> , and he said that in his <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , if you have a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
He said that was like a <unk> <unk> <unk> air .
And he <unk> <unk> to her <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , because he did the land under the land under its feet .
And I had one thing to do to do that point and was , &quot; <unk> as a <unk> . &quot;
And so I <unk> to home and he was <unk> by this <unk> , and it didn &apos;t have to take another piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> , as <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And we didn &apos;t <unk> to be very quickly , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> through the <unk> and she would <unk> through the <unk> , trying to <unk> the <unk> , trying to <unk> the <unk> , and as a <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this piece of piece of the moments that was almost <unk> , OK ?
So , was <unk> at home and was trying to <unk> and the <unk> <unk> through , and <unk> a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , and then he <unk> , and then he said , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; which was as if you <unk> with the other hand and <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> tail and the <unk> in the <unk> and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the page , and <unk> , but the <unk> , from the last <unk> .
So when <unk> <unk> -- is <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not all my process -- not the <unk> <unk> -- not a <unk> !
I &apos;m a <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> is ; <unk> the same <unk> every day and <unk> and work on <unk> .
But even I even <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , I <unk> against that thing .
And I &apos;m going to <unk> that many of you <unk> .
You know , even though the work and the ideas , I would have <unk> <unk> from a certain source , I could not <unk> <unk> .
And what is this ?
And how can we <unk> to it in it way to do not do the head , but rather , that <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
And as I &apos;m going to me , the best example I have the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I <unk> different years ago for a <unk> .
I &apos;m talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> <unk> <unk> , trying to control <unk> , <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , you <unk> , and a day , and a day , I was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , <unk> everything .
<unk> <unk> , and everything <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> in his head as <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , you know , <unk> and the , you know , is wonderful , and <unk> , you know , it &apos;s a great <unk> , but not as <unk> as <unk> .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , not a <unk> , not <unk> .
So , I &apos;m going to feel this kind of <unk> <unk> in him , &quot; I &apos;m going to get <unk> , and <unk> <unk> from this <unk> song .
I don &apos;t have enough to <unk> and I can &apos;t <unk> . &quot;
And instead of <unk> , they <unk> , they <unk> .
<unk> the entire process and he did something completely new .
I just <unk> the sky and he said , &quot; <unk> , you see ? &quot;
&quot; Do you know , how to write a song ?
If you really want to <unk> , you know , you know , I can <unk> the <unk> of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> other <unk> today .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And his process <unk> <unk> after this .
Not the work , the work was still <unk> as always as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> back to where he was , <unk> <unk> <unk> , which was <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
But I <unk> this <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing that but it was not <unk> .
So how I <unk> that story to change a little bit about the way I <unk> and I &apos;ve already <unk> a time .
This idea , I was <unk> when I was <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; and <unk> in a <unk> , and <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> where we &apos;re working on something and we &apos;re working on something and we &apos;re working on something and <unk> to think that &apos;s going to be a <unk> , which is going to be a <unk> .
Not just <unk> , just the <unk> book .
And I think about <unk> this project .
But then I <unk> <unk> that <unk> to the air and <unk> .
So I <unk> my face in the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
And I said , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , what we know if this book is not going to be <unk> my <unk> , no ?
Because as you see , I &apos;m <unk> all I have , I don &apos;t have more than this .
So if you want to <unk> and do your part of your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , you don &apos;t know .
I started to write my work .
And I &apos;d like to me to <unk> that I &apos;m going to do the <unk> to do my part of the end of Africa , the end is so -- <unk> <unk> in Africa in the <unk> Africa of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the moon , and <unk> that <unk> to <unk> and <unk> to <unk> hours .
And they were always <unk> , because <unk> were <unk> and <unk> .
But every , I <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists in fact ,
And I know , I know what I &apos;m going to talk about , because I know you have all of the way .
It was like if time <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> through a species of <unk> and was not doing anything different from the <unk> , but all <unk> <unk> .
And in fact not just as a human <unk> .
But you <unk> from <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
And when this <unk> , the days , people <unk> what was , the <unk> with her name .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , God , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> <unk> with their <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot;
In <unk> , when a artist has done something impossible and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- one <unk> -- one <unk> <unk> -- one of God .
And it &apos;s because we need .
But , the problem is the day , for the <unk> , when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> God no <unk> .
It &apos;s just a <unk> with <unk> , and maybe it never <unk> to <unk> that <unk> .
And maybe no one <unk> the name of God , and what does to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe not to be so <unk> if we &apos;re not going to believe that if we &apos;re not going to believe , <unk> <unk> than your <unk> .
But I just <unk> you to <unk> this data in <unk> from a <unk> of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk> .
And , you know , if we think about this way .
And so I started <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> as I <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
And what I have to go to <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , not <unk> .
They don &apos;t just <unk> your work .
They &apos;re <unk> to <unk> your part , any of it can be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , you <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , then , &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
<unk> , you do the same <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to do it .
I think , and I think <unk> <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; You know , &quot; You know , only to have the human love and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know , I &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
Now we &apos;re going to <unk> a new <unk> , we started to <unk> biology and now to <unk> that <unk> the digital <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve always been doing the big questions .
&quot; <unk> is something that can <unk> <unk> to understand <unk> . I think they have to understand <unk> <unk> .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to <unk> terms .
We &apos;re going to be <unk> 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome is we <unk> from the world of the <unk> biology in the <unk> of the computer .
Now we <unk> : We can <unk> the life , or to create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the most small <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to <unk> the genome to <unk> the genome to <unk> a more small .
We &apos;re able to <unk> a <unk> of genes about 500 genes that are here .
But when we give a look at the map , it &apos;s simple <unk> than our own .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at the time , it &apos;s very <unk> that can <unk> a <unk> cell .
So , I <unk> that the only <unk> <unk> <unk> this <unk> <unk> in the way to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of &quot; We can <unk> a <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
Can the <unk> of <unk> that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And , in <unk> , we can <unk> <unk> a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And the speed we are able to <unk> the life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the code , instead of <unk> , instead , but it &apos;s <unk> .
And our most <unk> <unk> <unk> on a <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve been <unk> more than 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> many <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before <unk> .
But we found that <unk> of DNA is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of machines in the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> is more <unk> , <unk> is more <unk> , <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
And so we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , to the <unk> information from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a little <unk> that bacteria .
We <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> and we <unk> the bacteria , the bacteria have <unk> to read this <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> particles are <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> back and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ve talked about the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that they have been <unk> this model .
They have more than you .
And I think this is a very <unk> situation where the software can actually build the same <unk> in a <unk> system .
But I <unk> to do the biggest things in the biggest <unk> .
We <unk> to build the entire <unk> of <unk> .
They &apos;re more <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we thought about <unk> in the <unk> of the size of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is <unk> , and if we <unk> with information <unk> in a computer , these have to be very <unk> .
When I <unk> this genome for the first time in the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> <unk> for every 10 <unk> .
We &apos;ve discovered , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If we were used that <unk> <unk> never <unk> that original <unk> never <unk> .
A part of the process is design <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of the <unk> to build more small <unk> that <unk> together .
<unk> elements here .
You probably have to read that <unk> <unk> .
So , we have a <unk> code on four <unk> : <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , and there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> for every <unk> .
So we can use the code for write words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did at the beginning was <unk> .
Some of them have been <unk> from the fact that was not <unk> .
We &apos;ve <unk> these <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> and <unk> them <unk> .
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . And we started to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . And we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And at all we <unk> these <unk> in <unk> so <unk> that we &apos;re <unk> to create a very <unk> <unk> as you see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to <unk> the process .
So , this seems the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When I <unk> these <unk> very <unk> , more than 100 <unk> <unk> , not <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> biology .
So we <unk> other <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to <unk> another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
That &apos;s a example .
This <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> <unk> .
In 12 hours , it &apos;s <unk> as before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can <unk> completely <unk> .
We &apos;re going to live in <unk> .
They &apos;re absolutely sure that life in space , and you get to find new <unk> <unk> of water .
And in the real , the NASA has shown this is .
This is a picture of the <unk> we &apos;ve built these <unk> , just using these <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This image not been <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a big <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a <unk> period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we did have a little bit about time ago .
They &apos;re more <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s the biggest <unk> of a <unk> structure ever <unk> from the man .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> with a <unk> 10 , we <unk> pages , we <unk> pages pages to <unk> this <unk> <unk> .
Now , how do we do that work ?
<unk> , <unk> through a virus .
It &apos;s a little more <unk> when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s even though it &apos;s also about cells as our own : can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is <unk> <unk> and <unk> another , which is <unk> process .
In <unk> <unk> the <unk> is instead of <unk> in the cell , but we <unk> <unk> that we can do a <unk> <unk> <unk> from a <unk> cell phone .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> <unk> .
The two are different than men from <unk> .
We &apos;ve <unk> some <unk> in the <unk> way to <unk> this <unk> .
And he <unk> with the <unk> <unk> in the way to <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And <unk> <unk> that we didn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to <unk> more in there .
This is one of the most <unk> of evolution .
We &apos;ve discovered that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> in a <unk> , <unk> in a <unk> new <unk> <unk> to that species .
So who think about evolution as a only <unk> at the time that <unk> doesn &apos;t really understand the biology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> the DNA .
The <unk> that was in the cell , we didn &apos;t <unk> one .
The <unk> <unk> we <unk> the <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , and he <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material , and <unk> <unk> .
It has become blue because of genes that we <unk> .
And in a <unk> <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species are go , and it &apos;s <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the new <unk> .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when <unk> the code <unk> <unk> exactly what we <unk> .
Now , this could look like <unk> <unk> , but we can change the DNA software we can change things in a very <unk> .
Now , I &apos;ve already <unk> that here is not about <unk> -- but it &apos;s going to be able to <unk> from three million years and I &apos;ve already been to create a new version of <unk> <unk> <unk> in this <unk> <unk> <unk> in this process of <unk> <unk> in this process .
Why do we do this ?
I think it &apos;s enough to <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion people to <unk> billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give a example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in the <unk> ; there &apos;s four will be four .
We &apos;re going to find food now to find food , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> for six billion people .
We &apos;re still going to do that for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> .
That means percent of <unk> at the day .
When we &apos;re looking at <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process for <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
In the most <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
At the day today , thank you <unk> <unk> in the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like thinking that are <unk> <unk> to the <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry only one <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out of <unk> .
Our <unk> here are data from the reality of the reality , and our imagination .
We have <unk> <unk> , thank you to these <unk> <unk> , can create what we do <unk> <unk> .
We can make a big robot that can produce a <unk> robot that can produce a day .
Think of these 20 million genes or <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because we can change , in a little <unk> , and create more <unk> biology in the last 20 years .
And it &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> .
We can <unk> for <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the software <unk> that we &apos;re working on to be able to <unk> and design species to <unk> and design species to make it .
Well , we don &apos;t know how to be .
We know exactly how their <unk> code .
Now we &apos;re <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> generation .
You saw that you see <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment from the <unk> was a <unk> .
We &apos;ve <unk> second generation and the third generation that we <unk> enough to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> to the <unk> of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> to make cells that to make this <unk> to make this <unk> of <unk> , and we can make the first <unk> of <unk> in 18 months .
The light <unk> <unk> with the CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> in the world , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> we <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> in the ocean , about <unk> feet of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> by the <unk> of the hydrogen <unk> as energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can <unk> the CO2 , which can be <unk> by <unk> <unk> , <unk> that CO2 <unk> in <unk> , to <unk> this process .
So , we think about a short that we could be able to <unk> what the question is , &quot; which is the <unk> of <unk> <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> . If you can &apos;t do that from TED , where can you ?
<unk> a <unk> source of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working on the same <unk> to create <unk> .
You saw this year with the flu , we &apos;re always <unk> back to a year and with a dollar <unk> .
I think that what you can change <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And so that the future could start to look at the future , the tree of evolution , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and finally <unk> .
We &apos;re so much about the <unk> people .
Our <unk> is to do in the way to live long enough to try to try to try to <unk> . Thank you very much .
First of all I &apos;m going to show you , the most <unk> possible , in the new technology that we <unk> to <unk> in the <unk> to <unk> a <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> environment that you can <unk> is <unk> at the local level that we <unk> with a huge amount of data .
Here we &apos;re seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> images as we want .
And not matter how big is the <unk> of information that we see , how big these <unk> <unk> or the images .
Most <unk> pictures , but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in <unk> <unk> , and <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that <unk> <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> . It &apos;s also a very <unk> architecture . It &apos;s also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a book , in the entire <unk> , not images .
This is the <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
So , the <unk> that &apos;s just about the <unk> and not images , we can do something like this , to make a real <unk> of the <unk> , not a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , not a <unk> <unk> .
It could be a little <unk> to read a little <unk> book .
I don &apos;t <unk> .
This is a <unk> example . It &apos;s about a <unk> number of the <unk> .
Every image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And I &apos;m really going to show you the <unk> experience to read the real <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is to nature a <unk> <unk> .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the <unk> .
We &apos;ve created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much more than the <unk> that <unk> <unk> in a <unk> and <unk> you have <unk> <unk> .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
And I think that this <unk> <unk> to <unk> and other <unk> as <unk> , not <unk> to be <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this <unk> not to <unk> time , if we don &apos;t want to say that we have <unk> to <unk> in this <unk> .
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> over the United States .
So now I &apos;m going to do something else .
This is now actually from the web on the web ; you can see it .
It &apos;s a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
A <unk> is <unk> and the other is a very interesting research in the very interesting <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> of Washington , with the help of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s about the web , <unk> <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from another image to the other , and we can <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here actually has actually a meaning .
So , the <unk> of the computer <unk> , <unk> these pictures together , in the way that <unk> all <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and these things are <unk> to <unk> and these are all <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some <unk> <unk> .
I want to go to one of the <unk> data and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> and this <unk> <unk> that we did work for the first time to show you what I &apos;m going to show you what the key technology is that really the key technology of this technology , the <unk> technology . And it &apos;s a <unk> in the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> pictures of <unk> and <unk> <unk> . And so on <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> this model of model .
So , they &apos;re all <unk> pictures and they &apos;re all <unk> to <unk> level in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to <unk> this way .
You know , I would never thought to work to work to <unk> .
It &apos;s very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think I think that &apos;s about a lot of different kinds of <unk> : from those <unk> <unk> , a number of <unk> , <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , we <unk> to try and <unk> them .
Many are <unk> by <unk> , and so much .
<unk> here is a series of pictures -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from the view of this environment .
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now <unk> data from <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> all those together .
All of those pictures become together , the most <unk> of the parts .
You have a <unk> model that <unk> .
And think about this as the <unk> of <unk> work on Earth <unk> on the Earth .
It &apos;s something that <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , and the people <unk> , and the <unk> that <unk> to <unk> with the use .
Their <unk> are <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
If someone &apos;s the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of all of those <unk> , and I can use as a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all of that are very <unk> models of the land , <unk> not just by <unk> <unk> and <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
CA : I realized that well ? What do your software software is that your software <unk> to do is that in the next few years , all the <unk> from anybody in the entire world . How do we have to <unk> ?
<unk> : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is doing is doing .
It &apos;s <unk> to <unk> , if you want , in the images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the <unk> of the <unk> .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> of information that many of these pictures .
As a research of images on the web , you <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> on the web <unk> and the <unk> on the web of the <unk> .
Now , what happens if that picture <unk> to all your <unk> ?
So the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> effect .
CA : <unk> , it &apos;s really incredible .
<unk> : <unk> you very much .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the research is the <unk> to live in the <unk> , who don &apos;t <unk> the <unk> in the wind , the <unk> in the wind , the <unk> in the wind , the <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
And I think that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , or in <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , to remember the <unk> of <unk> , and the idea that the idea in there are not just a sense of the world , but the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , but not just a reality .
<unk> a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that our <unk> <unk> , well , many <unk> ago , many <unk> ago .
And , of course , all <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> . <unk> . <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We have to <unk> the death of death , so we don &apos;t <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art .
What <unk> is the <unk> <unk> of the song , the <unk> of the <unk> of every culture .
They don &apos;t care that are the <unk> of <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of <unk> .
He was my <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> a month ago , or a month ago , <unk> in <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
All of these <unk> <unk> us that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of thinking , other ways of other ways of <unk> in the world .
And , if you <unk> a second , it &apos;s a moment that can give you hope .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> of the world create a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and <unk> that <unk> the planet as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> .
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> , all the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
<unk> is the <unk> <unk> of humanity .
It &apos;s the <unk> of what we &apos;re and what we can be in the species .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all the species is about <unk> <unk> -- that &apos;s about <unk> because it &apos;s <unk> , or -- in the <unk> <unk> -- in the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> -- and you don &apos;t have to <unk> more <unk> -- and you don &apos;t even <unk> <unk> -- that <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of all that is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you &apos;re <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just <unk> by a <unk> or a series of <unk> rules .
A language is the <unk> of human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle with which <unk> of every culture is in the world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a <unk> , a <unk> thought , a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we &apos;re <unk> in <unk> , at least the half the <unk> of the children .
They &apos;re not <unk> to the children , the <unk> , the less than you don &apos;t know something , which are already death .
What &apos;s more <unk> of the <unk> of being <unk> by the <unk> , the last to talk about a language , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> was the <unk> of someone in some part of the world every two weeks : every two weeks , every two weeks a <unk> <unk> and <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I know somebody of you <unk> , &quot; How do you know ?
The world would not be a better place if we <unk> all the same language ? &quot; <unk> , then we all <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> a <unk> thing that means that we can &apos;t talk about their language .
Now , I &apos;d like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
And a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we &apos;re <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say , &quot; different ways of <unk> . &quot; I mean , &quot; I really want different ways of <unk> .
<unk> for example this <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> that is not able to <unk> the blue color from the green because the <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , a different <unk> .
And all the <unk> in the past <unk> , but the <unk> is that in these <unk> <unk> where you &apos;re talking about , you &apos;re talking about <unk> <unk> no one language .
They <unk> to <unk> and then <unk> to talk about .
I <unk> one of the most interesting <unk> with what I &apos;ve been , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that has the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
They did <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> never saw anything <unk> .
They have <unk> the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to research <unk> , and <unk> , not <unk> nothing , they have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . And they <unk> the five <unk> <unk> .
But <unk> not only <unk> the <unk> .
They <unk> between them .
<unk> percent of <unk> was <unk> by their own .
We &apos;re <unk> eight <unk> and we found two cases of death and when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was so that it &apos;s dead <unk> , and then they <unk> the same <unk> . And then they <unk> the same way .
<unk> were able to <unk> the animal <unk> <unk> by 40 <unk> and <unk> the species .
<unk> years , I was <unk> a very interesting <unk> to <unk> a really interesting <unk> when my <unk> <unk> <unk> , if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And to give a sense to the <unk> , I would have to understand the culture and that <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s pretty much about a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> very interesting .
If you <unk> the big <unk> of the world , what do I <unk> ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
A continent is always <unk> out , thinking that Africa is not <unk> <unk> . And instead of <unk> , instead of <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes interesting <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> and death .
So , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> in the way that to a little bit about the <unk> .
So , the <unk> <unk> to talk about God , you go to the God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re <unk> , is the spirit that you can tell you about <unk> ?
So , you know , these incredible <unk> : <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> with which I &apos;ve been <unk> the most <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . And once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> never was <unk> by <unk> .
<unk> today are <unk> by a <unk> , but their <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> young people are <unk> by the families to three or four , and live in a world <unk> and <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> to 18 years .
Two <unk> of nine months of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
So , to this time , they &apos;re <unk> to their values , <unk> that <unk> their <unk> and just <unk> their <unk> <unk> -- or just <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or better than the <unk> <unk> .
So , the <unk> of this <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> <unk> out and for the first time , they see a <unk> . And in that <unk> <unk> <unk> . And in that moment of <unk> <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the sun <unk> of <unk> , all the <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> . And in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ? <unk> as I said .
It &apos;s <unk> . Now , it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
They call the most <unk> and they say that we have , <unk> <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re the <unk> of the world .
This is very important .
When we think about <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the old <unk> <unk> and the old <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> or maybe we say that these <unk> are more <unk> than we do .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> from <unk> .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , but thank you very much <unk> of the Earth , and <unk> , they created a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , but a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : the concept that the concept can actually be <unk> because of the human <unk> .
What does it mean ?
And I mean that a <unk> of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> is a different <unk> and will have a different <unk> of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What is the <unk> of one <unk> or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world .
I <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
And that <unk> me a human being <unk> from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If we <unk> that these <unk> can create different <unk> , we start to understand some of their <unk> <unk> .
I <unk> this picture to <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes fascinating is the <unk> is not the potential <unk> of <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> by two elements .
<unk> , this <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> <unk> . And <unk> <unk> a little bit of the <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you &apos;ll see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> that they do <unk> the <unk> that they do with a different <unk> of species , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> <unk> is a little bit like to be <unk> by a <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a <unk> of electricity . It &apos;s not a <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> often with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> was <unk> , with his <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
And the <unk> , you can &apos;t tell these <unk> as <unk> because if you &apos;re not going to tell anybody about being <unk> . <unk> <unk> , but they can &apos;t be <unk> <unk> because they &apos;re <unk> by a <unk> that is in the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s possible to <unk> just if we <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
Now , the <unk> that are in this <unk> <unk> are in this <unk> <unk> , the same kind of <unk> , the <unk> question : <unk> <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> , how do these <unk> to <unk> <unk> , but if they make these <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . What if you &apos;re going to make a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We use the big <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you <unk> to <unk> , we <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
What does it mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If you <unk> their <unk> as <unk> their <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the <unk> . &quot;
The solution is : <unk> <unk> <unk> in a <unk> , <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
With this doesn &apos;t <unk> us to <unk> , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> .
Now , <unk> the problem is that even those of us that have to heart <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , but in some way to the <unk> of our world to <unk> <unk> <unk> in our world , and beyond .
In fact , the <unk> century , <unk> , not <unk> <unk> for <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> , but as the <unk> <unk> <unk> , but as the <unk> was in which we &apos;re <unk> and we <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the problem .
All the <unk> through the <unk> were <unk> in a new <unk> for life .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> don &apos;t have <unk> <unk> to be <unk> when they put them in the <unk> and so as the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that <unk> <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s the power of <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you look at the world , you know , they &apos;re not <unk> to <unk> .
They &apos;re creatures <unk> and <unk> out of the <unk> of the forces that are beyond their ability to <unk> .
And I <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
<unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that has <unk> in the forest to the <unk> and <unk> <unk> on the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> to <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the discovery of <unk> .
If we <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the <unk> <unk> of politics .
As <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> physics of a <unk> , is <unk> to <unk> , but the <unk> of a <unk> , the <unk> of a <unk> , not only <unk> in some <unk> <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in some <unk> <unk> , because of the <unk> of development .
And you can &apos;t understand the <unk> of <unk> until the beginning .
I <unk> the <unk> miles from <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but just <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> , but only <unk> to talk about .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
The father &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that means that was <unk> to the Chinese days of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk> .
It was <unk> in <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> at the age of two <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , because he could not have to live without him .
<unk> , which has done the same , was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
A day <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and , and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to work for seven years .
The pain of <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> of <unk> is <unk> by <unk> .
And in the end , all <unk> to a choice .
<unk> to live in the world <unk> or we want to <unk> the world of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the <unk> of the diversity of the <unk> or we want to <unk> the world ?
The big <unk> <unk> , before he was <unk> <unk> , before he was <unk> the <unk> of the world , in our <unk> to this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world , not only <unk> the entire <unk> of the human imagination , but a day <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of thinking , but one day there were other <unk> .
And it &apos;s <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we &apos;re talking about <unk> <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> <unk> <unk> , we have the answers to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to get to the challenges that we &apos;re going to come to the <unk> .
When these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked to be asked human , <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> different <unk> .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all <unk> the chance of being what we &apos;re : a kind of <unk> , which has to make it in the way that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , when I went to <unk> with <unk> <unk> , and this man , <unk> me , <unk> <unk> me , <unk> <unk> me , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The government <unk> is not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
The family , <unk> for his life , and <unk> <unk> all the <unk> , and all his <unk> .
They want to know that the <unk> doesn &apos;t <unk> the cold , <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the <unk> were <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn &apos;t <unk> from night or <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , you have <unk> the <unk> in the skin <unk> and <unk> in their hand . When I did <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to talk about <unk> ? <unk> ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> of California and <unk> together .
It &apos;s their new <unk> . It &apos;s called <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . <unk> all the <unk> resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , to end , I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> at least at least at least at the <unk> of the planet , <unk> that they <unk> are not <unk> .
For someone is home .
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that we <unk> to <unk> <unk> . And for us all , the dreams of these kids , as the dreams of our children , become part of the <unk> of the hope .
So , we have <unk> <unk> <unk> we are <unk> that <unk> <unk> never <unk> to be <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> --
<unk> is not <unk> , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best <unk> to tell stories about the world . Every month our website are <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in the <unk> to bring our audience in places , and we have <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> as they saw and <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> <unk> of <unk> : the <unk> of <unk> : the <unk> of <unk> : the <unk> of <unk> : the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the world and find a <unk> .
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book I hope to have heard of <unk> and <unk> to <unk> some <unk> in the case , in the case , not <unk> .
I want to start with what I call the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
<unk> <unk> ?
The <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : &quot; If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens , &quot; The way to do it is <unk> the freedom . &quot;
The reason is , from one side , in fact , the freedom is in the same <unk> , is <unk> , <unk> to human beings .
And so , the fact that if we &apos;re <unk> , all of us can do for all the way to do everything that we <unk> our <unk> <unk> , no no <unk> in our <unk> .
The way to <unk> the freedom is <unk> the choice .
The most <unk> people , they &apos;re more <unk> , and more <unk> , and the most <unk> is their freedom .
This , <unk> , is so <unk> <unk> in the society that no one <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it &apos;s also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what the progress is possible .
This is my <unk> . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I <unk> a simple <unk> on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> 12 <unk> <unk> and 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> that nobody of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> that nobody of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
That &apos;s the <unk> .
And then you go to the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> of <unk> , there &apos;s a big number of <unk> .
We can make this <unk> <unk> <unk> using the <unk> that there are in a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice .
<unk> <unk> : The world of <unk> .
Once I was a child , when I was a child , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> .
They <unk> the phone , not <unk> .
A <unk> of what , in the other , was that the phone never <unk> .
These days , they went .
We have a <unk> <unk> <unk> , especially between the cell phones .
That &apos;s the <unk> of the future .
My <unk> is in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you don &apos;t have seen the <unk> in the <unk> , you &apos;re very well in the <unk> , you &apos;re very <unk> .
And what the end is that people <unk> in the <unk> and it does this question . And you know , is the answer ? &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do things .
So , in other <unk> life that are much more important than <unk> , you <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : You don &apos;t have the <unk> in the United States and the <unk> you have to do .
Instead , I <unk> from the <unk> , and the <unk> says , &quot; OK , we could do , or <unk> , or <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> these <unk> and these <unk> <unk> . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You know , the <unk> , what do you do ? &quot;
And the <unk> says , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> these <unk> , and <unk> these <unk> . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; <unk> if she was me , what do ? &quot;
And the <unk> , &quot; But I don &apos;t have her . &quot;
The result we call &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> that <unk> <unk> the <unk> , which is <unk> .
But actually , it &apos;s not that one <unk> the weight and the <unk> of the decisions of someone who knows something that knows , <unk> to <unk> other than not -- and almost <unk> of course , and it doesn &apos;t know -- and so in the <unk> of the decisions .
There &apos;s a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> people like me and you , and you , that if you think about it is not any sense , because we can &apos;t <unk> .
But if we can &apos;t <unk> , why do we <unk> them ?
The answer is that we call the <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And we &apos;re going to <unk> that is our <unk> <unk> is a choice of choice , as you see in this <unk> <unk> . We don &apos;t want to <unk> the <unk> . They don &apos;t want to <unk> the <unk> . We don &apos;t have a <unk> <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
The <unk> means that every <unk> , to <unk> , you have to be .
<unk> to the family and the <unk> , a time the common perspective , almost <unk> to anybody , and it &apos;s <unk> the most possible <unk> , and you can <unk> kids to be able to do it .
The only choice was with who , not when , and not even that what to do after .
<unk> , all is really to play .
I <unk> students very smart , and they <unk> their 20 percent in less than work in a time .
And because they &apos;re not <unk> , because they &apos;re not <unk> .
But why are <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> or not ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> ? I have to think before kids or the career ? &quot;
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
And they &apos;re looking at these questions , even if this <unk> doesn &apos;t <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and not get a <unk> <unk> to my <unk> .
And they really have to do that . They have important questions .
Now , the work : we &apos;re <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because technology <unk> us to work every day , every day , every day of <unk> , <unk> that <unk> from <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> , and I don &apos;t tell anybody what the <unk> works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What does it mean , this incredible choice of choice we have about work ? It &apos;s what we have to <unk> , and if we have to work or not .
We can go to our son to <unk> , with the <unk> in a <unk> , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
And even though I &apos;m all <unk> , every minute we see our <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re also <unk> , &quot; I have to answer this called &quot; ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this letter ? I have to <unk> this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is not , &quot; not , &quot; all this is the experience of <unk> your son .
So , by the way we look at things , and big materials , and <unk> , objects and <unk> life , the life is a <unk> question .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there were some of the chance , but it was not a <unk> .
The world today is now about this : The <unk> is , &quot; What is , or <unk> ? &quot;
The answer is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> them all , so I &apos;m going to talk about the <unk> .
<unk> this choice <unk> this choice : two <unk> people .
The first , <unk> , is that it <unk> instead of <unk> .
With many <unk> in which to <unk> , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I &apos;ll give you a <unk> <unk> : a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> .
A <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> society , with about a million <unk> <unk> in different <unk> .
What she has discovered is that for every 10 10 solutions that are <unk> in the most of <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of two percent .
With 50 percent <unk> , there &apos;s 10 percent less than <unk> than when they &apos;re <unk> to <unk> . Because they &apos;re just <unk> five percent . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> between which , is <unk> difficult to decide , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And in <unk> , and again , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , you know , it &apos;s never .
And I mean , just <unk> that these <unk> <unk> food to <unk> food because they will not have enough money , but it wants to say that the decision is so <unk> <unk> <unk> of work .
They &apos;re not <unk> , <unk> until <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> year , which would be <unk> to <unk> .
So , the <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
And I think that <unk> the world so .
&quot; And to the <unk> , to the <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
<unk> to take the right decision , if it &apos;s the right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the <unk> , and <unk> the wrong <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can <unk> the <unk> and do a choice , at the end is less <unk> by the <unk> of how to <unk> in which .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of <unk> in which is <unk> , if you <unk> a <unk> and it &apos;s not a perfect choice that could do a different choice that is that happens . And that happens to be better . And that happens is that happens to <unk> us to <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> of choice , and the <unk> <unk> of choice . And the <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> .
even when it was a <unk> decision .
The more choices is , the most <unk> <unk> of anything that is <unk> of <unk> choice .
And also , there &apos;s what the <unk> call <unk> <unk> .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well as the value that we do things to <unk> things from what we <unk> .
And you know , when there are many possible , is very easy to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and being less than <unk> than <unk> .
Here &apos;s a example . I <unk> with all those who are not in New York .
But it &apos;s what it is probably <unk> .
There &apos;s this <unk> to <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It &apos;s all about them .
Not <unk> . But what he thinks he thinks he &apos;s , &quot; Well , <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; <unk> my <unk> to <unk> are . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And <unk> two weeks <unk> from the idea that &apos;s <unk> -- every day -- the <unk> of <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for that we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And more , the <unk> we have <unk> , the most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> .
Here &apos;s another example .
This <unk> <unk> us a lot of things .
We &apos;re going to live the moment , and maybe maybe the <unk> to be <unk> .
But the most important point is that any of you <unk> , you &apos;re going to do not do the other .
The things that don &apos;t have many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried to my skin <unk> a new <unk> .
<unk> almost always <unk> .
Once <unk> the <unk> were just a kind of , <unk> them and <unk> <unk> <unk> , they were <unk> , just after <unk> <unk> a lot of times , <unk> , to go to the well .
So , I <unk> to <unk> a couple of when the <unk> were , and I said , &quot; I &apos;m going to have a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> <unk> said , &quot; <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
<unk> them , or <unk> with <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> -- &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
I was <unk> , and after a little bit , I was <unk> , &quot; I want to say , &quot; I want to be the one . &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; and then I was <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then <unk> from the best <unk> , with the best <unk> .
It was the <unk> .
But I <unk> worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to <unk> .
The reason I was going to be with all that choice of my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn &apos;t <unk> . I didn &apos;t know anything about <unk> when we <unk> 100 different , when we <unk> 100 different <unk> , at least a kind of <unk> .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
And after I <unk> to <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in life of people not do that <unk> the <unk> that these <unk> <unk> that these <unk> <unk> .
And this <unk> less <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of <unk> that <unk> .
Because if you <unk> , not <unk> what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth <unk> to this .
&quot; <unk> was better when it was the worse than the reason that was better when it was going to be <unk> as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world we live -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
You &apos;ve never <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , are <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; Yeah , you want to do . &quot;
I mean -- little <unk> moment -- which are really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn &apos;t have better , I don &apos;t have <unk> .
But I don &apos;t always have a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> when there &apos;s only that kind of <unk> <unk> when there &apos;s not only that kind of <unk> is that when you &apos;re not <unk> , and you say , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is <unk> ? &quot; What is <unk> .
The world is the <unk> . What can I do it ?
When there are hundreds of <unk> , and we <unk> a <unk> , and you <unk> a <unk> , and you &apos;ll <unk> who are <unk> you .
We could <unk> better .
With hundreds of <unk> <unk> , there are not <unk> for <unk> .
So when people <unk> decisions , even though the result is <unk> , they <unk> and <unk> <unk> to their own .
In the last years the <unk> is <unk> in the world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but it &apos;s important -- this <unk> of <unk> is so that people have <unk> <unk> because the <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation that <unk> is their <unk> .
So the final result is that in general is that we &apos;re better , but we <unk> .
I &apos;m going to tell you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and is completely <unk> . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no <unk> that a little bit better choice is better than <unk> at all , but by this doesn &apos;t <unk> as much better than a little bit better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a <unk> value , <unk> . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m going to <unk> that we <unk> from a piece of a piece of the <unk> that we <unk> our lives .
Now , from the point of view -- I &apos;ve been <unk> -- from the point of view , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What <unk> this choice in the <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you &apos;re <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that have <unk> choice .
The problem is that we have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I &apos;m talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what it does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> of <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> of money .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , it &apos;s not just <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
They do that .
If a little bit of what in our society <unk> choice was <unk> in those where people have too much <unk> , not just <unk> their lives , but also would be the <unk> to also our lives .
This is what the <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s not just the poor -- not only the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> .
So , I &apos;ll become everything you want to be , &quot;
<unk> , people , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; But what <unk> is that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s <unk> that you can &apos;t make anything in a <unk> of <unk> . &quot;
&quot; <unk> imagination , a <unk> vision of the world --
and I <unk> my <unk> so , I <unk> it , I <unk> it .
But then , <unk> , instead , I &apos;m <unk> , I &apos;m <unk> that fish knows .
Because the reality is that if you <unk> in <unk> <unk> , in the way that , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s possible . It <unk> the <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> in the way that we can <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> .
They all need a <unk> .
This is almost too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and it &apos;s <unk> to us .
But the <unk> of <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , <unk> , to <unk> <unk> .
Thank you very much .
