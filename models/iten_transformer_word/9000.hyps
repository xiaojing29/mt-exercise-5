<unk> year I showed these <unk> for <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years had the <unk> of the United States of the United States , <unk> , is <unk> of 40 percent .
I &apos;m going to <unk> this <unk> of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is , in a sense , the heart <unk> of climate system .
They <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
As you see , you &apos;re going to go to the blue <unk> .
That &apos;s the ice in <unk> , which <unk> <unk> .
You can see that the ice <unk> ice , of five or more , it &apos;s like blood , that &apos;s <unk> from the body .
<unk> years is <unk> by this , so that .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> around the ocean <unk> where there are huge amount of <unk> that , <unk> are <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> are <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> from global <unk> , that amount of <unk> , that <unk> could not <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is already <unk> by water .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! Al <unk> : She &apos;s OK . The question is if we <unk> it .
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> from the north .
This is a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> had never <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> river , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> , here is where the sea <unk> .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the other side of the planet : <unk> , the largest ice <unk> of the planet .
<unk> month scientists have <unk> that the ice <unk> is in <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> , which <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> feet of <unk> , like in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the <unk> third big <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , <unk> , a few years ago ,
<unk> percent of the world &apos;s population <unk> <unk> from that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : this <unk> is the source of water <unk> of this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when I <unk> , the same thing happens to water .
In California , <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> of 40 percent .
<unk> <unk> are in crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they &apos;re <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the world <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a normal outside and without <unk> .
<unk> times over the last 30 years , than the <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> .
If you look at the <unk> context , if you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we &apos;ve <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 <unk> -- 25 million <unk> in the oceans .
You see the area of the <unk> <unk> , from <unk> , to <unk> , and on both parts of the <unk> <unk> , where there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> oxygen in the ocean .
The <unk> cause global <unk> , together to the <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the <unk> use <unk> .
<unk> is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions , with China .
And you &apos;re going to build a lot of other <unk> .
But we &apos;re going to be a <unk> of the direction .
These are the projects in the last few years and some of <unk> <unk> .
So , there &apos;s a <unk> politics in our country .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to have something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it on the <unk> .
This is the second largest flow flow in America .
It &apos;s <unk> around <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> â™« <unk> the <unk> is a kind of <unk> and happy .
It &apos;s <unk> here in America , and <unk> <unk> our economy .
<unk> is <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> here , <unk> , <unk> ,
The largest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- not know what they &apos;re talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> <unk> has two <unk> .
This is one of them , one part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> , we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business .
So , in our <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public <unk> and <unk> the truth to <unk> .
It actually doesn &apos;t <unk> .
We think it &apos;s <unk> -- it &apos;s also a good <unk> .
So we don &apos;t <unk> <unk> climate change .
We can do .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you &apos;ve heard about it very much .
So I &apos;m going to take a <unk> structure for <unk> to <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> are a little <unk> , but this is the sound of <unk> technology .
<unk> is <unk> between the <unk> of global <unk> , but <unk> technology of <unk> , but <unk> technology that you see it changes .
<unk> a look at this , this is the <unk> technology of <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic <unk> to the economic security and to the national security .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> America is in crisis ; the economy , <unk> , <unk> .
The <unk> that <unk> all : our <unk> from <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and oil <unk> .
Now , there &apos;s a new <unk> , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan to <unk> America at work , <unk> more <unk> , and help us <unk> the global <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we started to solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
<unk> : This is the last .
<unk> : <unk> : It &apos;s about <unk> energy to America .
One of the <unk> ways of <unk> , <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , a new <unk> network .
<unk> <unk> two : <unk> for <unk> <unk> for jobs .
<unk> : <unk> America . It &apos;s time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A old <unk> <unk> says , &quot; If you want to go out of alone .
If you want to go away , go together . &quot;
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED I made a <unk> on the <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to try to <unk> on how machine works .
So , I &apos;m going to go . And for the other time , there were no , the <unk> <unk> is the largest experiment .
<unk> is <unk> the conditions that were <unk> <unk> <unk> by the beginning of the universe -- to <unk> million times to <unk> million times per second .
All that &apos;s just <unk> .
This is the <unk> machine .
<unk> these <unk> <unk> into the <unk> .
This is what work . It &apos;s called <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> feet , and it &apos;s <unk> feet .
This is a <unk> picture of <unk> in building so you can see the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> last year , we <unk> the machine for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was because of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> of particles that had done all the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles inside the <unk> .
In other words , when I <unk> that <unk> the <unk> , <unk> that the machine <unk> , which is a great <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if this was to do <unk> <unk> than this , when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the page was this .
That means we had a <unk> impact over to that scientific impact .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine works when the <unk> works .
Now , the <unk> between you <unk> and <unk> , &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot;
And instead they can do that because when they &apos;re very <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees , at a temperature <unk> to that of the space between stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> between the <unk> <unk> , there was a <unk> of <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
This was the <unk> .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and that &apos;s <unk> about 30 <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We &apos;ve <unk> them and <unk> .
Now , they &apos;re now <unk> all the place to their <unk> .
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> will be again again .
<unk> , and we <unk> to get data to <unk> or <unk> , and continue so our <unk> to find out what are the <unk> that are the <unk> that <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in some way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> value of science and engineering engineering <unk> . It &apos;s easy to be <unk> .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact that it &apos;s the value of things like <unk> .
I want to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> , in <unk> of <unk> experiments , his <unk> was Michael <unk> , and he said , &quot; No is <unk> for the progress of human mind how the <unk> that ideas of human mind is <unk> , that there are no <unk> to <unk> , and our <unk> <unk> <unk> , and our <unk> are <unk> , and <unk> <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to when , from children , <unk> with <unk> .
<unk> as <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects , with <unk> objects , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started to <unk> , &quot; And if , when we use a computer , instead of having the <unk> only <unk> of <unk> as digital <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> with both hands , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that I thought I was going to explore the answer , building the <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a big <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a big <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , they can <unk> them , and they &apos;re <unk> , and they have a screen and radio <unk> .
But <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> it .
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> the digital information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement , of others , and as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement , of others , of the other , of how we can explore new <unk> and <unk> of <unk> .
I &apos;m going to start with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show video , if you <unk> it in a direction , the <unk> video , the <unk> video <unk> , if we <unk> from the other side .
These <unk> are <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , you &apos;re going to go around .
If they &apos;re <unk> , <unk> and they can <unk> it a little bit .
If they &apos;re <unk> , <unk> and they can <unk> it a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We realized that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was the <unk> that we could use common data on the data , for example , if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as <unk> of <unk> and I can <unk> for <unk> color in that central color , where you &apos;re <unk> .
and I can <unk> for <unk> color in that central color , where you &apos;re <unk> .
If we &apos;re too <unk> , we can <unk> a little bit .
I &apos;m also <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> , and <unk> and games where people can try things , and <unk> and <unk> the results to try and <unk> the <unk> immediately .
I &apos;m now --
This is a <unk> sequence I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a game of words that is <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , at all <unk> <unk> a letter to each <unk> , <unk> , at every <unk> , <unk> a letter to case , and <unk> a letter to each <unk> , and <unk> of them to <unk> words on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds <unk> , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
So here &apos;s the children <unk> in <unk> <unk> , I made them up and <unk> them and <unk> them and <unk> them a video .
They &apos;re <unk> very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things that kind of <unk> is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just wanted to say , &quot; <unk> of words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , and on the right .
In fact , he wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> a tool for the <unk> of <unk> . He &apos;s <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now , it has a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : <unk> .
<unk> work ! Yes !
So we <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with the <unk> , and it can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with the <unk> , and it can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> away , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have the time to show you is a <unk> , that &apos;s <unk> , to <unk> and <unk> music .
It &apos;s a <unk> , made of recently , to <unk> and <unk> music .
<unk> here from <unk> as <unk> <unk> , and <unk> .
<unk> of these four different <unk> , and you can choose which to use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of <unk> to your <unk> .
And I just wanted to do a <unk> , &quot; and a <unk> . &quot;
These are actually , you can control from live , like the <unk> and <unk> .
I &apos;m going to <unk> a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are the effects of <unk> as time and <unk> , that <unk> to the whole sequence .
<unk> how it works .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> , &quot; sequence , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , other <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m going to take a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> : Now , I &apos;m going to go up .
<unk> : <unk> : And now I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> , so I can control the <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the entire sequence time from one or on the other .
<unk> : <unk> : And now I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> to give more <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the sequence &quot; <unk> . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And now , finally , I finally , I can <unk> the entire sequence on the left the <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain work and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this path , and some <unk> that we &apos;re trying to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to <unk> is that it &apos;s <unk> this new generation of objects for <unk> <unk> , that <unk> information in our world in the way we want to do .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time of talking to you .
I &apos;m a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it &apos;s more than this , of course .
It &apos;s also love and love of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like that can change .
But , I said this , something particular happened in my life and in my career , which has brought me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I wrote this book , this <unk> called &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which , <unk> from my <unk> books , for some reason in the world and <unk> a great <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the <unk> is that everywhere , I &apos;m going to be <unk> as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I &apos;m going to be <unk> and I &apos;m going to say , &quot; You don &apos;t get any <unk> to do better ?
You don &apos;t have any <unk> to go to write for all life without being able to create a book that can <unk> somebody ? &quot;
What can you do ? &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , to part of that I remember more than 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to go to the same <unk> from fear .
And people said , &quot; I &apos;m not going to be able to have success ?
You don &apos;t have any <unk> that the <unk> <unk> ?
You don &apos;t have any <unk> for all life without any <unk> that nothing to come out and die on a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with the mouth of <unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> of <unk> ? &quot;
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I &apos;m afraid of all those things .
I always had fear .
And I &apos;m afraid of many other things that people can &apos;t <unk> .
As <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as I &apos;m going to write what I thought and <unk> <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It &apos;s <unk> that anyone who <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel to do .
But what &apos;s really about in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> are not doing ?
As my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I didn &apos;t know one time in his <unk> years of activity in which he was asked if he was <unk> ?
<unk> was that -- that <unk> of John <unk> , like <unk> ?
I don &apos;t want to do that , <unk> ?
<unk> , the engineers like group didn &apos;t have , in the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> .
We have enough , we have enough , and not only <unk> but <unk> of any kind of , we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
And I &apos;m not going to look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> , young and often for them .
And even the ones that are not <unk> to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before you die , in the last <unk> said , &quot; Every book I <unk> a little bit more &quot; A <unk> about work of your life .
But I didn &apos;t know that when I &apos;m going to say , because we heard these things so long , we &apos;ve got <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are <unk> that creativity and <unk> are somehow <unk> and that art , at the end , and that art , and that art , and <unk> to the <unk> .
And the question I want to go to all over here today is : you &apos;re <unk> with this idea ?
It &apos;s going to be well this thing -- because it &apos;s going to be <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
I think it &apos;s <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s also <unk> and I don &apos;t want to go into the next century .
I think it &apos;s better <unk> our <unk> <unk> to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to <unk> <unk> to that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I &apos;m in my career .
<unk> -- <unk> look at , I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;ve about 40 years .
I still have about four <unk> of work .
And it &apos;s very <unk> that any thing about it in the world , as the work that <unk> after the world , as the work that <unk> after my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we &apos;re all <unk> friends here -- is <unk> that my biggest <unk> is my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , that thought !
You know , this is the kind of <unk> that leads a person to start <unk> <unk> at nine nine of the morning and I don &apos;t want to do that .
I &apos;m going to continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so I think , after many <unk> , that the way to work to continue to write is that to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to have some <unk> <unk> from me , which I &apos;m <unk> , and my natural <unk> about which <unk> that <unk> that <unk> to get to the <unk> of that this year , as we &apos;re going to look at the way , trying to find other society , trying to find other society to find out of the time , trying to see if we &apos;re going to have the best ideas and more <unk> .
as help people <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
because they went into <unk> and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don &apos;t believe that creativity <unk> creativity from men , OK ?
It turns out that creativity was this spirit <unk> and <unk> to men from a few <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for <unk> reasons .
<unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity . &quot;
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from far .
The <unk> were of the same idea , but I <unk> that sort of <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> , because the <unk> doesn &apos;t really <unk> that a <unk> was a <unk> .
I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that was literally <unk> in the <unk> of the study of an artist , a little bit like <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> out of <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the <unk> of that work .
<unk> <unk> here , that &apos;s the distance of the distance I &apos;m talking about -- that <unk> you &apos;re going to <unk> you from your work .
And everybody <unk> that was so <unk> , right ?
So the artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like for example , the too <unk> , no ?
If your work was <unk> <unk> <unk> all the <unk> , all <unk> that <unk> was <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it wasn &apos;t all your <unk> , right ?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and everything <unk> , and <unk> this big idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe , and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> this big idea .
This was the <unk> principle and <unk> and people <unk> to think that creativity is completely <unk> by <unk> .
And for the first time in the history , you start to <unk> to this or the artist as a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think that was a big <unk> .
I think I &apos;m going to try and somebody , a simple person to believe that being a source , <unk> and <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a responsibility to give us a responsibility to give us a <unk> too much to give us to <unk> human <unk> .
It &apos;s like to somebody &apos;s <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s been this pressure to have <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years .
And , if that &apos;s true , and I think that &apos;s , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do that ?
<unk> go back to a <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can &apos;t <unk> 500 years of thinking about a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , do that <unk> people <unk> to <unk> <unk> on their projects .
I &apos;m probably not going to tell you all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to say , &quot; Why ?
Why don &apos;t we <unk> this way ?
Because it &apos;s more sense of everything else that has ever heard to explain the <unk> <unk> <unk> process .
A process that , as anyone who ever ever <unk> to do something -- so , basically , all of that -- and so , you don &apos;t get <unk> .
And , in fact , it can sometimes be completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the incredible <unk> <unk> , who has now 90 years , but it &apos;s been a <unk> for all life and me that during her <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out of the <unk> , and I <unk> it , and I <unk> it , and I <unk> it , in the <unk> from the <unk> .
He said , &quot; I was like a <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> to her from <unk> .
I <unk> it , because he had <unk> the land under its feet .
I decided to have one thing to do at that point and was , words , &quot; <unk> as a <unk> . &quot;
And so he went to home and he was <unk> by this <unk> , and he didn &apos;t have to take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> to the page .
<unk> times I didn &apos;t want to be enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> them without <unk> to get into the house , and he would <unk> them up through the <unk> , trying to <unk> , how she said , &quot; another <unk> . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this piece never <unk> -- there were no moments . There were moments ,
So , he was <unk> at home and he was trying to the paper and <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> a <unk> <unk> in the while he was <unk> , and he said , that he was like if you <unk> with the other hand and <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> and the <unk> in his body and <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the page , and <unk> , but at the <unk> , from the last word .
So when I <unk> it -- it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not all my <unk> process -- I &apos;m not a <unk> !
I &apos;m a <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> is ; I <unk> at the same <unk> every day and <unk> and work and <unk> <unk> over .
But even I went to my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I thought that many of you the <unk> <unk> .
You know , even though the work and ideas me <unk> me from a certain source I could not <unk> <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> to it in a way to do not <unk> to do the head , but , that <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
And I &apos;m going to , the best example , I &apos;m the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;ve <unk> different years ago for a <unk> .
<unk> of this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> <unk> , trying to control , <unk> , <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> , <unk> these species of <unk> .
But then <unk> , he was <unk> , and a day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , <unk> everything .
<unk> fast and everything from a <unk> <unk> , that &apos;s <unk> <unk> , that &apos;s in his head as <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the <unk> , but not how to <unk> us .
It doesn &apos;t have a paper <unk> , it doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , it &apos;s not a <unk> .
So , it starts to hear this kind of old <unk> <unk> in him like , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and <unk> <unk> from this <unk> song .
I &apos;m not <unk> enough and I can &apos;t <unk> . &quot;
And instead of going to go into the <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> .
<unk> the whole process of <unk> and made something completely new .
I just wanted the sky and said , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , you see I &apos;m <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Do you think that can write a song ?
If you really want to <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , if you really want to take care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And his process <unk> <unk> after this .
It didn &apos;t work , the work was still <unk> as <unk> .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> , the <unk> that he was <unk> , the <unk> that he was , <unk> that he had to be a <unk> thing and <unk> .
but I <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> and this <unk> and <unk> , but it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
So how I &apos;m going to change that story to change a little bit of a little bit of it , and I &apos;m going to get a time .
This idea , I &apos;m going to be when I was <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; and <unk> in one of those <unk> <unk> in which we &apos;re <unk> all when we &apos;re working on something and we can &apos;t think that &apos;s going to be a <unk> , that that &apos;s <unk> book , which is going to be the book , which is going to be the book , &quot; and that &apos;s going to be the <unk> , and that &apos;s going to be the <unk> ,
Not just <unk> , just the <unk> book .
And I started thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I &apos;m going to <unk> that <unk> up to the air and <unk> .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> corner of the room .
And I said , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; What , we know that if this book is not going to be <unk> my , no ?
Because as you see I &apos;m going to take you all over that I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to <unk> and do your own part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do that , you know , you don &apos;t know .
I started to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to please that it was <unk> that I &apos;m <unk> to do my own <unk> . &quot; Because -- I &apos;m going to be <unk> to the <unk> of Africa &apos;s Africa , OK -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and music and music that will be <unk> to the moon .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk> .
But every while , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these artists in fact , <unk> .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you have all of them , at some point , a <unk> .
It was like the time <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and he was not doing anything different from the <unk> , like <unk> <unk> before , but everything was <unk> .
And suddenly , not <unk> as a human .
But it &apos;s <unk> from <unk> and <unk> in fire of the <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , he had his name .
<unk> your hands and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , &quot; God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which you can still feel in <unk> or <unk> .
In <unk> , when a artist had something impossible to impossible and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot;
And it &apos;s <unk> because we need .
But the problem comes the day , for the <unk> , when you <unk> and <unk> and <unk> that are 11 <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> God &apos;s <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> God &apos;s <unk> .
It &apos;s just a <unk> with <unk> , and maybe not <unk> to <unk> that <unk> .
And maybe no one <unk> the name of God , and what &apos;s going to do with her life ?
It &apos;s difficult .
This is one of the <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe not to <unk> <unk> , <unk> if you can &apos;t believe , <unk> , <unk> the <unk> <unk> , that the most <unk> are from you .
But I just wanted to you data from a <unk> of this <unk> part of your life that &apos;s going to go to <unk> you to <unk> the other when you &apos;re finished .
And , you know , if we think that way it all changes .
And so I started to <unk> , and it &apos;s certainly like I <unk> for several months in the <unk> of the book that was soon , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , I don &apos;t fear .
Don &apos;t <unk> . It &apos;s just your work .
<unk> to your own part , any one can be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , you &apos;re going to be <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for one moment through your <unk> , for only time through your <unk> , &quot;
<unk> , you do the same <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to say , &quot; I &apos;m going to do it .
I think I &apos;m going to think about it , and I think you &apos;re <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; <unk> ! &quot; I just had love with the human love and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> : <unk> !
As I &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , on what can <unk> and <unk> of the discovery of genes .
We &apos;re going to <unk> a new <unk> : we started to <unk> biology and now to start from that digital code , we &apos;re <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We &apos;ve always been trying to <unk> <unk> questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; What is something that many <unk> I think they &apos;re <unk> to understand .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> terms .
We &apos;re <unk> from almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome is <unk> to go from the world to <unk> the digital world of computers .
Now , we can <unk> the life , or to create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the most small <unk> of those that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce <unk> the genome to <unk> a little bit more .
We can <unk> a <unk> of genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we take a look at his map , it &apos;s just <unk> than our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at the time , it &apos;s very <unk> that this can bring a <unk> cell .
So I thought the only <unk> away was this <unk> in a way to <unk> <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of &quot; Can we <unk> a <unk> ? &quot;
Can the chemistry chemistry of making these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been to create before ?
And in case , we can make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that we are able to <unk> the life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our capacity to write the code , instead , <unk> rather slowly , but it &apos;s <unk> .
And our <unk> results in a <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> many <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before <unk> the first experiments .
But we found that DNA <unk> is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> little <unk> of DNA , of <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> process : <unk> <unk> is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , there are .
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , to <unk> from the <unk> information <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a little virus that <unk> .
We designed <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> and we <unk> it in the bacteria , the bacteria <unk> to read this <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> particles .
<unk> particles have been <unk> by cells , they &apos;re <unk> back and <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I talked about recently with the <unk> industry that they &apos;ve got to do this model .
They &apos;ve <unk> more than you .
<unk> that this is a situation where software can really build its own <unk> system .
But I &apos;m going to do the <unk> things in big .
<unk> building the entire <unk> of <unk> .
They &apos;re more than <unk> <unk> <unk> of code .
So we thought we &apos;re going to <unk> in the size of the virus , so that we can change the <unk> to understand what are the <unk> of a cell <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if we <unk> with <unk> information in a computer , these have to be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in the <unk> <unk> was of a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We found , 30 , 30 <unk> . If we could use that original sequence never <unk> states that .
A part of the process is design <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to all the other <unk> <unk> to build smaller <unk> that <unk> together .
<unk> elements here .
You probably have read that there &apos;s probably <unk> us .
So we have a <unk> code that we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , and there &apos;s a <unk> order to <unk> <unk> for every <unk> .
So we can use the code <unk> to write words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did was at the beginning was <unk> .
Some of them have been <unk> by the fact that it was not <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> simply <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started <unk> parts , <unk> with <unk> <unk> from five to seven <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to them to them <unk> <unk> to them to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , we <unk> this <unk> in <unk> so that we &apos;re <unk> to make a very <unk> <unk> <unk> as you see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to <unk> the process .
So , this seems the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When we start these <unk> very <unk> , more than 100 <unk> <unk> , no longer <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s coming to the <unk> of the tools of <unk> biology .
So we &apos;ve <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA .
So here &apos;s an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In 12 hours , it &apos;s <unk> , as it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely .
You live under <unk> .
They &apos;re absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and they &apos;re <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
In fact , NASA has shown this .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we built using these <unk> , simply using these <unk> , by <unk> design <unk> .
<unk> <unk> them .
This picture , not been <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that I &apos;m going to be a <unk> of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> that we did a little time ago .
They &apos;re more <unk> <unk> of <unk> code .
It &apos;s the largest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> that has ever <unk> from man .
It has a <unk> <unk> <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a 10 <unk> without spaces , we &apos;re going to <unk> pages to <unk> this <unk> code .
Now , how do we do that work ? How can we <unk> ?
Of course , through a virus is a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a little bit more <unk> when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s <unk> when it &apos;s <unk> cells like our : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the process of <unk> .
In <unk> , the <unk> is instead of <unk> in the cell , but we &apos;ve <unk> that we are able to do a <unk> <unk> from a cell <unk> from a cell <unk> from a cell cell cell phone and <unk> .
We &apos;ve <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> .
The two are different as the men from <unk> .
We &apos;ve <unk> some <unk> in a way that you could decide what to choose to choose what to choose to do .
He <unk> it with the <unk> <unk> in a way to <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell , and we <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> went into the cell .
And we thought I was <unk> that we didn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to <unk> it in there .
This is one of the largest <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> from some of the <unk> , <unk> in a second thousands of <unk> to that species .
So , who think about evolution as a only <unk> at the time you <unk> , it doesn &apos;t have much of biology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell phone .
<unk> <unk> that we <unk> it .
It &apos;s <unk> , and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material , and we <unk> with only the cell , and we &apos;re <unk> with only the cell phone and the new <unk> .
It became blue because of the genes that we &apos;ve <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species went to <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> of all in a new species , <unk> on software that we &apos;ve <unk> in the cell cell cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the <unk> code exactly the <unk> <unk> exactly what we &apos;ve <unk> .
Now , this may be <unk> <unk> , but we <unk> the DNA software , we can change things in a <unk> way .
Now , I &apos;ve already <unk> that here is not about <unk> -- but of progress from three million years and a half million years and a half years and a half of evolution , and I &apos;ve already said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the <unk> in which we &apos;re going to <unk> new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think that &apos;s enough to be <unk> when we think of our <unk> .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give a example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in <unk> ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re <unk> problems now to find food , water <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for six billion and <unk> for six billion people .
<unk> even more <unk> to do that for nine billion .
<unk> than five billion <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> .
That means percent of <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process of <unk> , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
In the <unk> we have to realize the whole <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> into the atmosphere .
<unk> today , <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> all over the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I love to think that are <unk> for the future .
The industry <unk> only one about <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here are <unk> data from the reality of <unk> and our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , because of these <unk> <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think of these 20 million genes , and <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology <unk> .
And it &apos;s just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> <unk> , chemistry or chemistry , production of <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software that we &apos;re working on for being able to <unk> and design species to the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly how their <unk> code .
Now we &apos;re going to go on the <unk> generation of <unk> .
You saw that <unk> <unk> from <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We have <unk> <unk> , third generation that will be pretty soon by <unk> <unk> <unk> than <unk> or different <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> the CO2 in matter before , which we &apos;re working on , for which we &apos;re working for cells , and we think that we can achieve that first <unk> to be able to have this purpose , and we think that we can reach the first <unk> of <unk> <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> <unk> <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> , and found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk> .
It &apos;s going to be <unk> feet to the temperature of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> from the CO2 using <unk> as <unk> .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2 , that can easily be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , we think that we can be able to <unk> what the question of the basic question , &quot; which is life is the <unk> of us , we <unk> the <unk> goal of <unk> the entire <unk> industry .
<unk> . If you can &apos;t do that from TED , where can &apos;t it from TED , where ?
It &apos;s a main source of energy .
<unk> , we &apos;re working for using the same <unk> to create <unk> .
You saw this year with the flu , we &apos;re always back to a year and with a dollar <unk> <unk> when it is to find the right <unk> .
I think that that &apos;s going to change building <unk> in <unk> .
So , how the future could start to look at <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and finally <unk> cells .
We &apos;re so <unk> from the people .
Our goal is to do in a way of living long enough to try to <unk> . Thank you very much .
First of all , I &apos;m going to show you , the <unk> possible , some <unk> , of the new technology that we brought to a <unk> <unk> almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
It &apos;s about a environment in which you can <unk> is at local level that <unk> with a huge amount of data <unk> .
Here we &apos;re seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a quick <unk> , <unk> images , <unk> images like we want to do .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big <unk> of data or images .
Most of them are common photographs , but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in any time . It &apos;s also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a book , example of data , which is not images .
This is the <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , I &apos;m going to say that it &apos;s not about images , we can do something like that , to make sure that &apos;s really a real <unk> of the text .
It may be a little <unk> to read a little <unk> book .
I don &apos;t tell you .
This is an example of <unk> . It &apos;s a number of <unk> .
Every picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the <unk> and the beautiful experience of how the real version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature of a <unk> , which is for nature of a <unk> .
We also made something with the corner of this particular number of the <unk> .
We &apos;ve created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much <unk> than that you use in a normal <unk> and we <unk> <unk> .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
I thought that this <unk> will be <unk> and other <unk> <unk> , not to be <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the most <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if we don &apos;t have any time to say that we &apos;re going to lose to be in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. <unk> <unk> .
So now I &apos;m going to try something else .
This is actually live from the Web ; you can <unk> it to see .
It &apos;s a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
A <unk> , and the other is a <unk> <unk> to the computer <unk> , a very interesting student of <unk> , a student of <unk> , with the help of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> . A <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s live on the Web , <unk> by <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from one of the other and have this kind of experience to <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of images here , actually a meaning .
<unk> <unk> of the computer <unk> have been <unk> these images together , so that we &apos;re going to <unk> to the <unk> places that are <unk> all <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> . So here you see the elements of a <unk> or <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> to <unk> <unk> or <unk> , and these things have been all <unk> to <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot of <unk> .
I want to go to one of the <unk> data <unk> and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that we &apos;ve done for the first time , the first time , for the first time , to show you what &apos;s really the key to do . And it &apos;s not <unk> as <unk> as <unk> by the <unk> of the website . And it &apos;s not <unk> as <unk> by looking at the Web .
We had to <unk> <unk> and <unk> and so on .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> and <unk> images of these <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> . <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> a picture that &apos;s <unk> by this model that you have <unk> to this model of this model .
So they &apos;re all <unk> images from <unk> and have been all <unk> to <unk> <unk> in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to <unk> in this <unk> way .
You know , I never thought to end up to work .
It &apos;s very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think we &apos;ll see that it &apos;s a lot of different kinds of <unk> : from those cell phones to those <unk> <unk> , a number <unk> , <unk> <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to look at those <unk> .
A lot of <unk> are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
<unk> here is a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from the <unk> to the physics of this environment .
The point is that we can do things with the environment . This is now <unk> data from the whole memory of how we <unk> the land from the whole memory of how we <unk> the land , from the point of view and <unk> all those data together .
All those pictures become <unk> together , the <unk> of the parts .
You have a model of the land that <unk> .
Think about this as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on Earth <unk> .
It &apos;s something that we &apos;re going to be in complexity , and the <unk> for those who <unk> it with the use of use .
Their picture are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people .
If somebody &apos;s the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name , my <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of those data , and I can use as a <unk> point to <unk> in that space , in that <unk> , using the picture of the <unk> of the kind of <unk> and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of this is <unk> models of every part of the land , not just by <unk> <unk> and <unk> images and <unk> images .
<unk> .
Chris Anderson : I understand that ? What &apos;s your software ? What your software is going to be <unk> to a certain point in the next few years , all the photographs of the world are basically going to be <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yes . What &apos;s doing is that it &apos;s <unk> .
It &apos;s creating <unk> , if you want , in these images .
And it &apos;s doing that in the <unk> of images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> information that many of these images .
As when you do a research <unk> , you <unk> a <unk> and the text and the text on the page , it &apos;s the <unk> page , and the page on the <unk> page .
Now , what if that picture <unk> you &apos;re going to <unk> all your pictures ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really huge . It &apos;s a <unk> effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it &apos;s really incredible .
<unk> : <unk> you very much .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is the <unk> that we don &apos;t have <unk> the <unk> <unk> , between who has been <unk> , between the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to think that <unk> <unk> still <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> <unk> still the <unk> of the <unk> , to remember the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , and that the idea that the world in which we live in there is just a model of <unk> , but it &apos;s just a model of reality , but it &apos;s actually ,
<unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , well , many <unk> , many <unk> <unk> .
And of course , all <unk> <unk> <unk> .
All <unk> . All <unk> . <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We have to <unk> the <unk> of death , so we don &apos;t get us if you could <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art .
What <unk> is the <unk> of the song , the <unk> of the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that they &apos;re the <unk> of <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> .
He was my <unk> of journey in <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> , on the <unk> , on the <unk> , the mother &apos;s <unk> , the mother &apos;s <unk> .
All of these <unk> us that are <unk> of other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And if you <unk> a second , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and <unk> that <unk> the planet and is important to <unk> the planet as <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> total <unk> of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being from the human imagination .
<unk> is the great <unk> of humanity .
It &apos;s the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as <unk> species .
And <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has been <unk> to <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the <unk> of the <unk> simply because it &apos;s <unk> , or -- in the <unk> of the <unk> of diversity -- and you don &apos;t even get to the <unk> <unk> -- that <unk> diversity .
The <unk> of that is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just <unk> from a <unk> or a series of <unk> rules .
One language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle with which the <unk> of every culture is in the world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we &apos;re sitting here at least half , the <unk> is not <unk> in the <unk> of the children .
They &apos;re not <unk> to children , the <unk> that means , <unk> that they &apos;re already <unk> .
What &apos;s the <unk> of being <unk> by <unk> , of the last to talk about a language , of the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the children ?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of somebody in some of the world every two weeks : every two weeks , every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and <unk> with it in the <unk> <unk> <unk> of a language .
And I know somebody who &apos;s <unk> , &quot; <unk> &apos;t that ?
The world would not be a better place if we <unk> all the same language ? &quot; <unk> , then we all have <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> a <unk> thing that means that we can &apos;t talk about their own language .
I &apos;d like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
a small journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we &apos;re <unk> .
Many of us , many of us , many ways of <unk> , &quot; I mean different ways of <unk> .
So , for example , this <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , which <unk> to the <unk> <unk> from the river of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> that doesn &apos;t have able to <unk> the blue color from green because the blue <unk> , because the <unk> is <unk> in the time of the forest , which <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , you have a <unk> <unk> , <unk> a different language .
All of that has <unk> in the past <unk> , and <unk> is that in these families , where you &apos;re talking about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> no one language .
You start to listen and then I started talking about .
I &apos;m going to have a <unk> of the most interesting <unk> with which I lived , the <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
They did <unk> by the top photographs that <unk> them in <unk> that <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> <unk> forest had never seen anything .
They <unk> the picture from the land , the <unk> to a form or a <unk> and , not <unk> <unk> , they <unk> that <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk> .
But the <unk> not only <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> between them .
<unk> percent of the <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We went to eight <unk> and we found two cases of <unk> and when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was so <unk> that he was <unk> , and then they <unk> it .
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> species .
<unk> years old , I was <unk> a really interesting task when my <unk> <unk> me if my <unk> <unk> me , if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> between the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> to make the <unk> .
So , to give a sense of <unk> culture , and that <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s quite a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Very interesting .
If you &apos;re going to <unk> the great <unk> of the world , what <unk> me ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent is always <unk> out , thinking that Africa has no <unk> <unk> . And instead , and the <unk> is not the other than the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> very <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
What makes it interesting is the <unk> of the <unk> of life and death .
So the <unk> are doing <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by <unk> <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of live in a little bit of the <unk> becomes the <unk> .
So , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , you go into <unk> to talk to God &apos;s about God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re <unk> , is the spirit that <unk> you , how do you do it ,
So , you &apos;re going to be <unk> to these incredible events . <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> rather <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> rather than the power of the body &apos;s mind .
<unk> all the <unk> with which I lived the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> civilization that once <unk> <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> never had been <unk> by <unk> .
<unk> today are <unk> by a <unk> , but their <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> are <unk> away from <unk> to <unk> , and live in a world &apos;s <unk> and <unk> in a world &apos;s <unk> and <unk> in a world &apos;s <unk> to <unk> to <unk> at the basis of the <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> of nine years of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
For this time , they &apos;re <unk> to the values of their own society , values that <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> .
And so , in this incredible <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> out and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 , and in that moment of <unk> . And in that moment of <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk> , everything that they learned in <unk> <unk> . And all that they &apos;ve learned in <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , everything that was <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ? <unk> as I said . &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> . Now , it &apos;s going to be <unk> . &quot;
They call a major <unk> and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world .
This is a very important level .
When we think about the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> history of <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> in his <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these are <unk> <unk> to the Earth &apos;s <unk> to us .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> <unk> by <unk> .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> , but because of the time and <unk> , <unk> , have created a <unk> of Earth &apos;s <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . And the concept that the Earth can only to be because it &apos;s <unk> by human <unk> .
What does that mean ?
I mean , a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> <unk> that <unk> its <unk> is going to be a different <unk> and has a <unk> relationship or that place to a <unk> of <unk> that <unk> <unk> that <unk> a mountain or place to be <unk> .
That &apos;s the <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is that the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
And that made me a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> .
If we start to <unk> that these <unk> can create different , <unk> , we start to understand some of them <unk> . <unk> this <unk> .
I <unk> this picture at <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What makes it fascinating is not the potential <unk> of the <unk> , but its <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> by two elements .
On one side , this <unk> <unk> that <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> a little bit of <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> with the <unk> of a family family family &apos;s family &apos;s <unk> said <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to the <unk> , <unk> .
If you &apos;re going to see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> that make a different <unk> of species , <unk> it <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea <unk> of electricity . <unk> &apos;t make a <unk> of reality ; it &apos;s not a <unk> of reality ; it &apos;s a <unk> of reality .
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> was <unk> , with his <unk> <unk> <unk> in the &apos; <unk> .
<unk> my <unk> can &apos;t be <unk> , you can &apos;t tell you these <unk> because if you &apos;re not doing any <unk> .
It &apos;s possible to be <unk> if we could only <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now , the <unk> that are <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> of <unk> , of the same kind of <unk> to <unk> the <unk> . <unk> : <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> species , like these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that if you <unk> in this way , they make these <unk> <unk> <unk> . And if you &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> ?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you <unk> to the <unk> , &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot;
What does that mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that our eyes will be <unk> in the same species .
If you <unk> how they <unk> their <unk> <unk> us , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; You know , &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take the <unk> <unk> in a night of the moon and <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
With this doesn &apos;t <unk> us to <unk> , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> .
Now , &#91; <unk> &#93; the &#93; problem is that the problem with the <unk> <unk> , but somehow <unk> them are <unk> , but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of the history of the history of the history of the real world , and <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , between 300 years , not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk> , but rather like the <unk> was in which we &apos;ve been <unk> and we <unk> or <unk> <unk> the <unk> of mass <unk> of diversity and <unk> . Now the problem is not the problem .
All the <unk> were <unk> in a <unk> for new <unk> for new <unk> .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , as they <unk> <unk> and <unk> as <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> as the <unk> didn &apos;t have <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> from <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It &apos;s the power .
<unk> <unk> .
And if you look at a <unk> in the world , <unk> that these are not <unk> to <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> creatures and <unk> out of the <unk> <unk> that go beyond their <unk> capacity .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that has been <unk> in the forest to a generation , and now <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> , where you can see the river <unk> , where you can see the river <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are the disease that are <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> .
If we &apos;re going to go on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I &apos;m doing a lot of <unk> , you &apos;ll see the <unk> <unk> of politics .
As <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , is <unk> to <unk> , but <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of life , not only is not just <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it &apos;s part of the development of development .
And you can &apos;t understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you go from the beginning .
I &apos;ve got the <unk> miles from <unk> in China through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> to <unk> what I realized there is the <unk> that I &apos;m going to talk about .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
The father &apos;s father <unk> at the <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that means that it was <unk> to the <unk> time of Chinese .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk> .
It was <unk> to <unk> at the age of two <unk> under his <unk> because he didn &apos;t have to live without him .
<unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
One day he <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and for this <unk> , was <unk> to work for seven years .
<unk> <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of <unk> is <unk> by <unk> .
<unk> , all of it <unk> to a choice .
<unk> to live in the world &apos;s <unk> or we want to <unk> the world &apos;s <unk> of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died said that his greatest <unk> was , in our <unk> to this <unk> vision of the world , not only <unk> the entire <unk> of the world &apos;s imagination , not only <unk> the entire imagination of human imagination , but one day , we <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that were there .
And it &apos;s <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
<unk> <unk> , which has given us to us to the <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
<unk> world has to <unk> 300 years .
That <unk> story , I didn &apos;t know that we have the answers to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to come to come .
When at these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
And that &apos;s in these answers that we all <unk> the opportunity to be what we are : a <unk> species , that has to <unk> them . And there are great moments of moments of <unk> . And there are great moments of <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> of the island of <unk> , when I went to <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> me , <unk> , <unk> me , he <unk> the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The government didn &apos;t have been <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the &apos; <unk> for <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
The family , <unk> for her life , the <unk> away all the <unk> , and all of her <unk> .
You know , you know that <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
The <unk> <unk> were made of fish .
The <unk> of this man didn &apos;t <unk> from the night or from the <unk> that <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> away , you get the <unk> in <unk> <unk> and <unk> in their hand . When I did <unk> , <unk> , <unk> them , has <unk> , <unk> by creating a <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> of <unk> and when <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> created a <unk> , has <unk> another dog and it &apos;s <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> to talk about <unk> with nothing ?
<unk> <unk> the government <unk> has <unk> to <unk> the <unk> control of a larger area of California and <unk> <unk> together .
It &apos;s their new <unk> . It &apos;s called <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> all the resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , to finish , I think , I think it &apos;s quite <unk> to who are in these <unk> <unk> <unk> of the planet , <unk> that they &apos;re not <unk> at all .
For somebody &apos;s house .
<unk> <unk> of human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the time . And for us all , the dreams of these children , are part of the <unk> of hope .
<unk> , we &apos;re <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to anything .
<unk> that <unk> --
&#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; , but we believe that stories can change the world , and perhaps we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our site <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our audience in places of <unk> <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> out of how they saw and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> for a <unk> world &apos;s <unk> in diversity , and we have to find a <unk> world of diversity , and we have to find a <unk> world of diversity in a <unk> world , and we have to find a <unk> world in a <unk> world .
where the <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some of the things that I hope to <unk> other things that I hope you &apos;ve heard about it and <unk> some <unk> , in case , you know , you know ,
I want to start with what I call &quot; the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
<unk> <unk> ?
<unk> <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; If we want to <unk> our own citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; The way to do it is <unk> the freedom . &quot;
The reason is , from one side in the fact that the freedom is <unk> , is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> for human beings .
<unk> is the fact that if we &apos;re <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> , each of us can do it for all that we &apos;re going to <unk> our <unk> , without any of the name .
The way to <unk> the freedom is <unk> choice .
<unk> people have , more <unk> , and more <unk> is their <unk> , and more <unk> is their <unk> .
This , <unk> , is so <unk> <unk> in society that no one <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it &apos;s also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made .
This is my <unk> . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to have a simple <unk> on <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> and 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> that you can buy a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> that you can buy a huge number of <unk> in your <unk> that there is your <unk> .
This is how the <unk> .
Then you go to the store <unk> to buy a <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there &apos;s a big number of <unk> .
We can make six million and a half million different <unk> using <unk> that there are in one store .
<unk> <unk> that there is choice .
<unk> <unk> : the world &apos;s <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the <unk> services , to <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , not <unk> it .
A <unk> of that , between the other , was that the phone doesn &apos;t ever <unk> .
These days they went .
We have now a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , especially between <unk> .
Here &apos;s cell phones .
My <unk> is that in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
If you don &apos;t even have seen in the store , you &apos;re <unk> certain that soon .
And what the end is going on is that people go into the <unk> and does this question . And you know , is the answer ? The answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t make things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> &apos;t happening in the United States that you &apos;re going to be <unk> and the <unk> you have to do .
Instead , <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> says , &quot; OK , we could do it , or <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> . What do you do ? &quot;
You know , &quot; <unk> , what do you do ? &quot;
And the <unk> says , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> and these <unk> . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; <unk> if she was me , what <unk> ? &quot;
And the <unk> , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The <unk> we call &quot; <unk> &quot; , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> that makes it seem to be a beautiful thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not that one <unk> the weight and the responsibility for someone who knows something , <unk> the <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> , and so not in the <unk> <unk> to make decisions the patient .
There &apos;s a huge <unk> of products , <unk> to people like me and you , that if you think about it doesn &apos;t make any sense , because we can &apos;t think about it .
But if we can &apos;t <unk> , because we <unk> them ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> that we call the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> of how fundamental is our <unk> <unk> is a question of choice , as you see in this <unk> , &quot; Don &apos;t want to <unk> kids . We want to <unk> the children . They &apos;re not going to be a <unk> : we have to <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
that means that every <unk> , at the <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
<unk> to the family and <unk> , a time , <unk> the common perspective , almost for anyone , was that you <unk> the <unk> <unk> , and you can get to children the <unk> to the <unk> .
The only one of choice was with who , when , and even what to do after .
<unk> , all of it &apos;s really to play .
<unk> students to a lot of smart , and they <unk> their 20 percent in less work than a time .
And because they &apos;re not <unk> , because they &apos;re not <unk> .
but why I &apos;m <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> or no ? <unk> do that ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> later ? I have to think before kids or <unk> ? &quot;
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
And they &apos;re trying to answer these questions , even if this <unk> doesn &apos;t <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and not get a beautiful <unk> at my <unk> .
And they have to do that . They have to do that . They have to do that . They have to do that . They have to do that . They have to do that .
Now , the work : we &apos;re <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because technology <unk> us to work every minute , every day , <unk> that <unk> from <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> , and I &apos;m not going to tell you about nobody , where the <unk> works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What does that mean , this incredible <unk> of choice that we have to do this work ? It &apos;s that we have to decide , <unk> at all time , if we have to work or no .
We can go to see our son to <unk> , with the mobile phone in a <unk> , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , on the <unk> .
And even though they &apos;re all <unk> , every minute that we see our son <unk> , we &apos;re also <unk> , &quot; I have to answer this ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this <unk> ? I have to <unk> this letter ? &quot;
And when the answer is , &quot; no , this makes the <unk> experience of your son , very different from what it would have been in other conditions .
So , from any <unk> , we look at little things , and large , objects and <unk> and <unk> , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but not everything was a <unk> of choice .
The world today &apos;s <unk> to this : <unk> is a <unk> thing , or <unk> ?
The answer is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> them all , so I &apos;m going to talk about the <unk> .
<unk> this choice two two two effects of people .
The first , <unk> , is that <unk> instead of <unk> .
With many <unk> in which choose , it becomes very difficult to do that .
I &apos;ll give you an example : a <unk> study on <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> , my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , with about a million <unk> <unk> in <unk> different <unk> .
What she found out of it , for every 10 solutions that are <unk> in more , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> two percent .
With 50 percent <unk> , there &apos;s 10 percent in less than <unk> than when they &apos;re only available to five . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> in which choice , is difficult to decide , and choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And <unk> , and again <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , and of course , <unk> never <unk> .
<unk> that doesn &apos;t mean only that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don &apos;t have enough money , to say that the decision is so <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , they &apos;re <unk> to five <unk> <unk> for year from <unk> <unk> <unk> , that would be <unk> to <unk> .
So <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> choices .
And I think I &apos;m going to <unk> the world .
&quot; And to end , for <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> ? &quot;
<unk> just to take the right decision , if it &apos;s for the <unk> , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and you &apos;ll get the wrong <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even though we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice , at the end we &apos;re less <unk> from the <unk> of how we had to <unk> .
And that for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of <unk> between which , if you <unk> one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy , to imagine that would have been better . And what &apos;s going on to be better . And what &apos;s happening is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> <unk> of choice , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the decision ,
even when it was a <unk> decision .
<unk> choices , there are more easy to <unk> of any <unk> that is <unk> of choice .
And also , there &apos;s what <unk> call .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well <unk> as the value that we give things to <unk> things from what we &apos;re going to <unk> things .
You know , when there are many <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s easy to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> that are choice .
So , this is an example . I &apos;m going to take with all the one who are not in New York .
But that &apos;s what it probably <unk> .
There &apos;s this <unk> to <unk> .
A <unk> place .
<unk> <unk> . It &apos;s all day . It &apos;s all for them .
Not <unk> . But what he thinks he thinks it &apos;s , &quot; Well , <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; All my <unk> <unk> are away . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> right in front of home . &quot;
And it <unk> two weeks from the idea that &apos;s <unk> -- the <unk> of <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the <unk> that we have from <unk> , more the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> them .
Here &apos;s another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It &apos;s about living the moment , and maybe maybe of the time .
But the most important point is that any thing you &apos;re going to be <unk> to do not to do other .
The things that don &apos;t have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk> .
It &apos;s almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were just one kind of , they were <unk> them and <unk> from <unk> , they were <unk> , only after <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of times , <unk> to go .
So , I started to <unk> a couple of when the <unk> were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> said , &quot; I want to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
<unk> it wants to <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> them wants to <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> -- &quot; <unk> to <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a little bit of a <unk> , &quot; I want the kind of -- that was the only kind of , &quot; he had no idea what was , for a <unk> , so I &apos;m going to be <unk> <unk> , and then <unk> from the <unk> , and then <unk> from the <unk> , <unk> , with the best couple of <unk> that I had ever .
It was the <unk> . With that choice I had <unk> the best .
But I &apos;m worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to <unk> .
The reason I was worse , I was <unk> with all that choice , my <unk> were <unk> ,
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn &apos;t <unk> to me when I was just a kind of , but when I was 100 , <unk> , at least one had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After I <unk> that I was <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in life of the people don &apos;t do that <unk> the <unk> that these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And this is <unk> less <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world &apos;s <unk> if it &apos;s going to be .
Because if I <unk> , I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
<unk> truth to this .
&quot; You know , when he was worse , &quot; The reason he was better when you were worse , it was even worse than <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are at the <unk> <unk> .
You &apos;ve never <unk> because your <unk> , because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; Yes , you want to do it . &quot;
I mean -- small <unk> moment -- that I &apos;m really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn &apos;t have done better , I &apos;m not <unk> .
But I &apos;m not always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> when there &apos;s only that kind of <unk> is that when you &apos;re not <unk> , and I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; Why ? &quot;
Who &apos;s <unk> ? &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> .
The world is the <unk> . What could do I do ?
When there are hundreds of <unk> , and you <unk> a <unk> , and you &apos;ll see who &apos;s the <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> ,
<unk> could do better .
With hundreds of <unk> , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people take decisions , even if the <unk> is <unk> , they <unk> and <unk> them to them .
In the last few years , the <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only one , but -- of this <unk> of <unk> is just that people have <unk> experiences because the standard are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation , they think that <unk> is their own .
So the final result is that in general , we &apos;re better , but we &apos;ll get worse .
I &apos;m going to tell you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all do for good and it &apos;s completely <unk> . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than not <unk> at all but from this doesn &apos;t have a lot of choice .
There &apos;s a <unk> value , <unk> . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve <unk> from a piece of the level that the choices that the choices that the <unk> our life .
Now , from the <unk> point -- I &apos;ve almost finished -- from the point of view , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What allows all of this choice in <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There are a lot of places in the world , and you &apos;ll get <unk> , where the problem is not <unk> choice .
The problem is that they &apos;re too <unk> .
So the <unk> I &apos;m talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> of money . It &apos;s a <unk> of money .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , is not just <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
They do something worse .
If a little bit of what in our <unk> , it was <unk> in those where people are too few <unk> , it &apos;s too few <unk> , it &apos;s not just the <unk> of them to <unk> , but also our .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income does well , not just to the poor -- not just to the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> us .
So , I said , &quot; <unk> , you can become everything you want to --
<unk> , people &apos;s <unk> , &quot; What <unk> that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s <unk> that you can &apos;t make anything in a glass <unk> . &quot;
&quot; A <unk> imagination , a <unk> <unk> of the world --
and I <unk> it , I <unk> it , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I realized that fish the fish knows that fish knows .
Because the reality of the fact of the fact that if you &apos;re <unk> in <unk> , so that &quot; everything is possible . &quot; You can &apos;t <unk> the freedom . You <unk> the <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> in a way that you can <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
Everybody needs a <unk> .
This is almost certainly <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
