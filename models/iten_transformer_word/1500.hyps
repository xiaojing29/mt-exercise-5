The year I &apos;ve been <unk> these <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , that <unk> <unk> , for three million years , and <unk> of the <unk> <unk> percent of the <unk> percent of the <unk> percent of the <unk> percent .
<unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> , because it &apos;s not the <unk> of the <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a sense , the <unk> of <unk> system .
You know , <unk> <unk> and you <unk> ,
The next <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
How you see , you see , you see the <unk> <unk> .
That &apos;s the <unk> in <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
You can see that the <unk> <unk> , five years , it &apos;s a <unk> , that you can see here , and here from the body .
In the <unk> years is the <unk> of this .
This is a problem because the <unk> is <unk> <unk> in the ocean where we <unk> are <unk> of <unk> where we are <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , that could <unk> , that could <unk> , <unk> this point .
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is already <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> , it &apos;s good . The question is , it &apos;s good .
A reason that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> never never <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> .
If you want to know how to know , you know , you know , it &apos;s where the <unk> , it &apos;s where the <unk> .
These are <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> other planet : <unk> , the most of the <unk> of the <unk> planet .
The month are the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> , that <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> .
<unk> , the third <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , you see , that a few years ago , and they were <unk> .
The <unk> percent of the world &apos;s <unk> of the world <unk> .
<unk> : this <unk> is the <unk> of the water <unk> of this <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> .
But when <unk> , the same <unk> water .
In the <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> percent of the percent .
<unk> <unk> are in the <unk> .
The <unk> , as you have <unk> , <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in the world <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the last <unk> in the last <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of all <unk> .
If you see the <unk> in the <unk> , you can see the <unk> ,
In the last five years we &apos;ve got a <unk> of <unk> <unk> every <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> in every day .
You see the area of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and they <unk> on the <unk> , there is a <unk> <unk> where there is a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
The most of the <unk> <unk> , that &apos;s <unk> , which is <unk> percent of 20 percent , is <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> is a problem , and the <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
The United States are one of two countries , and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
And you &apos;re <unk> to <unk> a lot of other <unk> .
But we &apos;re <unk> a <unk> of the <unk> .
These are the last <unk> in the last years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
In every way , there is a <unk> in our country .
The <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year for <unk> , which is a <unk> .
<unk> me me , something --
<unk> , in <unk> , where I was a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You see you &apos;ve seen it .
This is the second <unk> of <unk> in America .
It &apos;s happened in <unk> .
The <unk> of a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> is a kind of <unk> , and I &apos;m <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> here in America , and it &apos;s <unk> our <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> is <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
The most <unk> <unk> on the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is the <unk> . This is the <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> -- not what they &apos;re not going to be <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> : So , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> two <unk> .
This is a <unk> , a part of a part .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> , we see the <unk> <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> to our <unk> .
For this our <unk> is <unk> a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s actually , the <unk> <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it &apos;s <unk> -- it &apos;s also a good <unk> .
So , it &apos;s not <unk> of change .
I do it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you &apos;ve heard a lot of very much .
So , we <unk> a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! The <unk> are a little bit <unk> , but this is the <unk> of technology , but this is the <unk> of <unk> .
The <unk> of the <unk> is <unk> <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> technology <unk> <unk> that you see that you see that .
<unk> a <unk> : this is the <unk> technology <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> : The <unk> : The <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that <unk> all of all <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , as the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Now , there is a new new , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> America : <unk> percent of the <unk> percent of the <unk> .
A <unk> for <unk> America , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , a <unk> that we <unk> our problems .
It &apos;s <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> : This is the last last last last .
<unk> : <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> <unk> energy .
One of the most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , a new <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> for <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s a time .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> says , &quot; If you can go to <unk> , you go to <unk> , you go to <unk> , you go to <unk> , you go to <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
If you can go to the <unk> , you go back to the <unk> , you can see it . &quot;
We have to go to <unk> ,
Thank you very much .
The year I did a <unk> on the <unk> on the <unk> .
And <unk> of <unk> <unk> for <unk> .
So , it &apos;s <unk> . And that the other time , there were the most <unk> , the most <unk> <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> the <unk> that were <unk> that were <unk> in a <unk> of the universe -- and <unk> <unk> to <unk> million <unk> .
It &apos;s all the <unk> .
This is the machine <unk> .
<unk> these <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
This is what I work on the <unk> -- is called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> in <unk> , you can see the <unk> .
The <unk> of the <unk> we &apos;ve been <unk> the first time for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> .
It was that of <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
It &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> of the first <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with a <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
In other words , when I <unk> that the <unk> of 10 , <unk> that the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> that &apos;s a <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if you <unk> to <unk> , when you <unk> , you know , you know , and <unk> , and the <unk> that was this .
What we &apos;ve been a <unk> that we &apos;ve been a <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> a week , there was a week , there was a problem with these <unk> <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine is <unk> when the <unk> of <unk> .
Now , the <unk> of you <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> . &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And you can do it because when I &apos;m very <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , <unk> <unk> , to a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> that <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , these <unk> can <unk> .
In one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
This was the <unk> .
Now , this is still more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> , and you &apos;re <unk> <unk> , and you have to about <unk> about <unk> .
It &apos;s about <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , what we &apos;ve been <unk> , that we did .
We &apos;ve been <unk> and <unk> .
Now , they &apos;re <unk> all <unk> their <unk> .
<unk> the end of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , and we <unk> , and we <unk> to <unk> , and we can <unk> our <unk> <unk> to <unk> our <unk> <unk> to <unk> our <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Now , of course , of course , these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
I think that &apos;s that it &apos;s so much , the <unk> , I think , I think that the <unk> , I think that &apos;s the <unk> .
I want to <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and he said , &quot; <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
Thank you .
I want to <unk> <unk> when I <unk> children , <unk> , <unk> with <unk> .
And we <unk> as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and we think about <unk> , and we <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the world that <unk> in the world .
So , from <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I <unk> together , and my <unk> <unk> , and I <unk> , I started to <unk> , and I <unk> , and I <unk> , and I <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and <unk> our <unk> <unk> ?
The question was that that <unk> of the answer , the <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
You can see them with your <unk> , and you can <unk> them , &quot; <unk> , and they can <unk> their <unk> , and a <unk> a <unk> .
But <unk> , they are <unk> , as the <unk> , you can <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> are the example of a new <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And <unk> , they <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and we can <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> with some different example .
This is <unk> <unk> for a <unk> , if you <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> in a <unk> , if you <unk> , if you <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you &apos;re <unk> , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s <unk> them .
If they &apos;re <unk> , you can <unk> , and you can see a little bit .
If they &apos;re <unk> , you can <unk> , and you can see a little bit .
<unk> , also <unk> their <unk> .
There is <unk> that one of the interesting of the <unk> that we can <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> a <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , and a <unk> <unk> .
In this case , we <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> , where you <unk> <unk> .
and I can <unk> for <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , where you &apos;re <unk> .
If you can <unk> , we can <unk> a little bit .
I &apos;m also <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> , as <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , they can <unk> things , and <unk> <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m going to --
This is a <unk> of <unk> that I do with a <unk> <unk> .
Here we have a <unk> of the <unk> that is <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , to every <unk> <unk> a <unk> in every <unk> , <unk> , <unk> every <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Then , after <unk> , you know , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> <unk> and new <unk> .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s here , the children in <unk> <unk> <unk> , I &apos;ve been <unk> in <unk> that <unk> <unk> and I <unk> a <unk> .
They &apos;re in their <unk> .
And one of the things that this is that <unk> is that <unk> , you can &apos;t have to <unk> a lot of <unk> .
<unk> only , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , and they &apos;re going to do , and they do .
Here &apos;s there here that &apos;s <unk> .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> .
It &apos;s just just <unk> .
They were only <unk> , for he was just <unk> .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> . He &apos;s <unk> .
It can <unk> new <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> their <unk> .
This is , it &apos;s doing the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
<unk> : Now , he has a <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> !
So , <unk> <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> -- you know , you know .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with the <unk> , and it can see it as you <unk> .
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with the <unk> , and it can see it as you <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I &apos;ve got the last time , and I &apos;m going to show you to <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s one , it &apos;s a <unk> , for <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> here is <unk> <unk> as <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of these <unk> has four <unk> , and you can use it .
You can see this <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s just <unk> a <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; and a <unk> . &quot;
These are that you can see from the <unk> , like <unk> and the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , a <unk> .
And then there are the <unk> , that <unk> , and <unk> , that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> as it &apos;s like this .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> in the <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> <unk> in a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Now , <unk> a <unk> .
<unk> : Now , <unk> <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> : And now , I <unk> the <unk> , I can <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , I can <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> : I can <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> the whole time , and <unk> the other <unk> of the other <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : And now <unk> the <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : I can <unk> the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to <unk> , but I can <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And now , I can <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> <unk> the left <unk> <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you see , my new <unk> is new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and my brain <unk> <unk> , and my brain .
And today , I had time to show you one of this <unk> , and some of the <unk> that we have to <unk> from the <unk> .
The <unk> that &apos;s that &apos;s <unk> is that <unk> this new <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , that we <unk> , that we can <unk> in our world .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m not the now , I &apos;m going to talk to you all of you .
I &apos;m a <unk> .
<unk> , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of this .
It &apos;s also the <unk> of life and the <unk> of life .
And it &apos;s not going to change .
But , this , this is <unk> in my life , and in my life and in my life , that he was <unk> to <unk> .
The one thing is that I &apos;ve got this book , this <unk> <unk> called &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And the <unk> is that <unk> , people who <unk> me as if I was <unk> , I <unk> , I <unk> , I <unk> , people in the <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
<unk> me to me , and I &apos;m not going to be <unk> , &quot; You know , you know , you know , I &apos;m not going to do it ?
You can &apos;t <unk> to <unk> all of life , and it can be able to be able to be able to make a book that can <unk> ? &quot;
What do you can <unk> you ? &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> , you know .
But it could go to the <unk> , I <unk> that I can see it , when I <unk> to say , I was a <unk> -- I was a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And people said , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> &apos;t know , I don &apos;t have to be <unk> ?
You don &apos;t have to <unk> <unk> you ?
You can &apos;t <unk> this <unk> for all of life , and it &apos;s not about it . And on a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
<unk> , you know , you know .
The answer -- the answer is the answer to all these <unk> , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
You know , I &apos;ve been <unk> all of all those things .
I &apos;ve been always <unk> .
And I also have to be a lot of other things that people can &apos;t <unk> .
As the <unk> , and other things things .
But , for what &apos;s going to tell you what I was <unk> , because I <unk> <unk> is because of it ?
Is it <unk> ?
It &apos;s <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> to do .
But there is that in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
How do my father , he was a <unk> <unk> and <unk> not to the <unk> of a <unk> in the <unk> years of the <unk> , and then you could be <unk> to be <unk> ?
<unk> , it was never -- that <unk> of <unk> , like <unk> , like ?
You know , it &apos;s not that ?
<unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , in <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve got this <unk> , we don &apos;t only <unk> , and not only <unk> <unk> , this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it doesn &apos;t look at the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> , only in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> .
And also , also have the <unk> that they &apos;re really <unk> <unk> them .
<unk> , first , first <unk> , in the last <unk> said , &quot; <unk> me , &quot; <unk> me a little <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of life .
But we don &apos;t <unk> when we &apos;ve been <unk> when we &apos;ve been doing these things that we &apos;ve got to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> .
And the question that &apos;s going to <unk> all here is , you see here is , you &apos;re <unk> with this idea ?
I &apos;m going to be this -- because it &apos;s <unk> a <unk> of <unk> , and it &apos;s not <unk> this <unk> .
I think it &apos;s <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s also <unk> and I don &apos;t want to <unk> in the next <unk> in the next <unk> .
I think it &apos;s better <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
And I know , I know , in my case -- in my <unk> , it was very <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in my <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , I &apos;m really <unk> , I &apos;ve got to 10 years .
I &apos;ve got four <unk> four <unk> .
And it &apos;s very <unk> that you know , it &apos;s now in the world as <unk> , as I <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , my <unk> .
<unk> , because we are all the most <unk> , and they are <unk> that my <unk> , and I <unk> my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , that &apos;s <unk> !
You know , it &apos;s the <unk> that &apos;s <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> , and I don &apos;t do it .
I can do this work .
So , the question , how do ?
And so I &apos;m going to be a lot of <unk> , that we can <unk> to be <unk> to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and that <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> ,
I have to have some <unk> a <unk> of <unk> , which I &apos;m <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> year , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> to be able to be able to be able to be able to be <unk> to be <unk> to be <unk> to <unk> to <unk> to <unk> to <unk> , to <unk> , and <unk> to <unk> to <unk> <unk> to be <unk> ,
<unk> <unk> people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> me , he <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> because it <unk> in <unk> and then <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people not <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , OK ?
You know , <unk> that was that the <unk> <unk> and that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> were <unk> , but <unk> , <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> , because the <unk> <unk> <unk> that a <unk> , that a <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> that <unk> , that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , that &apos;s the <unk> , which is the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and your <unk> <unk> .
And all of <unk> that was so that <unk> , right ?
So the <unk> were <unk> <unk> , like things , like <unk> , as <unk> , no <unk> , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , as well ,
If your work was not <unk> <unk> , all the <unk> , all <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If your <unk> , it was not all the <unk> , right ?
<unk> <unk> that was the <unk> of <unk> that was a <unk> .
And so people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Then the <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> this is <unk> , we <unk> this idea , we have the <unk> of the universe , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and people who <unk> to think that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And for the first time , you have to <unk> this <unk> , you know , you know , and <unk> a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I think I think it was a <unk> .
I think that <unk> to be a simple person , a <unk> of how to be a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and the <unk> of all <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s like to be <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s all these <unk> <unk> on <unk> .
And I think it was this <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , and I think about <unk> years .
And if this is , and I think that &apos;s , and I think it &apos;s , the question , and now , now , and now ?
How do we can do it ?
<unk> to <unk> a <unk> of the <unk> of human <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe no , no .
You can &apos;t <unk> to the <unk> years of <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And there is a little people who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s not going to be that .
But the question that &apos;s <unk> is -- because it &apos;s not ?
Why don &apos;t <unk> that this way ?
Because it has been more than the other thing that has been for the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> that , as you &apos;ve never <unk> to do something -- so , so , all of here -- it &apos;s not <unk> .
And , in fact , can <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ve been <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which has been now , but it was a <unk> for the <unk> , but it was a <unk> and said , he said , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> , when you know , <unk> , <unk> , when they <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , when you know , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I said , he was a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , because it was <unk> , because the <unk> <unk> his <unk> .
I have to have a <unk> thing to do that point of his <unk> , and it was a <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And so <unk> , he was <unk> to this <unk> , and it &apos;s not to <unk> that you can &apos;t have to <unk> a <unk> and a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> not <unk> to be enough , so <unk> , so <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> . They <unk> to <unk> the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and he said , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And then there were those <unk> -- this is not <unk> -- there were not there -- there was the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ?
So , was <unk> , it was <unk> to <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , and then he said , then he said , and he said , and then he was <unk> the other <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in his body and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the <unk> .
And in these <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , but <unk> on the <unk> , but the last <unk> , the last last time .
So when you <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> to my <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You don &apos;t know my <unk> <unk> -- not a <unk> !
I &apos;m a <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> every day and <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
But I also , in my <unk> , I <unk> , I <unk> that , and what they &apos;re <unk> .
And that also <unk> that also <unk> the <unk> .
You know , also , you know , and the ideas , I <unk> <unk> , I can &apos;t <unk> <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And as we can <unk> to <unk> , but it &apos;s not <unk> the <unk> , but it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> , that &apos;s <unk> <unk> ?
For me how I &apos;ve been <unk> that I &apos;ve been the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , which I <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of this , and you know , for the <unk> of life is the <unk> of life , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , you know , and a day , and a day , and a day , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and he <unk> , and a day .
<unk> , and all of the <unk> <unk> , that <unk> <unk> <unk> , that &apos;s <unk> in his head as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> , and the <unk> , <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> .
It &apos;s not a <unk> of <unk> , not a <unk> , not a <unk> .
So , it &apos;s going to see this <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , &quot; <unk> , and <unk> <unk> . &quot; <unk> <unk> this <unk> .
It &apos;s not enough to <unk> and I can &apos;t <unk> . &quot;
And you go into the <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> .
<unk> the whole <unk> <unk> and it &apos;s something like a new <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and he said , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , you see that ? &quot;
&quot; What is it to be a <unk> now ?
If you want to <unk> , <unk> , you know when I can <unk> <unk> , you can <unk> to you .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And his <unk> <unk> <unk> after this <unk> <unk> .
I don &apos;t have the work , it was <unk> .
But the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> that was <unk> when <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where it was <unk> to be <unk> to be <unk> , and it was not to be a <unk> .
but <unk> this <unk> , <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> and this <unk> , that <unk> <unk> , and that was not <unk> .
So , as we &apos;re going to change a little bit of it in a way that <unk> , and I &apos;ve been <unk> a <unk> .
This idea , I was <unk> when I was <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , and <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> that we &apos;re going to be able to be able to <unk> , and you can &apos;t <unk> the <unk> that you can &apos;t be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be <unk> to be
It &apos;s not only <unk> , just <unk> the <unk> .
And I think about this project that project .
But then I <unk> that <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , I <unk> my <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> my <unk> <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk> in the room .
And I said , &quot; <unk> , what , we know , that if this book , we know , it &apos;s not going to be <unk> , not my <unk> , not my book , not <unk> , not my book , not , and what , it &apos;s not <unk> .
Because you see , there &apos;s all the <unk> that I &apos;ve never , and I don &apos;t have more .
So if you have to do , you have to do your part of your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t know , it &apos;s not me .
I <unk> in my same is my work .
And I want to tell you that I &apos;ve been <unk> to do my <unk> , &quot; Why I &apos;m going to do my <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> in Africa , and it &apos;s <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk> .
But every <unk> , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I know , I know what I know , I know , I know , I know , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> .
It was like if you <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it was not doing not <unk> , as the <unk> <unk> , as the <unk> , but it was all the <unk> .
And at the <unk> not just as a human human human human human human human .
But you <unk> from <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
And when this <unk> , people who was the <unk> , people who was <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
<unk> , <unk> , when <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , you can <unk> in the <unk> .
In <unk> , when a <unk> , he was something something about it and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
And it &apos;s <unk> because we need .
But , the problem is the problem , for the same day , when you <unk> , when you &apos;re <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s just a <unk> with <unk> <unk> , and maybe maybe it &apos;s not <unk> more <unk> .
And maybe no one of the <unk> <unk> , and what do is to do it to do it , and what do it &apos;s going to do it ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But maybe it &apos;s not going to be so <unk> if you <unk> , <unk> , that <unk> , <unk> , that <unk> <unk> , that &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
But I &apos;m going to <unk> that you &apos;re in a <unk> of this <unk> of <unk> in your life , you have to <unk> when you get to <unk> when you <unk> when you <unk> you .
And , you know , if the way we think that it &apos;s all of it .
And so I started to <unk> , and it &apos;s like the <unk> , and it &apos;s like <unk> to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that I have to <unk> when I <unk> me , it &apos;s not <unk> .
It &apos;s not just <unk> only your <unk> .
<unk> <unk> to your <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , for a <unk> , for a moment , then you know , then you know , then <unk> ! &quot;
<unk> , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s <unk> .
And &quot; <unk> ! &quot; <unk> .
I think there is <unk> <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; <unk> you know , also , it &apos;s only for the human <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> : <unk> !
As I &apos;ve already know , I &apos;ve been <unk> of these <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
Now , we &apos;ve been <unk> a new <unk> , we started to <unk> the <unk> and now , we &apos;re going to <unk> a new <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
We have to make <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
&quot; <unk> is the life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many <unk> <unk> , to understand <unk> <unk> .
We have different <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> from 20 years .
When we <unk> the human human human <unk> , we <unk> from the <unk> of the world of the world .
Now , we can <unk> the <unk> , or we create this <unk> of life , or new <unk> of this <unk> <unk> of the universe ?
This is the <unk> of a little <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , which is the <unk> of the most <unk> that can <unk> in the <unk> .
And we have to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> one of the <unk> ,
We &apos;re able to <unk> a <unk> of the <unk> that are here .
But when we see a <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> to our <unk> .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we see all the <unk> that we can <unk> , one time , it &apos;s very <unk> that can see a <unk> <unk> .
So , that the only <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> some of these <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> of these <unk> .
And so we started the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , we can <unk> a <unk> ? &quot;
You can see the <unk> of these <unk> that we &apos;ve never been able to create before now , now we &apos;ve never been able to create the <unk> .
And , in the case , we can <unk> a <unk> ?
A <unk> <unk> is just a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that we &apos;re able to <unk> the life is <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , as a <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> .
And our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve got more years ago .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But we &apos;ve been that <unk> of the <unk> is very hard .
There are <unk> of thousands of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we have to have a new <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , in our first <unk> , to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a little <unk> that <unk> .
We have the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
The interesting is when we &apos;ve got this <unk> of <unk> <unk> and we &apos;ve <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , and we &apos;ve <unk> to this <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> are <unk> <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> <unk> , <unk> , they were <unk> and they <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ve got to <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk> that they have <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> ,
They &apos;re <unk> more than you .
<unk> that &apos;s a very <unk> that the <unk> can build the same <unk> <unk> in a <unk> system .
But I <unk> things in the things that &apos;s <unk> .
<unk> <unk> the whole <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m more <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we &apos;ve been <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> , so that we can change the <unk> for that are the <unk> of a <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> , and if we <unk> with a computer , these <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and if these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
When I <unk> this for the first time in <unk> <unk> <unk> , it was a <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> .
We &apos;ve been <unk> , <unk> , and then <unk> , if it was <unk> that <unk> <unk> never <unk> .
A part of the <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that you have to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> here .
You have to <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : We have a <unk> <unk> on four <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> <unk> together , and there is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we can use the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
What we &apos;ve been <unk> in the beginning was <unk> .
There was no <unk> from the <unk> that was not <unk> .
We &apos;ve been <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and them them <unk> them .
And we started to <unk> <unk> , <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , we have to <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re <unk> to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> . You see a <unk> .
We &apos;re trying to <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
So , this is <unk> <unk> a <unk> of <unk> .
When I <unk> these <unk> <unk> , more <unk> , <unk> <unk> , not <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
So we <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a example .
This is <unk> , <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> , and you can see it .
In the <unk> -- it was just like this was <unk> .
<unk> thousands of these things that are able to do it .
These are <unk> that they can <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m not really , that the life <unk> in space , and you see <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> , the <unk> that is that this is <unk> .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we &apos;ve been <unk> these <unk> , just <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are that <unk> a <unk> of <unk> ,
This is the <unk> that we &apos;ve been <unk> a little time .
I &apos;m more <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s the <unk> <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s the <unk> of the man .
He &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you &apos;re <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , we <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Now , how do we do this as we can <unk> ?
<unk> , of course , a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a little more <unk> when you get the <unk> when you see it .
It &apos;s more simple when you &apos;re <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> as our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and a <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> of <unk> .
In <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> , but we &apos;ve <unk> in the <unk> , and we &apos;re able to do a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We have a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The two are different as <unk> <unk> .
We have some <unk> some <unk> in this way to <unk> that we can <unk> this <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> all of all <unk> ,
And when the <unk> , we &apos;ve been <unk> in the new <unk> , our <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> is <unk> in the new <unk> .
And <unk> <unk> that doesn &apos;t go to <unk> , but we &apos;ve got to <unk> more <unk> .
This is one of the <unk> of our <unk> .
We &apos;ve been that <unk> <unk> , <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a <unk> of new <unk> in a new <unk> of new <unk> .
So , that it &apos;s going to be able to be <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the <unk> that was not <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> that we &apos;ve <unk> <unk> that .
It &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and we <unk> with <unk> , and we <unk> , and the new <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> that we have <unk> .
And in a <unk> <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> in a new <unk> , <unk> , <unk> on the new <unk> , <unk> that we &apos;ve <unk> in the <unk> .
All <unk> are <unk> , <unk> , <unk> are <unk> , and when <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and when we <unk> <unk> .
Now , this could <unk> <unk> , but <unk> the <unk> <unk> , but <unk> the things that we can change the things in <unk> .
Now , I &apos;ve already <unk> that you &apos;re already <unk> , but I &apos;m not going to three million years and a half of the <unk> , and I &apos;ve already said , and I &apos;ve been <unk> to <unk> a new <unk> of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of this <unk> <unk> .
Why do what do ?
I think it &apos;s enough to <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We &apos;re going to <unk> you &apos;re a half and a half of people in the next three years .
A <unk> example , I &apos;ve been <unk> in <unk> .
Now , there are three people on <unk> in <unk> , in <unk> , there &apos;s four years .
We &apos;re <unk> problems now , <unk> water and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> , and a half of people .
<unk> <unk> , it &apos;s more than the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What is that it &apos;s about <unk> million <unk> .
When we have to <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , it &apos;s a new <unk> , it &apos;s a new <unk> .
In the most <unk> of all the <unk> of all of the <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> ,
In the day , I &apos;m going to be <unk> in the world , we have a <unk> <unk> of 20 million <unk> , and I like to think that are the future .
The <unk> <unk> only a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and think about how much of this things are <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> here . The <unk> is <unk> and our <unk> <unk> .
Now , we &apos;ve got to <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and we &apos;re going to create <unk> .
We &apos;re able to build a very <unk> that can make a million <unk> .
<unk> of these <unk> <unk> 20 million <unk> , and we can <unk> the <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> , we can change , we can change a little <unk> , we can change a little <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> years .
And it &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> .
We can <unk> for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some <unk> that we &apos;re working on to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a computer .
Well , we know , we know .
We know , that &apos;s the <unk> of their <unk> .
Now , we &apos;re going to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You &apos;ve seen you seen that <unk> from the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> .
We &apos;ve got <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But the only way that the only <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> to <unk> that we can <unk> , and the <unk> to <unk> to <unk> , we can <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> with the <unk> , and we have a <unk> in our world , we &apos;ve <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we &apos;ve <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> in the ocean , in the ocean , <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> of energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can <unk> the <unk> , that can be <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So , we can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be what it is the <unk> , we <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , we <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
You can &apos;t do it , where you can &apos;t do it ?
It &apos;s a <unk> of the <unk> of the energy of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> , we &apos;re working for <unk> , we &apos;re working for <unk> .
You &apos;ve seen this year with the <unk> , we are always <unk> a year and with a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> the right .
I think that you can change <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is like the future could be able to <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> so much as the people .
Our <unk> is to do it &apos;s going to be very much . Thank you very much . Thank you very much . Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
<unk> of all of all I &apos;m going to see , I can see the new technology , we &apos;ve been <unk> to <unk> a year .
It &apos;s about a <unk> that you can <unk> <unk> that you can <unk> with a <unk> of <unk> with a <unk> of <unk> .
Here we &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> with a <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s not how much is the <unk> of information that we see , and that are the <unk> of the <unk> .
Most of the most of the <unk> , but this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s not a difference because the only thing that <unk> <unk> <unk> , this is the number of <unk> . It &apos;s a very <unk> . It &apos;s a very <unk> . It &apos;s a very <unk> .
This is a book , example , in example , <unk> ,
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> a <unk> .
For <unk> that is that it &apos;s not just a <unk> , we can do a <unk> , and we see a <unk> of <unk> , and you see a <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> of a <unk> .
It &apos;s a way to be a little bit <unk> for a <unk> .
I &apos;m not going to <unk> .
This is a example , it &apos;s a number of <unk> .
Every big is the <unk> of a <unk> .
And you know , it &apos;s the <unk> of <unk> , and the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> for a <unk> .
We have something that with the <unk> of this <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> .
We have a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> very much more than that you have a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
If you see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here here .
Or other <unk> , or <unk> <unk> .
And this <unk> , some of these ideas for <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> that <unk> <unk> and other <unk> other <unk> , not <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Now , of course , the <unk> is a <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this time , if you don &apos;t know , if we don &apos;t know , we &apos;ve been <unk> in this .
These are all the <unk> in the United States <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So now , now I <unk> something else .
This is now in the <unk> , you can see it .
It &apos;s about a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> and other is a <unk> <unk> to <unk> the computer <unk> <unk> , one of the <unk> , one of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
You can <unk> when this kind of <unk> , we can <unk> to a <unk> of the other <unk> , and this kind of <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> <unk> here .
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and they have these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m going to show you some other environment .
There are some <unk> some more <unk> .
I want to <unk> one of the <unk> <unk> , and this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that we &apos;ve been <unk> for the first time for the <unk> , and this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . And this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve been <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , and you &apos;ve got to <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , they &apos;re all <unk> <unk> and they &apos;re all <unk> <unk> in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to <unk> this way .
You know , I never never <unk> to work .
It &apos;s very <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think that you see that it &apos;s a lot of different <unk> of different <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , <unk> of different <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> of <unk> of different <unk> of different <unk> of different <unk> of <unk> of different <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
And if you can see , <unk> those <unk> .
So , you &apos;re very <unk> .
I &apos;m going to be in the <unk> of the <unk> --
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can <unk> from the <unk> of this environment .
The point is that we can do with the <unk> things that is now <unk> . This is now <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and all these <unk> <unk> .
All of those <unk> <unk> together , the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
You can have a <unk> of the whole whole <unk> that <unk> .
I think about this as <unk> of <unk> <unk> on Earth .
It &apos;s something that <unk> in <unk> , and the people who <unk> , and the <unk> that we <unk> to <unk> , and the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> are <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you have the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> <unk> , my <unk> , my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I can <unk> , and I can <unk> , and I can <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , and I can <unk> to <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And of course , a <unk> of all that are <unk> <unk> of every part of the <unk> , <unk> not just <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
Chris Anderson : How do it &apos;s good ? What do you see what your <unk> <unk> is that <unk> , in the next time , in the next time , all of the next <unk> in the world .
<unk> : <unk> . That &apos;s what is doing is doing .
It &apos;s <unk> , if you want to <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> .
And it &apos;s doing the <unk> of the <unk> .
The interesting thing is really interesting if you have to <unk> that a lot of these <unk> <unk> .
As you have a <unk> <unk> , you have a <unk> , you <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
Now , what &apos;s going to <unk> all the <unk> of your <unk> ?
So the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> that <unk> is really <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> . It &apos;s really <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> . It &apos;s really <unk> <unk> .
CA : <unk> , it &apos;s really <unk> .
<unk> : I &apos;m very <unk> .
One of the <unk> when you <unk> and a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> , and one of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I think that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , but it &apos;s not only <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , but <unk> , but <unk> ,
<unk> a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> that our <unk> <unk> that our <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And , of course , all of the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We have to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , so we don &apos;t have <unk> , and <unk> --
We all have a <unk> .
What <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> every <unk> of every <unk> of every <unk> .
It &apos;s not the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
He was my <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> in a month , or a <unk> <unk> of <unk> in <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the world .
All of these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of <unk> , <unk> of <unk> , <unk> of <unk> in the world .
And if you <unk> a <unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> that can see .
<unk> , the <unk> of the world <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> <unk> the planet , and it &apos;s the important <unk> , and it &apos;s the <unk> <unk> .
And you can think that <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
It &apos;s the <unk> of what we are in the <unk> that we can be in how much <unk> , <unk> .
And <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> very much more <unk> .
<unk> , for example , <unk> that <unk> percent of all the <unk> of all of all the <unk> , because it &apos;s <unk> <unk> , because it &apos;s <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> <unk> in the <unk> -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of all that is , of course , <unk> <unk> .
When you &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> is not only <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> is the human human human human human human human human .
It &apos;s the <unk> with the <unk> that <unk> of every <unk> in the world .
Every <unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , and we are <unk> in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
These are not more <unk> children , the <unk> , that it &apos;s not <unk> , which is already already , that they are already .
What is there &apos;s more <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , to be the last <unk> , not a <unk> , not not not not <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> was the <unk> of every weeks of every weeks , every weeks , every weeks , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I know that one of you you know , it &apos;s not so much .
The world &apos;s not a place if we <unk> the same <unk> , then we <unk> , then we &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> a <unk> thing that it &apos;s not going to talk about the <unk> .
I would like to do a <unk> ,
I have a little <unk> in <unk> for what we &apos;re <unk> to what we &apos;re <unk> .
And of us , we know that when I &apos;m different <unk> of <unk> , and I really really really <unk> .
<unk> for example , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s <unk> <unk> , because the <unk> <unk> , because the <unk> <unk> is in the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
They have a <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> a <unk> that a different <unk> .
All the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , the <unk> is that in these <unk> <unk> , you &apos;re going to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
You can <unk> to talk and then <unk> .
<unk> one of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that has been <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They have been <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They have <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> , they have to <unk> a <unk> <unk> , and not <unk> , not <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> not only <unk> .
You &apos;re <unk> between their <unk> .
The percent of the <unk> <unk> was <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> , we &apos;ve been two <unk> of <unk> and when we <unk> to know , they <unk> , they have a <unk> that was so <unk> , and then they <unk> <unk> , and then <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> were able to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> years , I was a very interesting <unk> , and it was really interesting when I <unk> my <unk> <unk> <unk> me , I wanted to <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
For a sense of <unk> , I had to <unk> the <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> is not <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> of <unk> world .
<unk> interesting .
If you &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> of the world , what do ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> <unk> , that the <unk> , that the <unk> not <unk> <unk> . And the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> , and the other <unk> <unk> <unk> . And the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What it &apos;s interesting <unk> is the <unk> of life and life .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> can be <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
For this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , you go to my God .
We <unk> in <unk> <unk> and God . &quot;
And from the moment that you &apos;re <unk> , it &apos;s the <unk> that you can see the <unk> ?
So , you know , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the body , <unk> <unk> in a <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> of <unk> , this <unk> is not never been <unk> <unk> .
In <unk> today are <unk> from a <unk> , but their <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> in a world , and they were <unk> in a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> years , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> , I &apos;m <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
For all of this time , they are <unk> <unk> their <unk> , <unk> that they <unk> their <unk> and only <unk> their <unk> <unk> -- and only <unk> their <unk> -- for the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , the <unk> <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> <unk> , and for the first time , and for them , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ? &quot; <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> . Now , it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
You know , it &apos;s <unk> that we <unk> , we are the <unk> of the <unk> of the world .
This is very important to <unk> is very important .
When we think about <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> , that <unk> <unk> <unk> , that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> in his <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> that are <unk> more <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> are not <unk> <unk> .
There &apos;s no space for these things in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , but <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , but <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , because the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What does it ?
<unk> that <unk> that <unk> that <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and a different <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk> .
That &apos;s the <unk> of one or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What is the interesting is the <unk> that <unk> <unk> the <unk> , and the <unk> world .
I &apos;m going to be in the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> .
What it &apos;s a human different <unk> of the <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you &apos;re <unk> that these <unk> <unk> , we can create a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ve been <unk> this picture in the <unk> <unk> .
You know , you know , the most of you have to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What it &apos;s the <unk> <unk> is not the <unk> of the <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> two <unk> .
<unk> , this <unk> , that <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> with a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> , very <unk> , very <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like <unk> , and a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> a <unk> of the <unk> . It &apos;s not a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the man who has <unk> the <unk> , with his <unk> , with his <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> my <unk> , you can &apos;t <unk> these <unk> , because you &apos;re not going to be <unk> , and you can &apos;t be <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , because you can &apos;t be <unk> <unk> <unk> , because you can &apos;t be a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s possible <unk> only if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Now , the <unk> that <unk> <unk> that are <unk> in this <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , but <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
We have the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , that can <unk> <unk> .
But if you <unk> , we <unk> , we <unk> , we have <unk> <unk> . &quot;
What does it ?
This is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , and that we <unk> in the same <unk> .
If you &apos;re <unk> as <unk> their <unk> , you know , you know , the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest , &quot; No . &quot; No . &quot;
The <unk> is : <unk> <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
<unk> , but it &apos;s not very much more than <unk> , but it &apos;s very interesting <unk> .
Now , <unk> <unk> , <unk> is that also <unk> , that also have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In fact , in the <unk> <unk> , not <unk> <unk> for his <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , but it was the <unk> <unk> , but it was the <unk> <unk> and we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . We <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
All of the <unk> <unk> are <unk> in a new <unk> for new <unk> , new life .
And the problem is not the technology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they have <unk> when they have <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> as <unk> as <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s not the change or the technology that <unk> <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s the power of the power . It &apos;s not the power . It &apos;s not the power . It &apos;s not the power of the power . It &apos;s not the power of the power of the power .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And if you <unk> a <unk> of the world , <unk> that these are not <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m <unk> <unk> and <unk> out of the <unk> , <unk> that they <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that you &apos;re <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
<unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that has <unk> in the <unk> , and now , and now now now , and now now , and now now now , and now <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> where you can see where it can see where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Or in the case of the <unk> , are the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> ,
If you <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I &apos;m doing a lot of <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
As <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , is <unk> <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , but the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , but it &apos;s not only <unk> in the <unk> , because of the <unk> <unk> .
And you can &apos;t understand the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
I have <unk> <unk> <unk> in China , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> , but only <unk> <unk> , only <unk> , but only <unk> , and it &apos;s going to <unk> that there are the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The father of this was <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that &apos;s been <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> .
mother was <unk> , and his <unk> was <unk> .
It was been <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> of two years , and two years , because it <unk> <unk> , and he didn &apos;t have to <unk> .
The <unk> , that has been <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
A day <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and , and for this <unk> , was <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> years .
The <unk> can be <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And in the end , all of it , all of it .
<unk> in the world <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the world ?
The <unk> <unk> <unk> , first <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of our <unk> , in our <unk> <unk> <unk> , and our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , but a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s <unk> that our <unk> <unk> , is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , that has <unk> , that <unk> , that has <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> world <unk> <unk> .
That &apos;s <unk> , that we &apos;ve got the <unk> of all the <unk> that we &apos;ve been <unk> in <unk> .
When I think of these <unk> <unk> of the world is <unk> to be <unk> , we &apos;re going to be <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s in these <unk> that we all <unk> the <unk> of what we &apos;re a <unk> , that we have to be able to be <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> . And all the <unk> <unk> , we &apos;ve been <unk> .
I &apos;ve been this picture of the <unk> of the <unk> , when I was <unk> to <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> , and this , this <unk> <unk> , and this , this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> , and in the <unk> years , we &apos;ve <unk> <unk> <unk> , we <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man , <unk> <unk> .
The family , <unk> for his life , <unk> , <unk> all the <unk> , and all the <unk> , and all the <unk> <unk> .
I know that the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man , not <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , you know , it &apos;s <unk> the <unk> in <unk> and <unk> in your <unk> . When I <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> on this <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
He <unk> the <unk> , with a <unk> , with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> with <unk> ? <unk> <unk> . And this , in different <unk> , in different <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> together .
It &apos;s the new <unk> . It &apos;s called <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . <unk> all the <unk> <unk> .
One of example , as a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And , for the <unk> , I think it &apos;s really <unk> to <unk> , that <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> that <unk> , <unk> <unk> that are <unk> .
For one is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of the human <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> . And for us , the <unk> of these children , <unk> , as our <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> of our <unk> <unk> .
So , we &apos;re going to <unk> , we are <unk> that the <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s not <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> --
<unk> <unk> , but we &apos;re not <unk> , but that the stories of the world , and maybe we can change the best <unk> , and maybe the <unk> of our <unk> <unk> <unk> million <unk> million <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
<unk> our <unk> are <unk> of people .
Our <unk> is <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> world , and <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . You can <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I hope that I hope you &apos;ve got to <unk> other <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the case , in the case , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I want to do with what I <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
<unk> <unk> <unk> ?
The <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
The reason is , from one , in the <unk> that the <unk> is in the same <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , it is <unk> .
<unk> other is in the fact that if we are <unk> , we &apos;re going to be able to do it for all of our <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> that we &apos;re going to be <unk> in our <unk> .
The way to <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> .
<unk> people have more <unk> , and it &apos;s the most <unk> , and it &apos;s the most of their <unk> , it &apos;s the <unk> .
This , <unk> , it &apos;s so <unk> in the <unk> that one is that there is <unk> in <unk> .
And it &apos;s also <unk> in our <unk> .
I &apos;m going to show you some of what it has to be able to see it .
This is my <unk> . It &apos;s not very much .
I <unk> a simple <unk> , and I <unk> <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that you can <unk> to <unk> a <unk> of <unk> that you can see a <unk> of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
That &apos;s the <unk> .
And then you see to <unk> one of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> , there is a <unk> number of <unk> <unk> .
We can make a half of different <unk> , and a half of different <unk> that there are a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> the world &apos;s <unk> .
A time , when I was a child , you can get all the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You know , <unk> , it &apos;s not <unk> .
A <unk> of what , it was the other , it was the <unk> <unk> you never <unk> .
These are <unk> .
Now we have a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
This is the future of the future .
My <unk> is what in the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you have to <unk> , you &apos;ve seen in the <unk> , you have seen <unk> <unk> .
And what &apos;s the end of the end that people <unk> in the <unk> and that the question is the answer is the answer of the answer is , &quot; No , &quot; No , &quot; No , &quot; No .
It &apos;s not possible to be a <unk> that it &apos;s not <unk> things .
So , in other life that are very much more important than the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> &apos;t do in the United States , you &apos;re <unk> and the <unk> <unk> you have to do .
<unk> , <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> , we can do , we can do , or &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> and these <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
You see the <unk> , what do do do you do ? &quot;
And the <unk> says , &quot; <unk> , he <unk> these <unk> , and these <unk> <unk> , and <unk> these <unk> <unk> . &quot;
What do you do ? &quot;
And you &apos;re <unk> , &quot; <unk> if she was , what do ? &quot;
And the <unk> , &quot; But I &apos;m not just . &quot;
The <unk> is called &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> that <unk> is a <unk> .
But it &apos;s not that one <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> that you know , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
There &apos;s a <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you know , you know , you know , that you can &apos;t <unk> .
But if we can &apos;t <unk> , because it &apos;s <unk> them ?
The answer is that we want to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of that that &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> of the <unk> , as you see in this <unk> , and you want to <unk> the <unk> <unk> . &quot; You can &apos;t want to <unk> the <unk> . &quot; We have to <unk> to <unk> . We have to <unk> .
And we can <unk> how it can <unk> .
The <unk> that is that every <unk> , you have to <unk> , you have to be a person .
<unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , a time , a time , <unk> , <unk> , it was <unk> , it was <unk> , it was <unk> , and you can <unk> the <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> .
The only one was with the <unk> , when you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s not going to do , after that .
<unk> , all of it is really <unk> .
<unk> <unk> students , and they &apos;re very much percent of the <unk> percent of <unk> , a <unk> time .
And because they don &apos;t have <unk> , because it &apos;s not <unk> .
but because I &apos;m <unk> , <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s not going to do it ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ? I &apos;ve been to think about the children ? &quot;
I &apos;m <unk> <unk> .
And so , you know , even if you know , it &apos;s not <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , and not a <unk> <unk> .
And they have to do it .
Now , the work , we are <unk> , like <unk> , because the technology , because the technology , every day , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there is a <unk> , and I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m not going to be <unk> .
I &apos;m not going to be , because I want to use .
What is that this <unk> of the <unk> that we have to work about this , is that we have to <unk> , we have to <unk> , we have to work .
We can see our <unk> , with <unk> , with the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and the other <unk> , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And also if you see all <unk> , every day , we see that we see our <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> , &quot; <unk> , we &apos;re going to this <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , we see it , and we see it , we see it , we see it , and we see it , we see it , you all of all of this . &quot; <unk> , we see it , we see it , we see it , we see it , we see it , we see
&quot; <unk> , I have to <unk> this <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
And also when the answer is , it &apos;s not &quot; this <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of your <unk> , you have to <unk> , you know , and it was in other <unk> .
So , they see , things , things things , and the <unk> of life , and the <unk> of life , the life is a <unk> .
A time , it was this <unk> , there were some of the world , but it was not a <unk> of a <unk> .
The world of today today today , <unk> is <unk> , &quot; <unk> is a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
The answer is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> them , so I &apos;m going to do that I &apos;ll tell you , so I &apos;m going to <unk> .
<unk> this <unk> , two <unk> , two <unk> people .
The first , <unk> , it &apos;s that you &apos;re <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , it &apos;s very much of what it is very hard .
I &apos;m going to <unk> a <unk> , one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> has been <unk> to the data , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , with a million <unk> , with a million <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
What she was that he was that for every 10 percent of the <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> percent .
<unk> <unk> , there is <unk> , there &apos;s 10 percent of <unk> <unk> when they are only <unk> . Why are only <unk> . Why are ?
Because we <unk> with <unk> <unk> that we <unk> , is <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And they &apos;re <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , and of course , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> never never never never never never <unk> .
<unk> that &apos;s not only that these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> because it &apos;s not enough , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s not <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> for <unk> , that <unk> <unk> , that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of the <unk> .
And I think that <unk> the world .
&quot; And for <unk> , for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
You have to be the right right , if it &apos;s the right , it &apos;s <unk> ?
You don &apos;t want to be the <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> .
So this is the first <unk> . The first is that also if we can see the <unk> <unk> and <unk> a <unk> , and a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we &apos;re going to do with the <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> .
And this is for different .
A lot of these is that with a lot of the <unk> that we &apos;re going to <unk> one , it &apos;s not a different <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> a different <unk> that would be able to make a different <unk> that <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
It &apos;s also when it was a <unk> .
<unk> , it &apos;s more <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there is what the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> very <unk> very <unk> , and we see the things that we <unk> things that <unk> with the <unk> .
<unk> , when there are a lot of <unk> , is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and be <unk> <unk> to be <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s a example . I &apos;m not going to be <unk> with all of New York .
But it &apos;s what it &apos;s <unk> .
There &apos;s this <unk> <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> day . It &apos;s all of them .
It &apos;s not <unk> . But that he &apos;s <unk> , &quot; Well , <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; <unk> my <unk> are <unk> . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And two weeks of weeks , that &apos;s <unk> is <unk> every day -- the idea of the idea of the idea where we want to <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that we &apos;ve been <unk> when we &apos;ve been <unk> , and it was <unk> .
And the most <unk> that we &apos;ve got to <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
That &apos;s another example .
This is <unk> us .
There &apos;s been <unk> to be <unk> .
But the most important is that you know what you do you &apos;re <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s the most important .
The things that they don &apos;t have a lot of <unk> that can make it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ve got to my <unk> <unk> a new couple of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
A time <unk> were just a kind of a kind of <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , only <unk> , only after <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> , and a lot of <unk> .
So , I <unk> a new couple of the new <unk> , and I said , &quot; I said , &quot; You know , this is my <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> said , &quot; <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
You want to do it with the <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> , you want to <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; <unk> <unk> -- &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
I was <unk> , and after a little bit of <unk> , &quot; I mean , &quot; I want to say , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , and it was not a <unk> for a <unk> , then I &apos;m going to <unk> , then <unk> <unk> , then <unk> , then I &apos;ve been <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then I had never <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It was the <unk> .
But I <unk> .
Why ? I was a book for <unk> .
The reason I was that I was that with all of my <unk> , <unk> were <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I had to <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s not just <unk> when I <unk> <unk> , and when I <unk> a kind of <unk> , and I <unk> , <unk> , a kind of <unk> .
What I was <unk> , but it was not .
After you have to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in life , that the people who <unk> the <unk> that these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> <unk> , also , also , when the <unk> are good .
<unk> in the world &apos;s <unk> if you have to <unk> .
Because if you &apos;re not <unk> , not <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> .
&quot; <unk> when it was the <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; What was the reason that was the best , when it was <unk> , it was <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world we &apos;ve <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> the <unk> that are the <unk> .
You &apos;ve never <unk> <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , my <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> .
The <unk> of the <unk> -- that you &apos;re here -- it &apos;s &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
I mean , small -- that I &apos;m really <unk> that are really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I don &apos;t have to do , I don &apos;t have <unk> .
But it &apos;s not a <unk> .
<unk> , a <unk> of a couple of <unk> when there is only <unk> when there is only <unk> when you &apos;re <unk> , and you know , &quot; Why do you &apos;re <unk> ? &quot;
Is it it <unk> ? &quot; <unk> , the answer is <unk> .
The world is the world . What do I can see it ?
When there are <unk> of <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> a <unk> , and you know , you know , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , it &apos;s the <unk> .
I could do it .
<unk> <unk> , we don &apos;t have <unk> <unk> for <unk> .
So when people are <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> their <unk> .
In the last years , is <unk> in the world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- but only the only <unk> , but it &apos;s not that <unk> , and the only <unk> <unk> , because they are <unk> <unk> .
And when they have this <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> that the <unk> is <unk> .
So the <unk> is that in the <unk> is that in the <unk> , but we &apos;re going to <unk> .
<unk> that &apos;s <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all do it for <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> .
There &apos;s no <unk> that a little bit that &apos;s a little bit of the <unk> , but that it &apos;s not a lot of a lot of a little bit .
There &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , <unk> . I don &apos;t know that .
But I &apos;m not enough to <unk> a <unk> of the <unk> that the <unk> of our <unk> , our life .
Now , from the point of <unk> , I was <unk> -- I was <unk> -- the <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> .
What that this is that all of the <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
There are many of the world in the world , and you know , in the problem that &apos;s not <unk> .
The problem is that they have to <unk> .
So , the <unk> of the <unk> that I &apos;m a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that is <unk> , and <unk> is that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I mean , that these <unk> , it &apos;s not that there are just <unk> .
I &apos;m <unk> <unk> .
There are <unk> .
If you have a little bit of what our <unk> <unk> , it was <unk> in the <unk> where people have to <unk> , not only <unk> , not only <unk> , not only <unk> , not only <unk> , it &apos;s not only the <unk> .
This is what the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , not only <unk> to the <unk> -- because of this <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
For the <unk> , you can see it , you can see what you want to you to do it . &quot;
<unk> , people <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , but what <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s <unk> that you can &apos;t make a <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> of the world --
and I <unk> , I <unk> that , at the <unk> .
But then , <unk> , I &apos;m going to see that the <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> .
Because the <unk> of the <unk> is that if you <unk> in <unk> , in <unk> , <unk> that you can &apos;t be <unk> . &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> that we can <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> the <unk> .
You have to have a <unk> .
This is <unk> , maybe it &apos;s too <unk> , maybe , maybe , maybe it &apos;s <unk> for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you .
