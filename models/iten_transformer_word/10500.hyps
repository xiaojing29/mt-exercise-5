<unk> year I showed these <unk> for <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years , was the United States of the United States , <unk> , it was <unk> of 40 percent .
<unk> this <unk> <unk> of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is , in a sense , the heart <unk> of climate change .
They <unk> <unk> and <unk> of the summer .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
As you see , you get up to the blue <unk> .
That &apos;s the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> of summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , of five years or more , it &apos;s like the blood <unk> , which is <unk> from the body .
<unk> years , it was so , in this .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> the ground around the ocean <unk> , where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> are <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , that <unk> could <unk> , that <unk> could <unk> this point of not <unk> .
In a few <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> is already <unk> by water .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> last <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! Al <unk> : She &apos;s fine . The question is , if we &apos;re also going to be <unk> .
One is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> never <unk> levels of that .
This is the <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how to <unk> the sea level to <unk> <unk> <unk> , here is where the sea <unk> .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the other side of the planet : <unk> , the biggest <unk> of ice .
<unk> month , scientists have <unk> that the ice <unk> is in <unk> , and that the <unk> <unk> , which <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> feet of <unk> , like in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the biggest <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which few years ago , was <unk> .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population <unk> <unk> by that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : this <unk> is the source of <unk> water of this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when you get it , it happens to the <unk> water .
In California <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> of 40 percent .
The <unk> <unk> are in the crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they &apos;re <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in the world <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> are <unk> to a normal <unk> out of the normal and without <unk> .
<unk> times over the last 30 years , <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the whole <unk> .
If you look at it in the <unk> , you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years , we &apos;ve <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 <unk> every day .
Look at the <unk> area of the <unk> <unk> , from <unk> , and on both parts of the <unk> <unk> , where there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean .
The biggest <unk> of global <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
The oil is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And you &apos;re <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> <unk> .
But we &apos;re <unk> to a <unk> of the direction .
These are the projects over the last years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
At any way , there &apos;s a political <unk> in our country .
The <unk> of <unk> and oil <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
<unk> image I <unk> something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it on the <unk> .
This is the biggest flow of <unk> in America .
It &apos;s happened around <unk> .
The <unk> of one of the <unk> of <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> is a <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> here in America , and it &apos;s <unk> our economy .
<unk> the <unk> is <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
At the <unk> : <unk> here is a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The biggest society <unk> on the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is her <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- not know what they &apos;re talking about .
At <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> two <unk> .
This is a part of them , a part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> , we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> in our business .
That &apos;s why we &apos;re <unk> a lot of money in a <unk> <unk> to make a public <unk> and <unk> the truth in <unk> .
It &apos;s actually not <unk> .
We think it &apos;s <unk> -- it &apos;s also a good <unk> .
So , we don &apos;t <unk> of climate change .
We &apos;re going to do it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you &apos;ve heard a lot of them .
So , I &apos;m going to <unk> a <unk> structure for how it <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> are a little bit <unk> , but this is the sound of <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> is between the global <unk> of global <unk> , but the <unk> technology of <unk> that you see all changes .
<unk> a look at this : this is the <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
At the <unk> : <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic <unk> and the national security .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> America is in the crisis ; the economy , <unk> .
The <unk> that <unk> all of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and oil <unk> .
Now , there &apos;s a new , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan for <unk> America to work , <unk> more <unk> , and help <unk> the global <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we &apos;re going to solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
At the <unk> : This is the last .
<unk> : <unk> : It &apos;s about energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , a new <unk> network .
<unk> <unk> 2 : <unk> <unk> for jobs .
<unk> : <unk> America . It &apos;s time to be <unk> .
At the <unk> : A <unk> <unk> says , &quot; If you want to go , go from yourself . You go to yourself .
If you want to go far , you go , you go back , you go to the <unk> . &quot;
We have to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED I did a <unk> on <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to <unk> on how machine works .
So , it &apos;s <unk> . And for the other time , there was no , the <unk> was the biggest scientific experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles .
His job is to <unk> the conditions that were <unk> less than a <unk> of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second .
That &apos;s all that &apos;s just <unk> .
This is the machine under <unk> .
<unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk> .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> feet , and it &apos;s <unk> feet .
This is a <unk> image of <unk> in so you can see the <unk> .
<unk> 10 <unk> last year , we &apos;ve <unk> the machine for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was because of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> particles that had made all around the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with a <unk> part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles in the <unk> .
In other words , when we <unk> that image the 10 <unk> , <unk> that the machine <unk> , which is a great <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to do <unk> <unk> more or this , when someone <unk> on Google and <unk> that the page was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a <unk> impact on the <unk> .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had just these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine works at the <unk> of <unk> .
Now , the <unk> of you <unk> <unk> and <unk> , &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot;
And instead they can do it because when they &apos;re very <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees , at least <unk> degrees <unk> to that <unk> .
In one of the most <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> of <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think these <unk> <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> of about 30 <unk> .
They &apos;re about 50 <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , which we then did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
They &apos;re now <unk> everybody to their <unk> place .
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> will be again .
<unk> it , and we <unk> to get some data to <unk> or <unk> , and to keep them on the <unk> that <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering engineering engineering <unk> . It &apos;s easy to <unk> .
I think that &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s so hard , I think that &apos;s the value of things like <unk> .
I want to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> experiments of <unk> experiments in <unk> experiments , his <unk> Michael <unk> , he said , &quot; No , it &apos;s not <unk> for the human mind for the human mind , how we <unk> that are <unk> , and <unk> that we don &apos;t have to <unk> nature , and <unk> that our <unk> <unk> ,
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to <unk> when , from children , <unk> with <unk> .
<unk> as <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , actually , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way most of the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects , and my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I started <unk> , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having the <unk> <unk> of <unk> as a digital <unk> that <unk> moves on a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> information with both hands ,
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that we were going to explore the answer , building <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a big computer as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a big computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , they can <unk> them , and hear their own movement and <unk> .
But <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> , like <unk> , you can just <unk> them .
The <unk> are the example of a new tools to <unk> the digital information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement , the other , and the other , and as they become more <unk> , of the movement of their movement , of others , how they can explore and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show : if you <unk> it into a direction , the <unk> video , the <unk> video so , if we <unk> on the other side .
These <unk> are <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , they &apos;re <unk> to what they &apos;re doing around .
If they &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> and they can <unk> a little bit .
If they &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> and they can <unk> a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We then realized that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> was the <unk> of data , for example , which is a color of the <unk> of the <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> for <unk> of color in that central , where you &apos;re <unk> .
and I can <unk> it to <unk> color in that central to the color , where you &apos;re <unk> .
And we can <unk> it a little bit , we can <unk> a little bit of a place .
I &apos;m also <unk> <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , <unk> , and mathematics and games where people can try and do things , and <unk> the results immediately .
I &apos;m now --
This is a <unk> <unk> that I do with a <unk> program .
So here we have a game here here we have a <unk> of words that is <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> <unk> a letter to every <unk> , <unk> , at every <unk> <unk> , a letter to <unk> a <unk> letter . And as he <unk> <unk> words , he <unk> on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , <unk> , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try and get it .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the children <unk> <unk> <unk> , I did <unk> <unk> , I did it in a way that I <unk> them and <unk> a video .
They &apos;re very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things like this <unk> is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just say , &quot; <unk> of words , &quot; and they know what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who are other people who are <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , there on the right .
It was actually just <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> a tool for the <unk> of <unk> . He &apos;s <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now , he took a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> work !
So , <unk> <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It &apos;s a <unk> story , and it can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : It &apos;s a <unk> story , and it can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I &apos;ve been <unk> to show you is a <unk> , made of <unk> and <unk> music .
It &apos;s a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , to <unk> and <unk> music .
The <unk> here are <unk> as a <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> of these has four different <unk> , and you can choose to you .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> <unk> to your <unk> .
And I just <unk> <unk> a sound , &quot; sound &quot; and a <unk> sequence . &quot;
These are actually , you can control from live , like the <unk> and <unk> .
It <unk> it up a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are the <unk> effects of time and <unk> , which <unk> to the whole sequence .
<unk> how it works .
<unk> : <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> a <unk> sequence . &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , other base .
Now , I &apos;m going to <unk> a <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk>
<unk> : <unk> : And now I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> , so I can control the effect of live .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the entire sequence of the time on one side or on the other .
<unk> : <unk> : And now , now we &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> to give you a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : I can <unk> the sequence &quot; <unk> the <unk> . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the entire <unk> on the left the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain works and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibility that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to <unk> is that it &apos;s <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> , which is <unk> information in our way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time of all of you .
They &apos;re a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and love of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like that .
But , I said , something particular happened in my life and in my life , which was <unk> me to <unk> the whole relationship with this job .
The particular thing is I &apos;ve written this book , this <unk> called &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which , <unk> from my <unk> books , for some reason I was in the world and <unk> a big <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the result of that everywhere I &apos;m going to be <unk> now , people like if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
<unk> me now everybody <unk> and say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear me and say , &quot; You don &apos;t have any <unk> ? &quot;
You don &apos;t have any <unk> to write for the whole life without able to make a book that can <unk> to someone ? &quot;
How is it going to someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , and I remember that over 20 years ago , when I was <unk> to say to people -- I was a <unk> -- that I wanted to be a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> to the same <unk> from fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t <unk> to be able to have success ?
You don &apos;t have you that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> you ?
You don &apos;t get <unk> to do this <unk> for all of life without <unk> , and to die on a <unk> of dreams <unk> <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
You know , I have fear of all those things .
I &apos;ve always had fear .
And I also <unk> of a lot of other things that people could not <unk> .
As <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as it is , and write what I thought and <unk> <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It &apos;s <unk> that anybody who <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel to do .
But what &apos;s so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not ?
How did my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I don &apos;t remember one time in her 40 years of activity in his <unk> , and he was <unk> <unk> ?
It never us -- that <unk> of the <unk> John <unk> , how did it ?
Don &apos;t you that , <unk> ?
<unk> , the engineers like not have , in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
We have enough , we have this <unk> , and not only <unk> but <unk> of all kinds of , we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk> .
And I &apos;m not going to look at the <unk> <unk> of the dead <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , young and often for them .
And even those who are not <unk> look really look <unk> from their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before I was <unk> , in the last <unk> said , &quot; Every my book was <unk> me a little bit more <unk> about work of her life .
But we don &apos;t know it <unk> when you say it because we &apos;ve heard these things so long , we have all <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are somehow <unk> and <unk> the <unk> , and that art , finally , and that art , finally , <unk> , and that art , finally , and it &apos;s <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> to all over here today is : you &apos;re <unk> with this idea ?
It &apos;s OK , that &apos;s why it &apos;s also a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> <unk> to me , it &apos;s not good for this <unk> .
I think it &apos;s <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s also <unk> and I don &apos;t want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better <unk> our <unk> <unk> to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I &apos;m in my career .
<unk> -- <unk> look , they &apos;re pretty young , I &apos;m about 40 years old .
I still have about four <unk> of work in me .
And it &apos;s very <unk> that everything <unk> of the time , it will be <unk> by the world as the work that <unk> after the <unk> of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we &apos;re all <unk> friends here -- is <unk> that my biggest success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> !
You know , that &apos;s the kind of thought that <unk> person to start <unk> <unk> to nine of the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I want to keep doing this work that I love .
So , the question is , how ?
And so it looks like , after many <unk> , that the way to work to <unk> is to <unk> and write a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to have a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , which I &apos;m <unk> , and I &apos;m <unk> , and I &apos;m <unk> , and I &apos;m <unk> on which was written . And as I was going to go through the time , trying to see other society , trying to find other society to see whether they &apos;re going to have some better ideas and more <unk> .
as a <unk> people who are <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research <unk> me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
because they <unk> in <unk> and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don &apos;t believe that creativity <unk> creativity from men , OK ?
They <unk> that creativity was this spirit <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men with some <unk> and <unk> , for reasons <unk> and <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from far away .
The <unk> were the same idea , but they were that kind of spirit without a <unk> .
The <unk> , because the <unk> doesn &apos;t really understand that a <unk> was particularly a <unk> .
And I thought a <unk> <unk> <unk> that was <unk> <unk> <unk> , literally in the <unk> of a <unk> artist , a little artist like <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> out of <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the <unk> of that , and <unk> the result of that work .
<unk> <unk> <unk> you , that &apos;s the distance of the I &apos;m talking -- that <unk> you from the results of your work .
And everybody <unk> that was so that they were <unk> , right ?
So the <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like for example , right ?
If your work was <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , if your work was <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your job <unk> , it wasn &apos;t all <unk> , right ?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
And then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk> , and <unk> this great idea ; we put the human being in the universe , and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
This was the <unk> principle of <unk> and people to think that creativity is completely from <unk> .
And for the first time in history , <unk> to <unk> this or that artist as a <unk> rather than a <unk> person with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think I &apos;m going to <unk> someone , a simple person to believe that I think of being a <unk> as a source , the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a responsibility for the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> is a responsibility for the human <unk> .
It &apos;s like to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> and <unk> all of these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure pressure to <unk> the <unk> artists in <unk> 500 years .
And , if that &apos;s true , and I think that &apos;s , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do it ?
They go back to a more <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t <unk> 500 years of thinking about <unk> <unk> in a <unk> talk .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> people <unk> on their projects .
You probably don &apos;t tell you all about this thing .
But the question I &apos;d like to say , is why ?
Why don &apos;t you <unk> it ?
Because it &apos;s more sense of everything that ever ever ever heard to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process .
A process that , as anybody who ever <unk> to do something -- so basically , we all here -- it &apos;s not <unk> <unk> .
And , in fact , it can be completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , who has now 90 years old , but that was a <unk> for the whole life and he said that during his <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> out in the field , and he <unk> , in if a <unk> from <unk> .
He said it was like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> to her from the <unk> .
They <unk> it to get it , because it was <unk> the land under its feet .
I decided to have one thing to do at that point and it was , words , &quot; <unk> as a <unk> . &quot;
And so he came up to home and it was <unk> by this <unk> , and it wouldn &apos;t have to make something else that you could take a piece of paper and a pretty <unk> on the page .
<unk> times , we don &apos;t get enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without getting into the house and <unk> them , and she would <unk> them up through the <unk> , looking for , and she would <unk> through the <unk> , looking for , as she said , &quot; another <unk> . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this piece never -- there was the moments of the moments of the moments of <unk> , OK ?
So , he was <unk> at home and he was looking for paper and <unk> the <unk> <unk> through , and he was a <unk> right in the while he was <unk> , and then he said , that he was like , he <unk> with the other hand and <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in his body and <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the page and <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> , from the last to the first word .
So when I <unk> it -- it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not all my <unk> process -- I &apos;m not a <unk> !
I &apos;m a <unk> , and my <unk> , is <unk> ; I &apos;m <unk> at the same same <unk> every day and <unk> and work and <unk> over <unk> .
But I , in my <unk> , I &apos;ve <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I think it &apos;s also a lot of you the <unk> .
You know , even though the work and the ideas that I would <unk> me from a certain source I could <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it in a way we don &apos;t do it , but , rather , that it <unk> us ?
For me , the best example I &apos;ve been <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;ve <unk> different years ago for a <unk> .
<unk> of this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> <unk> <unk> , trying to control , <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , <unk> , and a day as he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , <unk> everything .
<unk> <unk> , and all of a <unk> , this little <unk> of <unk> , that it &apos;s going to be <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the <unk> , but it doesn &apos;t know how to <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , not have a <unk> , it has no <unk> .
So , it starts to <unk> this kind of old <unk> <unk> in him like , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and <unk> <unk> <unk> from this <unk> song .
They &apos;re not <unk> enough and I can &apos;t <unk> . &quot;
And instead of going to go into the <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> .
<unk> the whole process and made something completely new .
He just <unk> the sky and said , &quot; <unk> , &quot; Do you see I &apos;m <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Do you think it &apos;s going to write a song now ?
If you want to <unk> , you &apos;re going to be a <unk> moment when I can <unk> care of you .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And her <unk> process after this .
It wasn &apos;t the work , it was still <unk> as a time .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> out of him , the <unk> that he was <unk> that he was <unk> that he wasn &apos;t had to be a <unk> thing and <unk> .
but <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing that was not <unk> .
So how much I &apos;m going to change a little bit of a way I &apos;m going to <unk> and I &apos;m already going to <unk> .
This idea , I was <unk> when I was <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; and <unk> in one of those <unk> <unk> in which we &apos;re all working when we &apos;re working on something and we don &apos;t and we can start thinking that it will never be a book , that &apos;s the <unk> book .
Not only <unk> , right the <unk> book .
And I started to think of <unk> this project .
But then I &apos;m going to <unk> that <unk> to the air and <unk> .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> corner of my <unk> to a <unk> corner of the room .
And I said high <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; What , both of course , we know that if this book is not going to be <unk> <unk> my , right ?
Because as you see I &apos;m going to <unk> all I &apos;m going to do all I have no more than that .
So if you want it better , you &apos;ve got to <unk> and do your <unk> .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know , you don &apos;t do it .
I started writing the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to say , I &apos;m <unk> today to do my own part . &quot; Because it &apos;s like -- <unk> , OK , it &apos;s so , OK -- it &apos;s so , OK -- it &apos;s in the <unk> of Africa , <unk> and music that they <unk> for hours , and music that they <unk> for hours , and music , and music that they &apos;re going to <unk> and <unk> and music .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk> .
But every so much , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you &apos;ve all seen , because I know you &apos;ve all of them , at a certain point ,
It was like the time , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it wasn &apos;t doing anything different from , as the <unk> <unk> before , but it was <unk> .
And suddenly , not as a human as a human .
But it <unk> from <unk> and <unk> in <unk> in the fire of <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , he was , he <unk> her name .
<unk> your hands and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> this <unk> <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which is still going to be <unk> or in <unk> .
In <unk> , when a artist was made something impossible to <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
And it &apos;s <unk> because we need .
But , the problem comes the day , for the <unk> , when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 <unk> of <unk> and <unk> God , and <unk> God &apos;s not there .
It &apos;s just a <unk> with a lot of <unk> to <unk> , and maybe not <unk> to that <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God , as you know , and what &apos;s so it needs to do with the rest of her life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so <unk> if you &apos;re not to believe , <unk> , that the most <unk> of your being <unk> by you .
But I just want you to get you data from a <unk> source of this <unk> part of your life you have to go to <unk> when you &apos;ve finished .
And , you know , if we think of that , it &apos;s all changes .
And so I started <unk> , and it &apos;s certainly how I <unk> it for several months during the <unk> of the book that was going to be early <unk> , <unk> <unk> of my success .
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , I don &apos;t fear .
Don &apos;t just do it . <unk> your work .
<unk> to your <unk> , whatever it is .
If your job is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , <unk> <unk> to you <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for only moment through your <unk> , then , &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
<unk> , do you do the same <unk> .
And &quot; <unk> ! &quot; <unk> ! &quot; <unk> .
I think I think I &apos;m <unk> <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; only for <unk> had human love and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects on the human genome on what it can <unk> and discovery of new genes .
We &apos;re now <unk> a new path : we &apos;ve started <unk> the biology and now to <unk> the <unk> code in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We &apos;ve always been trying to <unk> questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; is something that many <unk> I think they &apos;ve <unk> to understand a lot of <unk> .
We &apos;ve tried different <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> from almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> <unk> from the world <unk> of the computer <unk> of the computer world .
Now , let &apos;s <unk> life , or create new life on this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the most small genome from the most of the ones that can <unk> in the lab .
And we &apos;ve tried to reduce the genome to <unk> a little bit more .
We &apos;re able to <unk> a <unk> of the genes about 500 that are here .
But when we take a look at his <unk> map , it &apos;s simple than our <unk> .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at a time , it &apos;s very <unk> that this can bring into a <unk> cell .
So I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> in a way that we <unk> <unk> the <unk> of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of &quot; Can we <unk> a <unk> ? &quot;
Is it the chemistry <unk> to produce these molecules that we &apos;ve never been doing before ?
And , in <unk> , can we can make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The speed with which we &apos;re able to <unk> the life is <unk> to <unk> .
Our ability to write the code , instead of <unk> code , but it &apos;s <unk> .
And our most <unk> results out of the <unk> on a <unk> <unk> .
We have <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before the first experiments .
But we &apos;ve found that DNA <unk> is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA <unk> , of 30 to 50 <unk> and it &apos;s a <unk> process : the <unk> is a <unk> process : the <unk> is <unk> .
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , to <unk> information from digital information <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a little virus that <unk> bacteria .
We designed <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> and we <unk> it in bacteria , the bacteria have <unk> this <unk> code and <unk> the <unk> particles .
The <unk> particles have been <unk> from cells , they &apos;re <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> .
I talked about recently with the <unk> <unk> <unk> that they &apos;ve been <unk> this model .
They have more <unk> than you .
I think this is a situation where the software can really build its own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we do things in big .
We want to build the entire <unk> of the <unk> .
They &apos;re more <unk> <unk> of code .
So we thought of <unk> in <unk> of the <unk> of the virus , so we could change the <unk> of a cell <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> , and if we <unk> with <unk> information in a computer , they &apos;re going to be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve found , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If we were used that <unk> <unk> , never <unk> states .
One of the process is design <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build more <unk> than small <unk> .
<unk> elements here .
You &apos;ve probably read you that you &apos;ve probably read that <unk> .
So , we have a <unk> code <unk> on four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> and <unk>
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> <unk> , and there &apos;s a <unk> order of <unk> <unk> , and there &apos;s a <unk> order to <unk> each <unk> .
So we can use the code for writing words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did at the beginning was <unk> .
Some were <unk> by the fact that it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
There are <unk> them and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And we started <unk> parts , <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , at every step , we &apos;ve been doing these <unk> <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re <unk> to create extremely <unk> as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to <unk> the process .
So , this looks like a <unk> <unk> .
When you start these <unk> much <unk> , more than 100 <unk> <unk> , we don &apos;t get <unk> directly into the <unk> <unk> .
You get to the <unk> of the tools of <unk> biology .
So we have <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA <unk> to <unk> DNA <unk> .
Here &apos;s an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , it can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> is <unk> .
In 12 , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s just like before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely <unk> .
We live under <unk> .
It &apos;s absolutely sure that life will be in space , and it <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
In fact , NASA has shown that this is happening .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we &apos;ve built these <unk> , just using the <unk> design of <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This image wasn &apos;t <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a so big <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we &apos;ve done a little bit of a time ago .
They &apos;re more <unk> <unk> of code .
It &apos;s the biggest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> that ever <unk> from man .
It has a <unk> weight <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a 10 without spaces , we <unk> <unk> pages to <unk> this code .
Now , how do we do it work ? How can we <unk> it ?
<unk> , through a virus is a <unk> game .
It &apos;s a little <unk> when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s <unk> cells as well as it is a <unk> cells like our : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the process of <unk> .
In <unk> , the <unk> is instead of <unk> in the cell , but we <unk> that we &apos;re able to do a <unk> <unk> from a cell <unk> from a cell <unk> from a cell cell phone and <unk> .
We have a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> species .
The two are different how men from <unk> .
We have <unk> some <unk> in more <unk> way we could decide what to choose to do for this <unk> .
He <unk> it up with the <unk> <unk> in a way to <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> is going to go into the cell .
And <unk> <unk> that we couldn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to <unk> over there .
This is one of the biggest <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So who thinks about evolution as a only <unk> at the time you get <unk> , it doesn &apos;t have much of biology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the DNA <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell , they don &apos;t <unk> one .
The <unk> <unk> we have <unk> it .
They <unk> , and he <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material , and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material , and we &apos;re <unk> with only the cell .
It has become blue because of the genes we have <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species , you go <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> of all in a new species , <unk> on the software that we &apos;ve <unk> in the cell cell .
All <unk> are <unk> , and <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code <unk> exactly what we &apos;ve been <unk> .
Now , this might look at <unk> , but it <unk> the software DNA <unk> , we can change things in a pretty <unk> .
Now , I &apos;ve already <unk> that there &apos;s not about <unk> <unk> -- but to progress from three million years and a half a half years and a half of evolution , and I &apos;ve already said that maybe we &apos;re going to create new species of the <unk> <unk> in which we &apos;re going to <unk> new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> when we think of our <unk> .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion people to <unk> billion people in the next 40 billion .
Right to give you an example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in <unk> ; in <unk> , there will be four .
We &apos;re <unk> now to find food , <unk> water and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> for six billion people .
<unk> even more <unk> to do it for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> .
That means percent of <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process to <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
In the most of the <unk> of all the CO2 <unk> from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
At the day today , because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> all over the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry only one of the <unk> industry , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from the reality that is <unk> and our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , because of these <unk> <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think of these 20 million genes or try to <unk> the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of a small team , and create more <unk> biology .
And it &apos;s just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> , chemistry or chemistry , chemistry or chemistry production , <unk> <unk> .
This is a few software <unk> on which we &apos;re working on to be able to <unk> and design species to the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly how their <unk> code .
Now we &apos;re <unk> on the <unk> generation of <unk> generation .
You &apos;ve seen <unk> <unk> from <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We have <unk> <unk> and third generation that will be <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> than the <unk> <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> to CO2 before , which we &apos;re working for cells to design that can achieve this , and we think we can achieve the first <unk> of <unk> in 18 months .
<unk> solar <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> in all the world , we &apos;ve found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we &apos;ve <unk> in <unk> .
It &apos;s going to be in the ocean , about <unk> feet <unk> to the temperature of water .
<unk> <unk> from CO2 using <unk> as energy as energy as energy source .
We &apos;re trying to figure out if we can <unk> CO2 , which can easily be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , we think we might be able to <unk> what we might be able to <unk> what is life is life . We have the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole <unk> industry .
<unk> . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t do it from TED , where ?
It &apos;s a main source of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working on the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk> .
You &apos;ve seen this year with flu , we &apos;re always back a year and a dollar <unk> when it comes to find the right <unk> .
I think that this can change building <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
That &apos;s how the future it could start to look at <unk> , the tree of evolution , <unk> the evolution with <unk> bacteria , <unk> , and finally <unk> cells .
We &apos;re so <unk> from <unk> people .
Our purpose is to do in a way of living living <unk> . Thank you very much .
First of all , I &apos;m going to show you , the most quickly , some <unk> , the new technology that we &apos;ve <unk> to a <unk> almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
It &apos;s a environment where you can <unk> is at local level that you can <unk> it with a huge amount of data <unk> .
We &apos;re seeing here are <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a <unk> <unk> , <unk> images like we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much the amount of information that we see , how big these <unk> of data or images .
Most of the <unk> photographs , but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that <unk> <unk> <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in any moment . It &apos;s also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a book , example of data not images .
This is the <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
So , I think it &apos;s just a text and not images of images , we can do something like that , to make sure it &apos;s a real <unk> of the text <unk> , not a picture .
It could be a little <unk> to read a <unk> book .
I don &apos;t tell you .
This is a <unk> example . It &apos;s a number of <unk> .
Every image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of read the real <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is nature a kind of a half .
We also have something with the corner of this <unk> number of The <unk> .
We &apos;ve created a <unk> <unk> much <unk> much <unk> than what you use in a normal <unk> and we <unk> the content .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
I thought this <unk> <unk> , and other <unk> <unk> <unk> , not to be <unk> .
Of course , <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this not to lose time , if not to say that we have <unk> <unk> to give even a <unk> in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. <unk> <unk> a picture of NASA <unk> .
So now I &apos;m going to <unk> something else .
This is now from a web to the web ; you can see it .
It &apos;s a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a very interesting <unk> computer <unk> to the very interesting computer <unk> , a student of <unk> of Washington , with the help of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s live on the web , <unk> <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from a picture of the other and have this kind of experience <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> of images here actually has a meaning .
The <unk> of <unk> computers have these pictures together , so that we can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk> . So here you see the <unk> of <unk> <unk> are <unk> . So here you see the elements of a <unk> or <unk> , and these things were all <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;ve been to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> data of <unk> and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that we &apos;ve done for the first time , we &apos;ll show what we &apos;re going to be really the key behind this technology , the key technology behind this technology , technology , <unk> technology . And it &apos;s not <unk> as <unk> as <unk> to the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> . And so on . <unk> of these <unk> <unk> a picture that has been <unk> to this model that &apos;s discovery to this model .
So they &apos;re all <unk> <unk> and they &apos;re all <unk> at the <unk> level in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to <unk> in this <unk> way .
You know , I would never thought to end up to work to work for <unk> .
It &apos;s very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think we &apos;re going to see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of <unk> : from those cell cell phones to the <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I can try and <unk> those <unk> .
Many are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
<unk> there is a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from the <unk> to the physics of this environment .
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now <unk> data from the whole memory of how the earth <unk> the <unk> of how it <unk> the earth , from the <unk> view and <unk> all those data together .
All those pictures become <unk> together , the greater than the <unk> of the parts .
You have a model of the whole <unk> .
Think of this as a <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> on Earth .
It &apos;s something that is going to be <unk> hand , that people will <unk> it , and the <unk> for who <unk> it with the use of the use of <unk> .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people .
If anybody &apos;s the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name , my <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> all of those data , and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> in that space , in that <unk> , in that <unk> , using the pictures of everybody else , and to have an experience that , using the pictures of everybody else , and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all that are <unk> , extremely <unk> of the land , <unk> not only from <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What ? What &apos;s your software is that at a certain point , in the next few years , all the photographs that are going to be <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is basically is <unk> .
It &apos;s creating <unk> , if you want , in images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the <unk> of images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> information <unk> that a lot of these <unk> <unk> .
As you make a <unk> of images on the web , you get a <unk> and the text on the page , it &apos;s a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture <unk> <unk> to all your pictures ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really huge . It &apos;s a <unk> effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it &apos;s really incredible . <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> you very much .
One of the main <unk> when you get <unk> and one of the <unk> of the <unk> research is the <unk> that you don &apos;t have the <unk> <unk> , between the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> in the wind <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> of plants .
<unk> to think that <unk> <unk> <unk> still beyond the <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , or that in <unk> , <unk> <unk> still the <unk> of the <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , and that the idea that the world in which we live in there is no sense , it &apos;s just a <unk> of reality , reality ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , right or bad , a lot of <unk> does .
And , of course , everybody <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . Everybody <unk> . <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
We have to <unk> the death of death , so we don &apos;t <unk> it , if we <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art .
What <unk> is the <unk> of the song , the <unk> of the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
He was my <unk> of the journey in <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> in <unk> , on <unk> , on <unk> , <unk> &apos;s mother &apos;s <unk> , the world &apos;s <unk> .
All these <unk> <unk> us that are other ways of thinking about other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you <unk> a second , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of the world create a <unk> life and <unk> that <unk> the planet , and it &apos;s important for the <unk> of the planet as <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all <unk> , dreams , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being from human imagination .
The <unk> is the great <unk> of humanity .
It &apos;s the <unk> of what we &apos;re is and what we can be as <unk> species .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> was successful <unk> <unk> <unk> was success to <unk> and <unk> much faster .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the <unk> of <unk> because it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s just <unk> , because it &apos;s <unk> , in the <unk> of the <unk> diversity -- and it &apos;s not even <unk> <unk> -- that <unk> diversity .
The <unk> of that is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you &apos;re <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just a <unk> or a <unk> or a series of rules .
One language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of the <unk> of every culture is in the material world .
Every language is a forest forest , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we &apos;re sitting here at least <unk> , at least half not <unk> in the <unk> of the children .
They &apos;re not <unk> to children , the <unk> , the less than <unk> something , which is already death .
What &apos;s more <unk> of being <unk> by the <unk> , of being <unk> by the <unk> , of being the last to talk about a language , of not <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the children ?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of someone in a few weeks , every two weeks , every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of a language .
And I know you &apos;re <unk> , &quot; Is it not so better ?
The world would not be a better place if we &apos;re all the same language ? &quot; <unk> , then we &apos;re all going to be <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> a <unk> thing that means to not the way to speak of her language .
I &apos;d like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we &apos;re <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say , &quot; different ways of <unk> &quot; I mean , &quot; I mean different ways of <unk> . &quot;
<unk> for example , this <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s not able to <unk> the blue color from green because the green is <unk> in the time , by which <unk> the <unk> .
They have a language and a <unk> rule , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; : you have to <unk> a different person .
And it &apos;s all <unk> in the past <unk> , but the <unk> is that in these <unk> families , where you &apos;re talking about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> nobody <unk> nobody <unk> .
They <unk> to hear and then go to talk .
I <unk> one of the most interesting <unk> with the <unk> that I &apos;ve lived , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;ve been <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , had never seen anything <unk> .
They <unk> the pictures of the land , they <unk> the research of a form or a <unk> and , not <unk> , they <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with the <unk> .
But <unk> not only <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> in them .
<unk> percent of the death <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We &apos;re <unk> at eight <unk> and we found two <unk> of death and when we <unk> to know , they &apos;ve been <unk> that one of them was so that he died , and then they <unk> it . And then they <unk> it the same .
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> the first 80 , I was <unk> a really interesting job when my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> <unk> between the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
To give a sense of <unk> , I should have to understand the <unk> culture , and that <unk> is not <unk> .
It &apos;s pretty a <unk> view of the world .
Very interesting .
If you &apos;re going to <unk> the great <unk> of the world , what would you do ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
One continent is always <unk> out , thinking that Africa <unk> is not <unk> <unk> . And instead of the <unk> is not the other than the <unk> of these <unk> very <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
What makes the interesting <unk> is the <unk> of life and death .
So <unk> make <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> of live in a way that for a moment , the <unk> becomes the <unk> .
For the <unk> <unk> <unk> to say , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , go to <unk> to <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re <unk> , is the spirit that <unk> you , how do you can tell you ?
So , it <unk> to these incredible events : <unk> in the state of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a pretty strong <unk> of power of mind in the body when it was <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk> .
I <unk> all the <unk> with the most <unk> are the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> civilization <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> in <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> never <unk> from <unk> .
In <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> by a <unk> , but their education is extraordinary <unk> .
The young <unk> are <unk> by <unk> families from <unk> or four , and live in a world <unk> <unk> and <unk> in a world <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> of nine years of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , nine months of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
That time , it &apos;s <unk> to the values of their society , values that they &apos;re <unk> that their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or for the <unk> <unk> .
And Al <unk> of this incredible <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> <unk> out and for the first time to them , at the age of 18 , see a <unk> . And in that moment of the <unk> of the first <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk> , everything that they learned in the <unk> <unk> , all of the <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , all of the <unk> <unk> . The <unk> says :
&quot; <unk> ? <unk> as I said . &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> . Now it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
They &apos;re called <unk> major and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re the <unk> of the world .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think about <unk> <unk> and the <unk> environment , the old <unk> history of <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> in his <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are more <unk> to the Earth of us .
The <unk> <unk> are not <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or in <unk> <unk> <unk> , but because of time and <unk> , and <unk> , they &apos;ve created a <unk> of the Earth is not about the <unk> of the Earth &apos;s <unk> but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> : the concept that the Earth can only live because it &apos;s <unk> by human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
<unk> to say that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> the mountain is a <unk> <unk> of his <unk> is going to be a different <unk> , and it will have a very different relationship with the mountain or that is a <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> that a mountain is a <unk> <unk> <unk> that a mountain <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
which is the <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
That made me a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you start to <unk> that these <unk> can create different reality , we start to understand some of them <unk> . They <unk> this <unk> .
I <unk> this picture at <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What makes the fascinating <unk> is not the potential of the <unk> of the <unk> , but its <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> by two elements .
On one side , this <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> a little <unk> that <unk> a little bit of <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> family <unk> said <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar <unk> to <unk> , <unk> .
If you &apos;re going to see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> that make from a different <unk> of species , <unk> it <unk> it .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity .
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> the man who <unk> was <unk> , with his <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> my <unk> , you can &apos;t <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you &apos;re done not to tell anybody to be <unk> . <unk> , but they can &apos;t be <unk> because they &apos;re <unk> by a <unk> that you find out in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s possible to <unk> only if we <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now , it &apos;s the <unk> that you find in this <unk> are <unk> of <unk> , the same kind of <unk> <unk> . The <unk> question : in a <unk> of <unk> species , how do these <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , like these <unk> <unk> two <unk> , but that if they <unk> in this way , they create a <unk> that is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
We use the great <unk> of evidence and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you <unk> to the <unk> , we &apos;re going to be <unk> .
What does it mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that the <unk> in the forest , and our <unk> in the same species .
If you <unk> it as <unk> their <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , you know , you don &apos;t know everything ? &quot; I said , &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : <unk> <unk> <unk> in a night of the moon and <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
And that &apos;s not going to <unk> , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> .
Now , the problem is that even the problem of us that they &apos;re <unk> <unk> them to <unk> them , but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of history of our history of the history of our real world , and it <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk> , or her <unk> <unk> , but rather like the <unk> was where we <unk> and <unk> <unk> , we have <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of mass diversity and <unk> . Now the problem is not the problem .
All the <unk> were <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities of life .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> don &apos;t have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> and <unk> that like <unk> don &apos;t have <unk> when they put <unk> out of <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It &apos;s the power of <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you look at a look at the world , you know , they &apos;re not <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that has been <unk> in the forest until a generation ago , and now <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> .
If we <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the <unk> <unk> of politics .
As the <unk> , the <unk> physics of a <unk> , is <unk> to <unk> , but the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of a <unk> , not only is not <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> in certain <unk> , because it &apos;s part of development .
And you can &apos;t understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you get <unk> .
I <unk> miles from <unk> in China , through the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> <unk> I realized what &apos;s behind is the <unk> that we &apos;re behind .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
The father &apos;s father <unk> to the <unk> <unk> .
The thing that means that it was <unk> to the Chinese times .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk> .
It was <unk> in <unk> at the age of two <unk> under his <unk> because he couldn &apos;t live without his <unk> .
The <unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
One day he <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , was <unk> to work for seven years .
<unk> <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> of <unk> is <unk> .
And then , all <unk> up to a choice .
Do you live in the world <unk> or <unk> or want to <unk> the world of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died said that his biggest <unk> was that , in our <unk> <unk> vision of the world , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination to a human imagination of human imagination to a human imagination , <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it &apos;s <unk> to <unk> that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> us , which <unk> <unk> us to the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , and we &apos;re talking about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has <unk> 300 years .
That <unk> story , I didn &apos;t know that we have the answers to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to be <unk> .
When the <unk> of these <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> <unk> different .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all <unk> the chance of being what we are : a <unk> species , which has to <unk> that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are great moments of <unk> moments .
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> of <unk> island , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> me , and this man , <unk> me , he <unk> the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The <unk> government wasn &apos;t <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> <unk> , and in the <unk> of our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
The family , <unk> for her life , the <unk> away all the <unk> , and all of her <unk> .
You know , you know , <unk> not the cold , we &apos;re going to be the cold , <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn &apos;t <unk> from the night or <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> away , you get the <unk> in skin <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did <unk> , I <unk> it , he <unk> it by creating a <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk> , she <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to talk about <unk> ? <unk> ? <unk> . And this , in different ways , <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to <unk> the <unk> control of a bigger area of the California &apos;s <unk> and <unk> <unk> together .
It &apos;s their new <unk> . It &apos;s called <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> all the resources <unk> .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , to end , I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> at least <unk> who &apos;s at least <unk> <unk> of the planet , <unk> that it doesn &apos;t <unk> at all .
For someone is home .
<unk> <unk> of human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the time . And for all of these kids , as the dreams of our children , become part of the <unk> <unk> of hope .
And finally , we &apos;re <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> that <unk> never to anything .
<unk> that <unk> --
&#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; , but we think the stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our audience to bring our public <unk> from how they saw <unk> from how they saw and , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> time for the central <unk> of <unk> : the world <unk> <unk> diversity in the <unk> world , and we need to find a <unk> world in a <unk> world , <unk> <unk> life in a <unk> world ,
where the <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I &apos;ve written in this book that I hope to <unk> other than you &apos;ve heard and <unk> <unk> , in fact , not <unk> them .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
<unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> of all <unk> society <unk> <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> : &quot; If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens . &quot; The way to do it is <unk> freedom . &quot;
The reason is , on one side , in the fact that freedom is in itself a value , is <unk> , useful for humans .
<unk> is the fact that if we &apos;re <unk> , we &apos;re all <unk> to do it all of us to do everything that we &apos;re going to <unk> our <unk> , without anybody who <unk> in our name .
The way to <unk> the freedom is <unk> choice .
The more choices people have , more <unk> , and more <unk> is their freedom , the <unk> , is their <unk> .
This , <unk> , it &apos;s so <unk> <unk> in the society that nobody <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it &apos;s also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made .
This is my <unk> . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to <unk> a simple <unk> on the <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> that you can buy for you a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> that nobody is already <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that nobody already <unk> is <unk> your <unk> .
That &apos;s what the <unk> is .
And then you go to the store <unk> , to buy a <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there &apos;s a big number of <unk> <unk> .
We can do six million <unk> and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in only one store .
<unk> <unk> there is <unk> choice .
<unk> <unk> : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the <unk> services , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> the phone , you don &apos;t <unk> it .
A <unk> of that , in the other , was that the phone never <unk> .
These days they went .
We have now a <unk> <unk> , especially between the cell phone .
Here &apos;s cell phones of the future .
My <unk> is that in a middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
If you don &apos;t have seen it in the store , you &apos;ve seen in the store , you &apos;re very <unk> .
And what the end is happening is that people <unk> into <unk> and <unk> this question . And it &apos;s the answer is ? The answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : It &apos;s not going on in the United States you <unk> from <unk> and <unk> you &apos;re <unk> what you &apos;ve got to do .
Instead , <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> says , &quot; OK , we could do it , or <unk> , &quot; At the <unk> , &quot; At these <unk> , &quot; <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> . &quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
You know , &quot; What &apos;s going to do ? &quot;
And the <unk> says , &quot; At the <unk> , and these <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; <unk> if she was me , what ? &quot;
And the <unk> , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not that a <unk> the weight and the responsibility for someone who knows something , <unk> the <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and so it &apos;s not in the <unk> <unk> to make decisions .
There &apos;s a huge <unk> of products , <unk> to people like me and you , that if you think of it doesn &apos;t make sense , because we can &apos;t <unk> it .
But if we can &apos;t <unk> , why do we <unk> them ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> that we call the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> of how fundamental is our <unk> now is a question of choice , as you can see in this <unk> . &quot; We don &apos;t want to <unk> the children . We don &apos;t want to <unk> the <unk> . We have to <unk> it .
And we can <unk> how many times we get there .
The <unk> , you have to decide that every <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person .
<unk> to the family and <unk> , a time the common perspective , almost for anybody , was that there was <unk> the most soon possible , and you get them to <unk> the <unk> , and you get to get the <unk> , and you get to get the <unk> .
The only one that was the only choice of when , and not even what to do after .
<unk> , it &apos;s all that &apos;s really to play .
<unk> students at a very smart , and they &apos;re going to be 20 percent in less work than a time .
And because they &apos;re not <unk> , because they &apos;re not <unk> .
but why are they <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> or not ? <unk> do it now ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> later ? &quot; I have to think before the kids or the <unk> ? &quot;
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
And they try to <unk> these questions , even though this <unk> doesn &apos;t <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and not get a nice <unk> at my <unk> .
And they really need to do it . They &apos;re important .
Now , the job : we &apos;re <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> , because technology <unk> us to work every minute , every day , from every corner of the planet , <unk> that <unk> from <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> , and I &apos;m not going to anybody who , where the <unk> works .
I don &apos;t say it , because I want to use it .
What does it mean , this incredible choice of choice we have about this work ? It &apos;s that we need to decide , <unk> at all , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son , <unk> , with the <unk> in a <unk> , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> , on the <unk> .
And even though they &apos;re all <unk> , every minute we see our <unk> son , we &apos;re also <unk> , we &apos;re also <unk> , &quot; <unk> to this call ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> to this <unk> ? <unk> I have to <unk> this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , it &apos;s not , it &apos;s all about your son , very different from what it was going to be in other conditions .
So , from any <unk> , look at all , small things and big , things and big , and life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibility , but not all was a question of choice .
The world today is going to be <unk> to this : The <unk> is , &quot; Is it a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? &quot;
The answer is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> them all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the <unk> .
<unk> this choice : two two <unk> people .
The first , <unk> , is that it <unk> instead of <unk> .
With a lot of <unk> between , and what you &apos;re going to do it .
I &apos;ll give you an example : a <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> has had access to the data of <unk> , the <unk> <unk> society , <unk> <unk> <unk> , with about a million <unk> <unk> in different <unk> .
What she was discovered for every 10 to the solutions that are <unk> in more , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> 2 percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s 10 percent <unk> <unk> than when they &apos;re available to when they &apos;re available to only five . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> between what you might choose , is to <unk> , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , <unk> , never <unk> .
<unk> that &apos;s not just that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don &apos;t have enough money , even though , it means that the decision is so <unk> that we also <unk> the <unk> of <unk> work .
They &apos;re not going to be <unk> to five <unk> <unk> for a year from <unk> <unk> , that would be <unk> to <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices .
And I think we &apos;re going to <unk> the world .
&quot; And to end , for the <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
<unk> right , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and you get the wrong <unk> .
So that &apos;s the first effect . The second is that even though we can <unk> the <unk> and make a choice , at the end of how we &apos;ve been <unk> by the result of how we &apos;ve been <unk> with less <unk> between .
And that &apos;s for several reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of <unk> between the which choose , if you &apos;re not perfect , and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that it could be better . And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> the choice , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> by the decision , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the decision ,
even when it was a <unk> decision .
The more choices there are , <unk> than any <unk> that is <unk> of <unk> choice .
And also , there &apos;s what <unk> call .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well <unk> as <unk> as the value of what we give things to <unk> .
And you know , when there are lots of <unk> , it &apos;s easy to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and be <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> is choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m going to be <unk> with all those who are not in New York .
But that &apos;s what it probably <unk> .
There &apos;s this <unk> to the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not going to be nothing . But what he thinks , &quot; Well , <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; All my <unk> to <unk> are away . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> right in front of home . &quot;
And it <unk> two weeks from the idea that is <unk> -- every day -- the possibility of <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> the <unk> for what we have , even when choice was <unk> .
And the most <unk> we have <unk> , the more <unk> <unk> <unk> us <unk> .
Here &apos;s another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It &apos;s about living the moment , and maybe it &apos;s a <unk> .
But the most important point is that anything you <unk> , you &apos;re not going to do not do other .
The things that don &apos;t have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a couple of <unk> .
It &apos;s almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were just a kind of <unk> them and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , were <unk> , only after <unk> , they were <unk> , just after <unk> a lot of times , they would go .
So , I went to <unk> a couple of when the <unk> were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> said , &quot; Do you want to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
I want them with <unk> or <unk> ? &quot; <unk> &quot;
&quot; <unk> them want to <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> them want to <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> -- &quot; <unk> to <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a little bit of a <unk> I &apos;d like to say , &quot; I want the guy that was the only kind of , it was not <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then I was <unk> <unk> , and then <unk> from the store , <unk> , <unk> , the best I had ever <unk> .
It was <unk> . With that was all the choice .
But I &apos;m going to do that .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> was <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
And I had <unk> <unk> . I didn &apos;t <unk> anything <unk> when I was just a kind of <unk> when I was going to do it , at least a perfect <unk> , at least a perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After I was <unk> to what I was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in life of people , not makes the <unk> that these <unk> <unk> that these have <unk> <unk> .
And this is less <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of <unk> , it makes it <unk> .
Because if I <unk> it , I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more to this .
&quot; You were better when you were worse , &quot; The reason he was better when he was worse , it was <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world where we live -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things to the <unk> <unk> .
You &apos;ve never <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; Yes , you want to do it . &quot;
I mean -- small <unk> -- that I &apos;m really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn &apos;t have any better , I &apos;m not <unk> .
But <unk> is not a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> , when you have a couple of <unk> <unk> when there &apos;s only that when you &apos;re not <unk> , and I &apos;m going to tell you &quot; Why ? &quot;
Who is <unk> ? &quot; The answer is <unk> . &quot;
The world is <unk> . What could I do ?
When there are hundreds of <unk> , and they <unk> a <unk> , and you &apos;ll see who is the <unk> , it &apos;s clear that the <unk> are <unk> ,
You could have better .
With hundreds of <unk> <unk> , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even though the result is <unk> , they <unk> and they give them <unk> and they give them <unk> to them .
In the last years , the <unk> is <unk> in the world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is just that people have experiences because the <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation think that <unk> is their own .
So the final result is that in general , we &apos;re better , but we &apos;re going to do it .
Let me tell you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all get to take for good and it &apos;s completely <unk> . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no <unk> that a little bit better choice is better than at all but not to <unk> at all , but from this not to be a little bit better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a <unk> value , <unk> . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve been <unk> from a piece of the level where the choices <unk> of our life .
Now , from <unk> <unk> -- I &apos;ve almost finished -- from the point of view , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What it allows all of this choice in <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There are a lot of places in the world , and you &apos;re going to be <unk> , where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice .
The problem is that they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I &apos;m talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what makes you <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> yesterday than those <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> of money .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , is not just that they &apos;re <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
They do it be worse .
If a little bit of what in our society <unk> <unk> choice in those where people have too few people have too few possibilities , it would not only be their lives to <unk> but also our <unk> .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income is good at all -- not only the poor people -- not only the poor -- not only the poor people -- not only the poor people --
So , &quot; <unk> , you can become everything you want . &quot;
<unk> , people &apos;s culture , &quot; But what &apos;s going to happen ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s <unk> that you can &apos;t <unk> in a glass <unk> . &quot;
&quot; A <unk> imagination , a <unk> view of the world --
and I <unk> it , I <unk> it , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I realized that the fish know that fish <unk> knows .
Because the reality of fact is that if you &apos;re <unk> in <unk> , so that it &apos;s not possible . You can &apos;t <unk> the freedom . You <unk> the <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> in a way that it &apos;s going to <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
Everybody needs a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> .
Thank you very much .
