<unk> year I showed these <unk> for <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years , had the <unk> of the United States , <unk> , <unk> percent .
And I <unk> this <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is , in a sense , the heart of climate system .
They <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
As you see , you know , it &apos;s <unk> to the blue <unk> .
That &apos;s the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , of five years or more , it &apos;s like the blood , which here is <unk> from the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been like this .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> around the ocean <unk> where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , are
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> from global <unk> , that amount of <unk> , <unk> this point of not <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is already <unk> by water .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> last <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : She &apos;s fine . The question is if we also do it .
This is a reason this is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> from the north .
This is a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> had never <unk> <unk> like that .
This is the <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> , here is where we <unk> the sea <unk> .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> on the planet : <unk> , the largest <unk> of ice <unk> of the planet .
<unk> month , scientists have <unk> that the ice <unk> is in <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> at six feet of the <unk> , as in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the third largest <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> of ice , which few years ago , they see a few years ago .
<unk> percent of the world &apos;s population <unk> half of the <unk> water from that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : this <unk> is the source of this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when you get it , the same happens to the <unk> water .
In California , <unk> on the <unk> <unk> is <unk> percent .
<unk> <unk> are in crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they &apos;re <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the world leads to a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and without <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years respect to the <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of all <unk> .
If you look at it in the <unk> context , you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we have <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every day .
Look at the area of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and on both of the <unk> <unk> , and on both of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where there is a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the oceans .
The largest cause of global warming , together to the <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of two countries with more emissions with China , together to China .
And you &apos;re going to build a lot of other <unk> .
But we &apos;re <unk> to a <unk> of direction .
These are the <unk> projects over the last years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there is a politics <unk> in our country .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> oil have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I <unk> image something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it on the <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> in America .
It happened around <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> is a <unk> and happy .
It &apos;s <unk> here in America , and it &apos;s <unk> our economy .
<unk> the <unk> is more <unk> .
It &apos;s at good price , <unk> and the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : From here , you know , from the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
The largest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , one part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> , we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> in our business .
So , for this <unk> is <unk> a great amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> and <unk> the truth on <unk> .
In fact , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it &apos;s <unk> -- it also has a good <unk> .
So we don &apos;t understand the climate change .
We could do it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : You &apos;ve heard about it very much .
So , we &apos;re going to be a turn to a <unk> structure for <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> machines are a little <unk> , but this is the sound of <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> is between the <unk> of global warming , but the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> that you see change everything .
And we look at this , this is the <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic and the <unk> of the national security .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> America is in crisis ; the economy , <unk> , <unk> crisis .
The <unk> that all of the <unk> of : our <unk> from <unk> <unk> , as <unk> <unk> and oil <unk> .
Now , but , there &apos;s a new solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan for <unk> America to work , <unk> more <unk> , and help <unk> the global <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we can solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
<unk> : This is the last .
<unk> : This is about <unk> <unk> . This is about <unk> energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , a new <unk> network .
<unk> <unk> 2 : <unk> <unk> <unk> for jobs .
<unk> : <unk> America . It &apos;s time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A old <unk> <unk> says , &quot; If you want to go to go out , you go out of alone .
If you want to go far , you go together . &quot;
We have to go far , fast .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED I did a <unk> on <unk> .
And I decided to <unk> <unk> on how the machine works .
So I &apos;m going to go . And for those who were not , the <unk> is the largest <unk> experiment ever <unk> -- miles of <unk> .
<unk> is <unk> the conditions that were <unk> <unk> that were <unk> <unk> of a second from the beginning of the universe -- to <unk> million times a second .
And all of that is simply <unk> .
This is the <unk> machine .
<unk> these <unk> <unk> into the <unk> .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called <unk> -- is <unk> <unk> feet . And it has a <unk> of <unk> feet .
This is a <unk> image of <unk> in building so you can see the <unk> .
The <unk> of last year we <unk> the car for the first time .
And this was <unk> by <unk> .
It was because of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of control .
It &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> of particles that had done all the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles in the <unk> .
In other words , when you put that image the 10 <unk> , you know that the <unk> machine , which is a great <unk> .
I don &apos;t know whether that &apos;s this to do it , when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the <unk> page was this .
And that means we had a <unk> impact <unk> to that scientific .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to be just these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine works at the <unk> of <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you <unk> and <unk> , &quot; It &apos;s not true . I &apos;m too <unk> . &quot;
And they can do it because when they &apos;re very <unk> , they get <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees , at least <unk> degrees , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> between the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that are <unk> of about 30 <unk> .
They are about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
Now they &apos;re now <unk> everybody to their <unk> place .
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> is going to be again .
And I <unk> it , and we <unk> it to get data to <unk> or <unk> , and continue so our <unk> to find out what the universe is .
Now , of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering engineering <unk> . It &apos;s easy to <unk> .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s the value of things like <unk> .
I &apos;d like to end with the words of a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which , in <unk> <unk> experiments , <unk> <unk> experiments , he said , &quot; No , no is so <unk> for the progress of the human mind how much the <unk> that the ideas of the human mind how <unk> that the ideas of how much of science is <unk> , and that our <unk> are <unk> , and that are not <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to <unk> <unk> when , from children , <unk> with <unk> .
<unk> as <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , actually , to think and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way most of the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with objects , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I started <unk> , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having a computer , instead of having the only <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> as a digital <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as a digital <unk> with both hands ,
and we start our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that we could <unk> the answer , building the <unk> , building the <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a very large computer as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a very large computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , they can <unk> them , and they have a screen and they have a screen and they have a <unk> <unk> .
But <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> them .
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools for <unk> information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement of their movement , and as they become more <unk> , <unk> of their movement , of the <unk> , and the other , as <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you some video -- if you put it in a direction , the <unk> video so , if we were on the other side of the <unk> back .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of other people .
If you <unk> them , they &apos;re <unk> to what they &apos;re doing around them .
If they come up , they <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
If they come up , they <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We then realized that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was the <unk> that we could use common on data , for example , &quot; <unk> &quot; a color like if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as <unk> of <unk> and I can <unk> it to <unk> color in that central color , where you get <unk> .
and I can <unk> it to <unk> the color in that .
And we can do it a little bit about it , we can <unk> a little bit .
There are also <unk> possibilities of <unk> , as <unk> , the mathematics and the <unk> and <unk> of <unk> where people can try things , and <unk> the results immediately .
I &apos;m --
This is a <unk> sequence that I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a game of words that is in half between <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> , you know , <unk> a letter to every <unk> , <unk> , at every <unk> <unk> a letter to any <unk> , and as he <unk> <unk> words on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you &apos;ve got a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try to do .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the <unk> children in <unk> <unk> , I did in a way that I <unk> them and <unk> them and I <unk> a video .
They are very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things that this is that you don &apos;t have to give people many <unk> .
And I just wanted to say , &quot; <unk> of words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who are <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , right there .
It actually wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to build a tool for the <unk> of <unk> . He &apos;s <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now , he brought a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> work ! Yeah !
So , you <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> .
-- <unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> .
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with the final <unk> , and it can decide how you get <unk> .
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with the final <unk> , and it can decide how you get <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I &apos;ve been <unk> time to show you is a <unk> , and <unk> music .
It &apos;s a <unk> , that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , to <unk> and <unk> music .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of these four different <unk> , and you can choose which to use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of your <unk> to your <unk> .
And we just wanted to do <unk> a &quot; sound &quot; and a <unk> &quot; sequence . &quot;
These are actually , you can control live , like <unk> and <unk> .
I <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are the effects of <unk> as time and <unk> , that <unk> to the whole sequence .
<unk> how it works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> one <unk> in two <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> in a <unk> <unk> , <unk> in a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , on the other <unk> .
Now , you &apos;re going to have a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> : Now , I &apos;m going to <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> : And now I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> , so I can control the <unk> , so I can control the <unk> in live .
<unk> : I can <unk> the entire sequence time <unk> over time or on one side .
<unk> : <unk> : And now we &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> .
<unk> : I can <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> .
So I don &apos;t have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
And now , finally , I can <unk> the entire <unk> on the left the <unk> <unk> . The <unk> &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> as our brain and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of this <unk> of this path , and even some possibilities we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to <unk> is that it &apos;s <unk> this new generation of objects to <unk> with media <unk> , which <unk> information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time of all of you .
They are a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it &apos;s more than this , of course .
It &apos;s also love love and the <unk> of my life .
And it doesn &apos;t look like that .
But , said , something particular happened was <unk> in my life and in my career , that <unk> me to <unk> the entire relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I <unk> this book , this <unk> called &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which , <unk> , &quot; which , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And the result is that everywhere I &apos;m <unk> now , people like I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I &apos;m going to be <unk> now and say , &quot; You don &apos;t <unk> fear of you don &apos;t <unk> to do better ?
You don &apos;t fear on <unk> to write all life without <unk> to be able to create a book that can <unk> people ? &quot;
What can you do you do ? &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , and I remember that over 20 years ago , when I was <unk> to say , I was a <unk> -- that I wanted to be a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> to the same <unk> by fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t <unk> that they wouldn &apos;t be successful ?
Do you not fear the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> you ?
Do you have no fear of doing this <unk> for all life without <unk> that nothing has ever come out and die on a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
So you know , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I fear of all those things .
I always <unk> .
And I also fear of many other things that people can &apos;t <unk> it .
As <unk> and other things are <unk> .
But , as it is , I thought , and I was <unk> <unk> <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It &apos;s <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel <unk> to do .
But what is there is so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not ?
How did my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I don &apos;t remember one time in his <unk> years of activity in <unk> that he was asked <unk> <unk> ?
It never -- that <unk> of the <unk> of John <unk> , how did it go ?
Don &apos;t do that , you know ?
<unk> , the engineers like not have certainly not , in the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
We have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> but <unk> of any <unk> , we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk> .
And not <unk> other than looking at the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often for them .
And even those who don &apos;t seem to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before he died , in the last <unk> said , &quot; Every my book has <unk> me a little more &quot; <unk> <unk> about the work of their life .
But we didn &apos;t know about <unk> when I say it because we &apos;ve heard these things so long that we have completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and the <unk> , at the end , they always <unk> to the <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> to all over here today is : you &apos;re agree with this idea ?
I &apos;m going to do this -- because even <unk> from a <unk> distance to me not . It &apos;s going to be good for this <unk> .
I think it &apos;s <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s also <unk> and I don &apos;t want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better <unk> our great <unk> to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I am in my career .
<unk> -- look at it &apos;s pretty young , I &apos;m about 40 years .
I still have four <unk> of work in me .
And it &apos;s very <unk> that anything that &apos;s going to be <unk> by the world as the work that <unk> after the work of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we &apos;re all <unk> friends here -- is <unk> that my biggest <unk> is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> thought !
You know , this is the kind of <unk> thought that leads a person to start <unk> <unk> to nine <unk> at nine <unk> and I don &apos;t want to do that .
I love to keep doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it looks like , after many <unk> , that the way to work to keep writing is that to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to get a distance of security between me , which I &apos;m <unk> , and my natural <unk> <unk> on which he wrote , and my natural <unk> on which was to do it , and I &apos;m going to look through the time , looking for other societies , and trying to find other societies to see whether it &apos;s better ideas and more <unk> .
as to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research <unk> me to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
because they were <unk> in <unk> and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don &apos;t believe that creativity is <unk> by men , OK ?
And it turns out that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to the men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for reasons <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from far .
<unk> were the same idea , but they were that kind of <unk> without a <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> , because the <unk> doesn &apos;t really <unk> a <unk> of a <unk> was particularly <unk> .
And I thought a <unk> was this <unk> of <unk> that was literally <unk> in the <unk> of the study of an artist , a little bit like the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> out of <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the <unk> of that work .
<unk> <unk> , that &apos;s the distance of which I talk -- that <unk> <unk> you from your work .
And everybody <unk> that was so <unk> , right ?
So the <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things , as for example , not ?
If your work was <unk> not <unk> all the <unk> , everybody &apos;s <unk> that you &apos;ve got <unk> from this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it wasn &apos;t your work , right ?
Everybody knows that it was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so the people are <unk> the creativity in <unk> for a long time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and everything , and we <unk> this great idea ; we put this great idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> this great idea ; we <unk> this great idea ; we <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> .
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people think that are <unk> to think that creativity is completely <unk> by <unk> .
And for the first time in history , you start to <unk> this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> , a person with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think it &apos;s going to someone , a simple person to believe that they &apos;re like a <unk> as a source , the <unk> and the <unk> of all the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a responsibility to too much to <unk> human <unk> .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> the <unk> and creates all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s been this pressure to have <unk> artists in 500 years .
And if that &apos;s true , and I think it &apos;s , the question becomes , and I think it becomes , and now ?
Can we do it <unk> ?
<unk> go back to a more <unk> understanding of the relationship between human relationship between human and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t <unk> 500 years of thinking about <unk> thinking in a <unk> <unk> .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience who are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of , <unk> , you do that <unk> people <unk> <unk> to <unk> on their projects .
You probably don &apos;t all of you &apos;re not all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to <unk> is -- why not ?
Why not we don &apos;t we do that ?
Because it has more sense of everything that I &apos;ve ever heard of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
And so , as anybody who ever <unk> to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- it &apos;s not <unk> <unk> .
And , in fact , it can sometimes look completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , who has now 90 years , but that has been a <unk> for all of life and said that during his <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> it , in the <unk> , and they <unk> it , in the <unk> .
He said it was like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> <unk> to her <unk> .
And he <unk> it , because he did it <unk> the land under his feet .
I decided to have one thing to do to do that point and it was , words , &quot; <unk> as a <unk> . &quot;
And so <unk> to the house and it was <unk> by this <unk> , and it wouldn &apos;t have to do something that we take a piece of paper and a <unk> <unk> , and <unk> on the page .
<unk> times you don &apos;t get enough to be enough fast , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> it through the <unk> and she would <unk> it through the <unk> and she would <unk> it through the <unk> , looking like she said , &quot; another <unk> . &quot;
Then there were those times -- this is not -- there were times in the moments , there were no moments in which it almost <unk> , OK ?
So , he was <unk> at home and he was looking for paper and the <unk> <unk> through , and he <unk> a <unk> right in the while he was <unk> , and he said , he was like if he <unk> with the other hand and the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk> , but in the <unk> , from the last word to the first word .
So when I <unk> it -- it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not all my <unk> process -- I &apos;m not a <unk> !
I &apos;m a <unk> , and my <unk> way of <unk> is ; I &apos;m <unk> at the same <unk> every day and <unk> and work and <unk> <unk> over <unk> .
But even I , in my <unk> , I &apos;ve <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I think it &apos;s a lot of you the <unk> .
You know , even though the work and the ideas <unk> me <unk> from a certain source I can &apos;t <unk> <unk> .
And what is this ?
And how can we <unk> it so we don &apos;t get to get it , but rather , that <unk> <unk> <unk> us ?
And as I think , the best example of the <unk> that I have a different example of a <unk> .
I was talking about this , and you know , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> artist <unk> , trying to control , <unk> , <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , he got <unk> , and a day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , <unk> it , <unk> it all for him .
<unk> you go fast and everything is <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> , which comes in his head as <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , you know , and it wants , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the <unk> , but it doesn &apos;t know how to <unk> .
It has no <unk> piece of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , it has no <unk> .
So , it starts to feel this kind of old <unk> that he &apos;s going to be <unk> , and I &apos;m going to <unk> it from this <unk> song .
I &apos;m not <unk> enough and I can &apos;t <unk> . &quot;
And instead of going to go to the <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> .
<unk> the entire <unk> process and made something completely new .
I just wanted to the sky and said , &quot; <unk> , you don &apos;t see that I &apos;m <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Do you seem to write a song ?
If you really want to <unk> , you know , you &apos;re going to take care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> <unk> other today .
<unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And his process <unk> <unk> after this .
Not the work , the work was still <unk> as always as always as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when the <unk> , the <unk> that outside he <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that outside he <unk> it back and <unk> it back to where it was , <unk> that it wasn &apos;t had to be a <unk> and <unk> .
but I <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> <unk> a conversation with <unk> and this thing that was <unk> and <unk> , but it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
So , how much that story is going to change a little bit even the way I <unk> and I &apos;ve already <unk> .
This idea , I was <unk> when I was <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; and <unk> , &quot; and <unk> in one of those <unk> of the <unk> in which we &apos;re working in something and we &apos;re working on something , and you don &apos;t start thinking it will be a <unk> , that &apos;s going to be the <unk> book .
Not just <unk> , just the <unk> book .
And we started to think about <unk> this project .
But then I &apos;m going to <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and I <unk> my face to a <unk> <unk> in the room .
And I said to high <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; What , we know that if this book is not going to be <unk> <unk> my , not ?
Because as you see I &apos;m going to <unk> all I have , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want it better , you have to <unk> and do your <unk> .
Okay . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , you don &apos;t do it .
I started writing the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to be <unk> that I &apos;m <unk> today to do my own part . &quot; Because -- at the end is so , OK -- <unk> it does in the <unk> of Africa , the people <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk> .
But every so much , you know , you know , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you &apos;ve all got to be , at some point , a <unk> like this .
It was like time , it was <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it wasn &apos;t doing anything different from , as the <unk> <unk> <unk> before , but it was <unk> .
And it &apos;s not just a <unk> of a human .
But it <unk> from <unk> and below <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , he <unk> it with her name .
<unk> hands and <unk> to <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , &quot; God , &quot; God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> this <unk> <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , which you still feel in <unk> or in <unk> .
In <unk> , when a artist has done something impossible and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
And it &apos;s <unk> because we need it .
But , the problem comes the day , for the <unk> itself , when you go and <unk> and <unk> that are 11 <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> God doesn &apos;t have more .
It &apos;s just a <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , and maybe you never get <unk> to that <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God again as <unk> , and so what has to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so <unk> if you can &apos;t believe , <unk> , <unk> , that the most <unk> <unk> of your being from you .
But you just want you to <unk> data from a <unk> of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk> when you &apos;ve finished .
And you know , if we think about this , we think about it all changes .
And so I started to <unk> , and it &apos;s certainly been like I <unk> for different months in the book that <unk> soon , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel that I feel <unk> by this is , I don &apos;t fear .
Don &apos;t do it . You just go .
<unk> <unk> for your <unk> , any of any time can be .
If your work is <unk> , you know .
If the <unk> , you &apos;re going to be <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for a <unk> <unk> , for a <unk> <unk> , then you &apos;re going to <unk> . &quot;
<unk> , you do the same <unk> .
And I said , &quot; You know , &quot; you know , &quot; You know .
I think and I think it &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; <unk> &quot; to you , even for having had love human and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know , I &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects on the human genome , on what it can <unk> and discovery of new genes .
Now we &apos;re <unk> a new path : we started <unk> the biology and now starting from that digital code we &apos;re <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We always tried to <unk> big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many <unk> I think have <unk> to understand various levels . &quot;
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> terms .
We &apos;re <unk> from almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome is <unk> to go from the world of the <unk> of the computer <unk> .
Now , what can we <unk> the life , or to create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> species of the genome between those that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> a more small <unk> .
We &apos;re able to <unk> a <unk> of genes about 500 are here .
But when we look at his <unk> map , it &apos;s <unk> simple than our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at a time , it &apos;s very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell .
So I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> <unk> , so that we could <unk> <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of &quot; can we <unk> a <unk> ? &quot;
Is it the chemistry <unk> to produce these big molecules that we never could create before ?
And , in case , we can make a <unk> ?
<unk> is simply a piece of <unk> material .
The speed that we are able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the code , rather than it is <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> .
And our most <unk> results the <unk> on a <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve been <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> many <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before <unk> .
But we found that <unk> DNA is very hard .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA <unk> , of 30 to 50 <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> process : the more <unk> is <unk> , <unk> there are .
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , starting from the <unk> information of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a little <unk> that bacteria <unk> .
We designed the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA <unk> about <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part of it is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> it in bacteria , bacteria have <unk> to read this <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> . They &apos;re <unk> out of cells , they &apos;re <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I talked about recently with <unk> <unk> industry that they have certainly <unk> this model .
They have more than you .
And I think this is a situation where the software can really build its own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we could do things in the bigger .
<unk> to build the entire <unk> of the <unk> .
They are more than <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> code .
So we thought we &apos;re going to <unk> in the size of virus , so that we can change <unk> to understand what the <unk> are the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if we <unk> information with <unk> information in a computer , they have to be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We found , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If we could use that <unk> <unk> <unk> never <unk> to do it .
One of the process is designing <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to <unk> <unk> to build smaller <unk> that <unk> together .
<unk> elements here .
You probably read that you have read it .
So , we have a <unk> code that we have a <unk> <unk> on four <unk> : A , <unk> and <unk>
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , and there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and there &apos;s a <unk> order to every <unk> .
So we can use the <unk> code for writing words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did we do at first .
Some of them have been <unk> by the fact that it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> simply <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> <unk> them and <unk> <unk> them .
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> with <unk> from five to seven to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to them to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , we <unk> these <unk> in <unk> so that we &apos;re <unk> to create a very <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re <unk> to create a very <unk> <unk> as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to <unk> the process .
So , it looks like a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When you go to these <unk> <unk> , the more than 100 <unk> <unk> , you don &apos;t get closer to the <unk> in the <unk> .
And it comes to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> biology .
So we have <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA to <unk> DNA to <unk> the <unk> .
Here &apos;s an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> is <unk> .
In 12 hours , 24 hours , it &apos;s <unk> exactly as it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can <unk> completely .
You should live under <unk> .
They are absolutely sure that the life <unk> in space , and they &apos;re <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
In fact , NASA has shown that this happens .
This is a <unk> image that we built using these <unk> , simply using these <unk> , just using <unk> with <unk> design <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This image not been <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a very much <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we &apos;ve done a little time ago .
They are more than <unk> <unk> of <unk> code .
It &apos;s the largest <unk> of a <unk> structure ever <unk> by man .
It has a <unk> <unk> <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 without spaces , we &apos;ll just <unk> it up there just <unk> pages to <unk> this <unk> code .
Now , how do we do it work ?
Of course , through a virus is a <unk> game .
It &apos;s a little bit more <unk> when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s more simple when it comes to this is <unk> cells like our : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the <unk> process .
In <unk> , the <unk> is instead of <unk> in the cell , but we have <unk> <unk> that we are able to do a <unk> <unk> from one cell to another and <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> species .
<unk> are different how men are <unk> by <unk> .
We &apos;ve <unk> some <unk> <unk> in a way that you could choose to do this <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> went into the cell .
And we had to <unk> that we didn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried still <unk> <unk> in there .
This is one of the largest <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere , <unk> in a second , <unk> in a <unk> , <unk> in a <unk> , <unk> in that species .
So who thinks about evolution as a <unk> <unk> at the time you have no <unk> of biology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell didn &apos;t get one .
The <unk> <unk> we have <unk> it .
It &apos;s <unk> , and it has <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material , and we <unk> it , and we <unk> with only the cell .
It has become blue because of the genes that we have <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species are go to <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> of all in a new species , <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when we <unk> the code that exactly what we &apos;ve <unk> .
Now , this might seem <unk> <unk> , but we can <unk> the software , we can change things in a <unk> way .
Now , I &apos;ve already <unk> that there &apos;s no <unk> about <unk> -- but progress from three million years and a half million years and a half years and evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create new <unk> of the <unk> version that we <unk> new species on this process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion people and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give an example : I was born in <unk> .
Now , there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in <unk> ; in <unk> , there will be four .
We &apos;re <unk> now to find food , <unk> water and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> for six billion people and a half billion people .
<unk> more <unk> to do that for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> of <unk> .
That means 100 million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process of <unk> process , it will be a huge challenge .
In more <unk> we need to realize the whole <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
And I think of today , because of the <unk> <unk> all over the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry only one of about <unk> , and you think how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here are <unk> data from reality and our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , thank you to these <unk> <unk> <unk> , that can create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think of these 20 million genes or <unk> or <unk> to <unk> <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of a small team , and create more <unk> biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> <unk> , <unk> chemistry or chemistry or <unk> production , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software that we &apos;re working on for being able to <unk> and design species to computers .
Well , we don &apos;t know how to be .
We know exactly what their <unk> code .
Now we &apos;re <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> generation .
You saw you who <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> .
We have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> or different <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a great <unk> <unk> of food and <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> to CO2 before , which we &apos;re working on for cells that we &apos;re working for a cells that can achieve that , and we think we can have the first <unk> of <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> <unk> <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> in the world , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> we <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> in the deep ocean , about <unk> feet deep to the temperature of water .
<unk> <unk> by hydrogen <unk> as <unk> as energy as energy as energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand whether we can <unk> CO2 , which can easily be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , we think we might be able to <unk> this , we could be able to <unk> this that the <unk> of <unk> , &quot; which is the <unk> of <unk> the entire <unk> industry .
<unk> . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can &apos;t you do that ?
<unk> a main source of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working for using the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk> .
You saw this year with the flu , we always go back to a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s about finding the <unk> .
I think that &apos;s going to change building <unk> in <unk> .
Here &apos;s how the future might start looking at <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> the evolution with <unk> , <unk> , and finally <unk> cells .
We are so <unk> to <unk> people .
Our goal is to do so that we live enough to <unk> . Thank you very much .
First of all , I &apos;m going to show you , the <unk> possible , some fundamental <unk> , the new technology that we brought to <unk> <unk> to a <unk> almost a year ago exactly . This is <unk> .
It &apos;s a environment where you can <unk> is at local level that <unk> with a huge amount of data <unk> .
Here we &apos;re seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a <unk> fast <unk> , <unk> the images as we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much the amount of information that we see , how big these <unk> of data or the images .
Most of them are common <unk> , but this is a for example , is a <unk> <unk> by the <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in any moment . It &apos;s also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a book entire , example of data not images .
This is the <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
So , the <unk> that &apos;s just <unk> and not images , we can do something like that , to actually see that it &apos;s a real <unk> of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little bit <unk> to read a <unk> book .
I don &apos;t <unk> it .
This is a more <unk> example . This is a <unk> number of <unk> .
Each big image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And you really really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the real <unk> version of a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> , which is for a <unk> <unk> .
We also do something with the corner of this <unk> number in the <unk> .
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much <unk> than the one that you use in a normal <unk> and we <unk> the content .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see it here .
Or even other models , or even the <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
And we think this <unk> to put up to the <unk> and other <unk> , not <unk> to be <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this not to lose time , if not to say that we have <unk> <unk> to <unk> in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> over a NASA <unk> .
So now we &apos;re going to do something else .
This is actually live on the Web ; you can see it .
This is a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other one is a <unk> research at a very interesting <unk> made by <unk> <unk> , a student of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s live on the web , <unk> by <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of experience experience <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of images here actually has a meaning .
So , the <unk> of the computer <unk> have <unk> these images together , so that <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk> <unk> . So you see some <unk> of a <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> at <unk> level .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of <unk> data and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that we &apos;ve done for the first time in the summer of show you what <unk> is really the key behind this technology , the <unk> technology , the <unk> technology , <unk> technology . And it &apos;s not <unk> that we &apos;ve got in the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> and so on .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> images of those <unk> in <unk> , and <unk> and so on . <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> a picture that you have a picture that you have a picture that you &apos;ve found out of this model .
So they &apos;re all <unk> <unk> and have been all <unk> at the <unk> level in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to <unk> this way .
You know , I would never thought of it .
It &apos;s very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think we &apos;re going to see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of <unk> : from those cell phones to those <unk> <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> , <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I can , I can try and <unk> those <unk> .
Many are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
<unk> here , you know , you &apos;re a series of pictures -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from <unk> to the <unk> of this environment .
The <unk> point is that we can do things with the social environment . This is <unk> data from the entire <unk> of how we <unk> the land , from the <unk> point of view and <unk> all that data together .
All those pictures become <unk> together , the <unk> of the <unk> parts .
You have a <unk> of the land that you have a whole thing model .
Think about this as the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> on Earth .
It &apos;s something that we &apos;re <unk> in complexity , as people who are <unk> it , and the <unk> that we &apos;re <unk> for those who are <unk> <unk> .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people .
If somebody &apos;s the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name , my <unk> <unk> , my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of those data , and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> to the <unk> in that space , in that <unk> , using the <unk> of anybody else , and we have an experience of social kind and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all this is <unk> <unk> of every part of the land , <unk> not only by <unk> <unk> and <unk> images and <unk> images and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> : Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What &apos;s your software ? What your software is going to do is that at a certain point , in the next years , all the pictures were <unk> by anybody in the entire world would be basically be <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is it basically is <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> by <unk> , if you want , you want , in the images .
And it &apos;s doing it on the content of the images .
And it becomes very interesting if you think of the <unk> information that many of these <unk> images .
As you do a research of images on the web , you get a <unk> and the text on the page , it &apos;s a <unk> and the text on the <unk> of the pictures .
Now , what happens if that picture is <unk> all your pictures ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really huge . It &apos;s a <unk> effect .
CA : <unk> , it &apos;s really incredible . <unk> .
<unk> : I &apos;m going to <unk> you very much .
One of the main <unk> when you get <unk> and one of the <unk> research is the <unk> to live in the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of plants .
<unk> to think that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , or that in <unk> , the <unk> <unk> still the <unk> of the <unk> , and the idea that the world in there is no <unk> , and that the idea that the world in there is no <unk> , but it &apos;s just a model , it &apos;s just a model ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , well , or bad , a lot of <unk> does .
And of course , all of course , all the <unk> of the <unk> .
All <unk> . All right . <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
So we need to <unk> the death of death , so we don &apos;t <unk> if it and <unk> --
We all have an art .
What <unk> is the <unk> of the song , the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of <unk> .
He was my <unk> of the journey in the <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> , the <unk> of the world .
All these <unk> <unk> us that there are other ways of thinking about it , other ways to move around the world .
And if you go to a moment , it &apos;s a <unk> that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of <unk> in the world create a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and it &apos;s important for the <unk> of the planet as <unk> <unk> .
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> , and you can <unk> the total <unk> of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , ideas , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> in being from the human imagination of <unk> .
<unk> is the fantastic <unk> of humanity .
It &apos;s the <unk> of what we can be in and what we can be as <unk> as <unk> as <unk> .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> much more quickly .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or on the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> -- because it &apos;s <unk> , or -- in the <unk> of the <unk> diversity -- and you don &apos;t even know it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s not even <unk> at the <unk> -- that &apos;s <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> .
The <unk> of that is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just a <unk> or a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
One language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle with the <unk> of every culture comes in the material the world .
<unk> : <unk> is a forest of mind , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we &apos;re sitting here at <unk> , at least half not <unk> in the <unk> of children .
They don &apos;t get <unk> to children , the <unk> , which means not to do something , which are already <unk> .
What is more <unk> than the <unk> of being <unk> by <unk> , of the last to talk about a language , not <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of somebody in some world &apos;s <unk> every two weeks : every two weeks of a <unk> <unk> and <unk> it <unk> with it in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I know somebody of you are <unk> , &quot; Don &apos;t do better ?
The world would not be a better place if we all the same language ? &quot; <unk> , then we talk all about <unk> . &quot;
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> a <unk> thing means that we can &apos;t talk about your language .
I &apos;d like to do a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we &apos;re <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say &quot; different ways of <unk> <unk> . &quot; I really want different ways of <unk> . &quot; I really mean different ways of <unk> .
So for example , this <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , which <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> that you can &apos;t <unk> the blue color from green because the <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the forest <unk> , which <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> <unk> : you have to <unk> a person who talks about a <unk> different language .
And all of that has <unk> in the past <unk> , but the <unk> is that in these <unk> <unk> <unk> , where you are talking about seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> nobody <unk> .
You <unk> to listen and then <unk> to talk .
I had one of the most interesting <unk> with , which I lived , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;ve <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> forest <unk> had never seen anything <unk> .
They <unk> the <unk> of the ground , they <unk> to a <unk> or a <unk> , they didn &apos;t know , they have <unk> that <unk> <unk> , and they have <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> don &apos;t just <unk> the <unk> .
They <unk> them .
<unk> percent of <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We &apos;re <unk> at eight <unk> and we found two cases of <unk> death and when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was so <unk> that he &apos;s <unk> , and then they <unk> it . They <unk> it . <unk> . <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> .
<unk> were able to recognize the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> the species .
<unk> years old , I was really interesting , when my <unk> <unk> of <unk> , and I was <unk> <unk> , if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> between the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And to make sense of <unk> , I should have to understand the <unk> culture and the <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s rather than a <unk> <unk> vision of the world .
<unk> .
If I &apos;m going to <unk> the great <unk> of the world , what would you do ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent always <unk> out , thinking that Africa has no <unk> <unk> . And instead , and the <unk> is not the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes interesting is the <unk> of life is the <unk> of life and death .
So the <unk> are <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> live in a short <unk> way that for a short <unk> becomes the <unk> .
For that <unk> <unk> , I said , &quot; <unk> go to <unk> &quot; God . &quot;
We <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> God . &quot;
And as you &apos;re <unk> , it &apos;s the spirit that <unk> you , how do you do it <unk> ?
So it &apos;s <unk> to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> in the state of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather than the power of the <unk> of the <unk> of the power of the mind when it was in a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> with which I lived the most <unk> are the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> civilization that once you get on the <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> never had <unk> <unk> .
In <unk> , I &apos;m <unk> by a <unk> , but their education is extraordinary <unk> .
<unk> are <unk> by <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> , and live in a <unk> world , and live in a <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> of nine years of the way to <unk> the nine months of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of the mother , now are <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
And for all this time , they &apos;re <unk> to values , that <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or for the <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or for the <unk> <unk> .
And the <unk> of this incredible <unk> , they come out and for the first time in life , at the age of 18 , see a <unk> . And in that moment of <unk> <unk> <unk> , all that they &apos;ve learned in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , everything they learned in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , all of that they &apos;ve learned in all of it . The <unk> is <unk> back and says .
&quot; <unk> ? &quot; I said . &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> . Now it &apos;s now you &apos;re going to <unk> . &quot;
They call the largest <unk> and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the <unk> of the world .
This is very important level .
When we think about <unk> <unk> and the <unk> environment , and the old <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> in his <unk> , or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are <unk> to the Earth of us .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by <unk> .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> , but because of time and <unk> , they created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> , not on the concept of <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> : the concept that can only live because it &apos;s <unk> from the human <unk> .
What does that mean ?
I mean , a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> is a <unk> that <unk> is a <unk> human being <unk> that <unk> its <unk> is going to be a very different relationship and it will have a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> a mountain is to be <unk> .
<unk> is a <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
And that made me a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> .
If you go to <unk> that these <unk> can actually create different reality , we could actually start to understand some of their <unk> <unk> . <unk> this <unk> .
I <unk> this picture at <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you &apos;ve heard about the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What makes fascinating is not the <unk> potential of the <unk> of the <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> by two elements .
On one hand , this <unk> <unk> that <unk> a <unk> of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> you have a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit of the <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> with a <unk> of a <unk> of the family <unk> said <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you &apos;re going to see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is basically <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . <unk> &apos;t creates a <unk> of reality .
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> my <unk> you can &apos;t <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you &apos;re done , you can &apos;t tell anybody to be <unk> . <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s possible to <unk> only if you could <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now , it &apos;s the <unk> that are <unk> in this <unk> are <unk> of <unk> , the same kind of <unk> to <unk> the <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> species , how do these <unk> <unk> , they do these <unk> <unk> , they create <unk> , they create a <unk> <unk> <unk> , they create a <unk> that &apos;s <unk> <unk> , they create <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
We use the great <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> , that can <unk> <unk> .
But if you go to the <unk> , we &apos;re going to <unk> , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that we <unk> in the forest , and our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If you look at it as a <unk> their <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , you don &apos;t know everything ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take the <unk> <unk> in a night of the moon and <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
And you don &apos;t get <unk> to it , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , &#91; <unk> &#93; the problem is that the ones that have to us who have to heart <unk> <unk> them , but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of history of our <unk> in the history of the <unk> of our real world , and it <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , 300 years , not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk> , but rather like the <unk> was where we <unk> and <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the diversity of <unk> and <unk> of the planet . Now the problem is not the change the change . Now the problem is not the change the change .
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities of life .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> don &apos;t have <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> <unk> and <unk> as they have <unk> <unk> and <unk> as they have <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s not the change or the technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It &apos;s the power of <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you look at a look at the world , you know that these are not <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They are <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of the existence of <unk> that go beyond their ability to <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> , a <unk> that lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that seems to be <unk> by the <unk> that seems to be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> .
If we go on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the <unk> <unk> of politics .
As the <unk> , the <unk> physics of a <unk> , is <unk> at a <unk> level , but the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of a <unk> , not only is not just <unk> , but <unk> in certain <unk> , because it &apos;s a part of the development .
And you cannot understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you go out of the beginning .
I have the <unk> miles from <unk> in China through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> <unk> , I realized what there is behind the <unk> that we &apos;re going to talk about .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
The father &apos;s <unk> at the <unk> <unk> .
And that means that it was <unk> to the Chinese time .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk> .
It was taken by <unk> to <unk> at age of two <unk> under his <unk> because he couldn &apos;t live without him .
The <unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> .
One day has <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to work for seven years .
<unk> pain of <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> of the <unk> is from <unk> .
<unk> , all of it <unk> to a choice .
<unk> to live in the world of <unk> or we want to <unk> the world of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died said that his biggest <unk> was that , in our <unk> to go to this <unk> <unk> of the world , not only <unk> the entire <unk> of human imagination at a <unk> <unk> of thought , but one day , it would <unk> it <unk> it that there was other possibilities .
And it &apos;s <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , which has given us the agriculture , which has made us <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has to <unk> 300 years .
That <unk> history doesn &apos;t <unk> me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we <unk> to come .
When these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> <unk> different <unk> .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all <unk> the chance of being what we are : a <unk> species , which has to <unk> that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are great moments of <unk> . And there are great moments of <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> me , and he <unk> , he <unk> the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The government didn &apos;t always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> <unk> , and in the <unk> <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> for his life , the <unk> away all of the <unk> , and all of his <unk> .
You want to know that the <unk> don &apos;t <unk> the cold , it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn &apos;t <unk> from night or <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> the <unk> in the <unk> skin and <unk> in your hand . When I did <unk> , he <unk> it , he <unk> it by it by <unk> , he <unk> it and <unk> it in their hand . When I did <unk> , <unk> it into their <unk> . When I did it <unk> , and they <unk> in their hand . When I got <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> it in their <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> , they
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> created a <unk> , has <unk> another dog and <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> you talk about <unk> with nothing ? &#91; <unk> &#93; And this , in different ways , &#91; <unk> &#93; is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> the <unk> government has <unk> to <unk> the <unk> control of an area of <unk> , the <unk> of the largest California and <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s their new <unk> . It &apos;s called <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . <unk> all the <unk> resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And finally , I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> at least at least who we &apos;ve been in these <unk> areas of the planet , <unk> that it &apos;s not <unk> at all .
For somebody &apos;s house .
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that we <unk> to the <unk> of the time . And for all of these children , are <unk> <unk> of hope .
So , we &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> --
&#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; but they &apos;re the stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell stories of the world . Every month our website <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public in places to <unk> our public places that are <unk> by how they saw and , they <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and we have to find a <unk> of life in a <unk> world and <unk> .
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope to <unk> some <unk> , in case you don &apos;t know them .
I &apos;d like to start with what I call &quot; the &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> of all the <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> . &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; If we want to <unk> our citizens &quot; The <unk> for it is <unk> freedom . &quot;
The reason is , on one hand , in the fact that freedom is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> for human beings .
<unk> is what if we are <unk> , each of us can act for just to do everything that <unk> our <unk> , without any <unk> that we &apos;re <unk> in our <unk> .
The way to <unk> freedom is <unk> .
More choices , the more <unk> , and the more of the <unk> , the more of the <unk> , is their <unk> .
This is , <unk> , so <unk> <unk> in society that nobody has <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it &apos;s also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I was a simple note on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that nobody has already <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
Here &apos;s what the <unk> is .
Then you go to the <unk> store for <unk> one : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> <unk> .
We can do six million and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one <unk> .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the <unk> services , <unk> <unk> , <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> .
You get the phone , you don &apos;t get it out .
A <unk> of that , between the other , was that the phone never <unk> .
These days have gone .
We have a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , especially between cell phones .
Here are the cell phones in the future .
My <unk> is that in the middle , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
If you don &apos;t have seen it in the store under the house , you &apos;re very soon certain that soon <unk> .
And what happens to the end is that people go into the <unk> and it does this question . And you know what the answer is ? The answer is &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> not happens in the United States that you &apos;re <unk> from <unk> and the <unk> you &apos;ve got to do .
Instead , I go out of the <unk> , and the <unk> says , &quot; OK , we could do it , or <unk> , &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> <unk> and these <unk> <unk> . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You know , &quot; <unk> , what do you do you do ? &quot;
And the <unk> says , &quot; He has these <unk> and these <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> and <unk> and <unk> it has these <unk> and these <unk> . &quot;
&quot; What do you do you do ? &quot;
And you said , &quot; You know , if she was me , what would you do ? &quot;
And the <unk> , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call it &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; , &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; , &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> .
But it &apos;s not a <unk> the weight and the responsibility of taking <unk> of <unk> <unk> that you know , <unk> , <unk> , to <unk> other than <unk> that -- and so it doesn &apos;t know -- and so it &apos;s not in the <unk> to take to take a decisions that is the patient .
There &apos;s a huge <unk> of <unk> products , you know how I and you , that if you think about it is not a sense , because you think it doesn &apos;t make any sense , because we can &apos;t <unk> .
But if we can &apos;t <unk> it , why can &apos;t we <unk> them ?
The answer is that the <unk> to <unk> , we call the <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of as <unk> is our <unk> now is a <unk> of choice , as you see in this <unk> , &quot; we don &apos;t want to <unk> children . We want to <unk> their <unk> at the right time . &quot; <unk> . &quot; <unk> &apos;t <unk> . &quot;
And we can <unk> how many times we get there .
And the <unk> that means that every <unk> , you have to decide that kind of want to be .
<unk> to the family and the <unk> , a time the common perspective , almost for anybody , was that there was that you <unk> the <unk> of it soon , and they &apos;re going to <unk> children the <unk> soon .
The only one that the real choice was with who , not when , and even what to do after .
<unk> , it &apos;s really to play .
<unk> to students very smart , and they <unk> their 20 percent in less work at a time .
And they &apos;re not because they &apos;re less <unk> , not because they &apos;re <unk> .
But why are I <unk> , I started to <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> or not ? &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> later ? I got to think before the kids or the career ? &quot;
They are <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this <unk> doesn &apos;t <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and <unk> and not get a good <unk> at my <unk> .
And they really need to do that . They are important questions .
Now , the work : we &apos;re <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because the technology <unk> us work every day , from every day , from every day of the planet , <unk> that from <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> , and I &apos;m not going to anybody who &apos;s <unk> .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What does that mean , this incredible freedom of choice we have to work ? It &apos;s that we have to <unk> , <unk> at every time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son , <unk> in a <unk> , the <unk> in a <unk> , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And even though they &apos;re all <unk> , every minute that we see our son <unk> , we also have <unk> , we also <unk> , &quot; I should answer this ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this <unk> ? I got to <unk> this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is &quot; no , this makes the <unk> of your son very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the look , things and big , objects and big , objects and life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but not everything was a <unk> of choice .
The world of today <unk> to this : The <unk> is , &quot; Is this a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? &quot;
The answer is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> them all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the <unk> of those <unk> .
<unk> this choice <unk> two effects of people .
The first one , <unk> , is <unk> <unk> instead of <unk> .
And so many <unk> in which you choose , it becomes very difficult to do that .
I &apos;ll give you an example , a <unk> study : a <unk> study <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> my <unk> <unk> data , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in different <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> in different <unk> <unk> .
What she found out of the <unk> for every 10 solutions that are <unk> in more , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> two percent .
With 50 percent <unk> , there &apos;s 10 percent in less than <unk> than when they &apos;re just <unk> it . Because ?
Because with 50 <unk> between which choice , is hard to decide , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And <unk> , and again , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , and of course , <unk> never comes out .
<unk> that doesn &apos;t just mean it &apos;s these <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don &apos;t have enough money , even to say that the decision is so <unk> that <unk> the <unk> of work .
They &apos;re not <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> to five <unk> per year from <unk> <unk> , that would be <unk> to <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices .
And I think it &apos;s going to <unk> the world like this .
&quot; And to end , for the <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
You want to make the right decision , if it &apos;s for the <unk> , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the <unk> , and you get the wrong <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can <unk> <unk> <unk> and make a choice , at the end of the result of how <unk> <unk> states with less <unk> between the <unk> .
And that for different reasons .
One of these is that with many <unk> in which we could have one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s perfect , it &apos;s just as easy to imagine that it would be better . And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of choice , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of choice , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> of choice , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the decision ,
even when it was a decision that &apos;s decision .
<unk> there are , more of the <unk> of any <unk> that is <unk> of the <unk> of choice .
And also , there &apos;s what <unk> call <unk> .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well <unk> as the value we give things to <unk> from what we do .
And you know , when there are many <unk> , it &apos;s easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and be <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m <unk> with all those who are not in New York .
But that &apos;s probably what it probably <unk> .
There &apos;s this <unk> to the <unk> .
<unk> place .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It &apos;s all about them .
It &apos;s not <unk> . But what he thinks he thinks , &quot; Well , <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; All my <unk> to <unk> are <unk> . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> right in front of home . &quot;
And it <unk> two weeks , it &apos;s going to <unk> -- every day -- the chance of <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> the <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And more of the <unk> that we have <unk> , the more the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It &apos;s about living the moment , and maybe it &apos;s going to live .
But the most important point is that anything you know , you &apos;re going to do not do the other .
The things that don &apos;t <unk> many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were just one kind of , <unk> them and <unk> <unk> , they were <unk> , only after <unk> a <unk> , they were <unk> , only after <unk> a lot .
So , I went to <unk> a new when the <unk> were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> said , &quot; Do you want to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
Do you want them with <unk> or with <unk> ? &quot; <unk> &quot; or &quot; <unk> &quot;
&quot; <unk> &quot; ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> them want to <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> -- &quot; <unk> to <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a little bit of a little bit , I said , &quot; I want the only kind of , &quot; he had no idea what it was , so for a <unk> . I all <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then <unk> from the store , <unk> , with the best couple of <unk> I &apos;d ever had .
It was the <unk> . I had to do the best .
But I &apos;m going to worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that I was worse with all that choice , my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
<unk> I had <unk> <unk> . I didn &apos;t <unk> when I was just a guy , but when I was just <unk> 100 different , <unk> , at least one kind of had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but it didn &apos;t perfect .
After I was <unk> to what I was <unk> in <unk> , in <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in life of people don &apos;t do that <unk> the <unk> that these have <unk> <unk> to the <unk> .
And this is less <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the <unk> world , it makes it <unk> .
Because if I <unk> it , I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more to this .
&quot; He was better when he was worse , &quot; The reason he was better when he was worse was when he was worse was even worse than <unk> .
<unk> , in the world where we live in -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are at the <unk> .
You never have <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; Yes , you want to do it . &quot;
I mean -- small <unk> moment -- that I &apos;m really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn &apos;t do it better , I didn &apos;t get <unk> .
But <unk> it doesn &apos;t always have a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> . And when there &apos;s just that kind of <unk> is that when you &apos;re not <unk> , and you &apos;re <unk> , &quot; Why ? &quot;
Who is <unk> ? &quot; &quot; The answer is <unk> .
The world is the <unk> . What can I do that ?
When there are hundreds of <unk> of <unk> , and you get a <unk> , and you know who is the <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s clear that the <unk> you are .
<unk> could do better .
With hundreds of <unk> <unk> , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people are taking decisions , even if the result is <unk> , they <unk> <unk> and they give them their own .
In the last years , the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only one , but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is that people have <unk> experiences because the <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation they think that <unk> is their own .
So the final result is that we &apos;re better , <unk> , but we &apos;ll get worse .
Let me show you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and is completely <unk> . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no <unk> that a little bit better choice is not <unk> at all , but it doesn &apos;t have a lot of choice . But it &apos;s not a lot of choice .
There &apos;s a <unk> value , <unk> . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve <unk> from a piece of the <unk> that the <unk> choices that the <unk> choices of our life .
Now , from the <unk> point -- I got almost finished -- from the <unk> point of view , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What it allows all of this choice in <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you get <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice .
The problem is that they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> that I &apos;m talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what it does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> has talked about yesterday about how those <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> are <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> of money .
I mean these choices , <unk> and <unk> , it &apos;s not just that are <unk> .
They are <unk> <unk> .
They do have worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows us to <unk> <unk> in those where people are too much <unk> , it would not only be their life to <unk> , but it also our own life .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of the income is good at all -- not just the poor people -- not just the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> .
And to <unk> , &quot; <unk> , you can become everything you want , &quot; --
<unk> , people in culture , <unk> , &quot; What about that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s <unk> that you can &apos;t do anything in a <unk> of glass . &quot;
&quot; A <unk> imagination , a <unk> vision of the world --
and I <unk> it so , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I realized that fish the fish know , the long knows .
Because the reality of fact is that if you <unk> in <unk> the <unk> , so that &quot; everything is possible &quot; you can &apos;t <unk> the freedom . &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
If you look at the <unk> , you know , you can <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
They all need a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
