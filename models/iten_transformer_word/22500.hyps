<unk> year I showed this <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for nearly three million years had the size of the United States , it &apos;s <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> percent .
I love this <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a way , the heart <unk> of climate change .
They <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You see , you can see , you <unk> all the way down to the blue <unk> .
That &apos;s the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , five or more , it &apos;s like the blood , which you &apos;re <unk> here from the body .
In 25 years it &apos;s been done by this way .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> around the ocean <unk> where there are enormous <unk> of <unk> <unk> that , <unk> , <unk> , are <unk> in <unk> by the <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of global warming , that amount of <unk> , that amount of <unk> , we can <unk> this point of not <unk> .
In some <unk> , you &apos;ll get the <unk> <unk> is already <unk> by water .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> was <unk> with a team <unk> last <unk> last <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! Al <unk> : She &apos;s OK . The question is if you do it .
One reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the north .
This is a river in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> never <unk> like that .
This is the <unk> river <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how you go up the sea level to the <unk> of the sea <unk> on <unk> , here &apos;s where the sea is .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
On the other side of the planet : <unk> , the largest ice <unk> of the planet .
<unk> month , scientists have <unk> that the ice <unk> is in <unk> , and that the Western <unk> , who <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> feet <unk> , like in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the third largest <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , who few years ago were <unk> .
<unk> percent of the world population <unk> <unk> water from that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : this <unk> is the source of <unk> water in this city .
The <unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same thing happens to water .
In California <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> of 40 percent .
<unk> <unk> are in crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they &apos;re <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> in the world leads to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a normal <unk> out of the normal and without <unk> .
<unk> times over <unk> in the last 30 years , <unk> than the <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the whole <unk> .
If you look at it in the <unk> context , you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we have <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every day -- 25 million <unk> in the oceans every day .
Look at <unk> the area of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , to <unk> , and on both of the <unk> <unk> , where there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> oxygen in the oceans .
The greater cause of the global warming , together to the <unk> , which is the <unk> use of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of two countries with most emissions , <unk> to China .
And you can build a lot of other <unk> <unk> .
But we &apos;re going to be a <unk> of direction .
These are the <unk> projects over the last few years and some <unk> of <unk> .
So , there &apos;s a political <unk> in our country .
The <unk> of <unk> and oil have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to have a little bit of a --
<unk> <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it on the <unk> .
This is the second largest flow in America .
It &apos;s been successful around <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> the <unk> is a <unk> guy .
It &apos;s <unk> here in America , and it &apos;s <unk> our economy .
<unk> <unk> is more <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Al <unk> : <unk> , you get a big <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
The biggest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al <unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , one part of them .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> , we see the <unk> change as a <unk> <unk> in our business .
So , we have a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to public and <unk> the truth about <unk> .
Actually , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it &apos;s <unk> -- it &apos;s got a good <unk> .
So , we don &apos;t talk about climate change .
We want to do that .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you &apos;ve heard about it a lot of it .
So , you &apos;re going to <unk> a <unk> structure for the <unk> of what the <unk> is about <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> machines are a little <unk> , but this is the sound of <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> is between the <unk> of global warming , but the <unk> technology of <unk> that you see is changing everything .
You have a look at : this is the <unk> <unk> technology .
Al <unk> : <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic question and the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> America is in crisis ; America &apos;s the economy , the national security crisis .
The <unk> that all the <unk> that all of us from <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and oil <unk> .
Now , though , there &apos;s a new way , <unk> solution .
<unk> America : 100 percent <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan to <unk> America at work , <unk> more <unk> , and help <unk> the global <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we &apos;re going to solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
Al <unk> : This is the last .
<unk> : This is a <unk> of energy to America .
One of the more <unk> ways to <unk> the <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , a new <unk> network .
<unk> <unk> 2 : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for jobs .
<unk> : <unk> America . It &apos;s time to be <unk> .
Al <unk> : A <unk> <unk> <unk> says , &quot; If you want to go to the <unk> , you go alone .
If you want to go out , you go out , you go . &quot;
We have to go very quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year I made a <unk> on <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to try to <unk> on how the machine works .
So here we go . And for those who else time didn &apos;t , the <unk> is the largest experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
<unk> is to <unk> the conditions that were present less than a <unk> of the universe -- to <unk> million times a second .
All of this is simply <unk> .
This is the <unk> machine .
<unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk> .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called <unk> -- is <unk> <unk> feet .
This is a <unk> picture of <unk> in building , so you can see the <unk> .
<unk> 10 <unk> last year we <unk> the car for the first time .
And this photograph was taken by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in control room .
It &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> <unk> particles that had done all the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles inside the <unk> .
In other words , when I <unk> that image the <unk> 10 , you &apos;ll find that the <unk> machine , which is a great <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if this is to make us <unk> , or this , when somebody <unk> on Google , and I would say , the <unk> page was this .
That means we have had a <unk> impact on that scientific .
And I spent a week later , there was a problem with the car , had to just these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> of <unk> .
Now , the <unk> of you <unk> <unk> and <unk> , &quot; It &apos;s not true . I &apos;m <unk> too <unk> . &quot;
And they can do that because when they &apos;re very <unk> to become the <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees , at a temperature <unk> to that of the space between stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> of <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and that are <unk> of about 30 <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we then do .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
Now they &apos;re <unk> now all the way to their <unk> place .
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> is going to be new <unk> .
I <unk> it , and we &apos;ll try to get <unk> data or <unk> , and continue like this <unk> to find out what are the <unk> that we would <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> on the value of science and engineering <unk> engineering . It &apos;s easy to <unk> .
I think that the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact , the fact that I think is the value of things like <unk> .
I want to end with a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who , in <unk> <unk> of <unk> experiments in <unk> <unk> with his <unk> , his <unk> was <unk> , and his <unk> <unk> Michael <unk> , said , &quot; No , no one is <unk> for the progress of the human mind how the ideas of science are <unk> , that there are <unk> , and that we have new <unk> <unk> of <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> <unk> at when , from children , <unk> with <unk> .
<unk> <unk> like <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , actually thinking and <unk> <unk> problems .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way most of the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with objects , with my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started to <unk> : &quot; And if , when we use a computer , instead of having the only <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> with both hands ,
and we &apos;re going to <unk> our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that we wanted to go to explore the answer , building <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , they can <unk> with their own , hear their movement and they have a screen and they have a radio <unk> .
But <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> it .
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> <unk> to <unk> the digital information .
And as they become more <unk> , they get <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , the other , as they get <unk> , they get <unk> , <unk> of their own movement , to be able to explore new <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , I &apos;ll start with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you about the video of video : if you <unk> it in one direction , the <unk> video , so if you could <unk> the other side back .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of other people .
If you <unk> them , you start them , you &apos;re going to see what it &apos;s going around them .
If they get <unk> , they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
If they get <unk> , they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We were to realize that one of the interesting <unk> was the <unk> of the <unk> was the <unk> that we could use common on data , like it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk> and I can <unk> it to <unk> the color of the color in that central , where you <unk> .
and I can <unk> for color <unk> in that central to the central color , where you <unk> .
If you get too much , we can <unk> a little bit .
I &apos;m also <unk> possibilities to <unk> , like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , where people can try things very quickly , and <unk> the results immediately .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a <unk> sequence I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a game of words that &apos;s <unk> half between <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> , you could <unk> a letter on every <unk> , <unk> , at every <unk> , and every <unk> <unk> a letter , in <unk> words , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds <unk> , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try to do it .
Thank you .
Here are kids <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> , I did the <unk> <unk> , and I <unk> them up , and I <unk> a video .
They &apos;re very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things like this <unk> is that you have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just say , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , right there .
In fact , he wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to build a tool for the <unk> of <unk> . He &apos;s <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now he took a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> work ! Yeah !
So , you know , <unk> <unk> and <unk> can make the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
-- I &apos;m going to <unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It &apos;s a final story that &apos;s open with open , and it can decide what you &apos;re going to be able to decide what you &apos;re going to be .
<unk> : It &apos;s a final story that &apos;s open with open , and it can decide what you &apos;re going to be able to decide what you &apos;re going to be .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time to show you is a tool that we did have a <unk> that was made to <unk> and <unk> music .
It &apos;s a tool that we did recently , to <unk> music .
<unk> <unk> here , <unk> <unk> as basic <unk> , and <unk> .
<unk> of these has four different <unk> , and you can choose which to use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of <unk> to your <unk> .
And I just <unk> by doing a <unk> , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
These are actually <unk> you can control live , like <unk> and <unk> .
I &apos;ll <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are the <unk> effects of time and <unk> , who <unk> the whole sequence .
<unk> how it works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> in a series , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m going to take a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> : Now let &apos;s <unk> <unk> --
<unk> : And now , I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> , so I can control the effect of live .
<unk> : I can <unk> the entire sequence of time <unk> the entire sequence time on one side or another .
<unk> : And now you get the <unk> <unk> down to the bottom to give <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the sequence &quot; flight . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> it , <unk> or more <unk> .
And now , I finally , I can <unk> the entire sequence on the left the <unk> &quot; <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain works and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to <unk> is that it &apos;s <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> with media , which <unk> information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time I &apos;m going to talk to you all .
I &apos;m a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and love <unk> .
And it &apos;s not what it looks like .
But , I said this , something particular happened in my life and in my life , which led me to <unk> the whole relationship to this work .
The particular thing is I <unk> wrote this book , this <unk> called &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which , I <unk> , &quot; which , I <unk> , for some reason , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere I <unk> , people will <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> !
I &apos;m going to get all <unk> and say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear that you have to be able to do better ?
You don &apos;t fear to keep writing all of life without being able to create a book that can <unk> somebody ? &quot;
How can you get somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , except I remember that over 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to be able to <unk> the same <unk> <unk> .
And people say , &quot; Don &apos;t you try to <unk> &apos;t be able to have success ?
Can you have no fear that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> you ?
You don &apos;t fear of doing this <unk> for all life without any of life , you &apos;ve never come out and die on a <unk> of <unk> dreams with the mouth of <unk> <unk> ?
So , you know .
The short answer all of these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I fear of all those things .
I &apos;ve always been afraid .
And I also <unk> of a lot of other things that people can &apos;t <unk> .
Like the <unk> and other things that are <unk> .
But , as far as I was , I &apos;m going to tell you about it , it &apos;s why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It &apos;s <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel to do .
But what &apos;s so particular about the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not ?
How my dad , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I don &apos;t remember one time in his <unk> years of the <unk> that he was asked if he was <unk> <unk> ?
There was never -- that <unk> of <unk> John , how did it go ?
Don &apos;t you do that , you know ?
<unk> , the engineers like a group of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
We have enough , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> but <unk> , we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
And there &apos;s no other than looking at the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often <unk> them .
And the ones who don &apos;t seem to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before I die , in the last <unk> said , &quot; Every my book me <unk> a little bit more , &quot; A <unk> <unk> about the work of their life .
But we don &apos;t know when I say that , because we &apos;ve heard these things so long , we have completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and creativity <unk> that creativity and <unk> , at the end , <unk> , you always <unk> to the <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> you all over here today is : <unk> with this idea ?
You &apos;re OK , this thing -- because even <unk> by a <unk> distance to me not that .
I think it &apos;s <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s also <unk> and I don &apos;t want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better <unk> our <unk> <unk> to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- in my <unk> , it would be very <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> that I &apos;m in my career .
<unk> -- look , I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;m quite young , I have about 40 years .
I &apos;ve got about four <unk> of work in me .
And it &apos;s very <unk> that whatever <unk> <unk> in the world , as the work that I <unk> after my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we &apos;re all about friends here -- is <unk> that the biggest my biggest success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
You know , this is the kind of thought that leads to person to start to <unk> <unk> at nine <unk> in the morning , and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I want to continue doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so I think , after many <unk> , that the way to work to keep the write is to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to have a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , which I &apos;m <unk> , and my natural <unk> on which the <unk> <unk> <unk> . And as I &apos;m going to <unk> for all last year , trying to find other societies on how to do it <unk> looking through time , trying to find other society to see whether you have better ideas and more <unk> ideas .
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research led me to the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re going to be <unk> and then they go back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> -- people don &apos;t believe that creativity <unk> from men , OK ?
It turns out that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> to men in a <unk> and <unk> , for reasons <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity <unk> <unk> of creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from far .
The <unk> were the same idea , but they were <unk> that kind of spirit without a <unk> body .
That &apos;s <unk> , because the <unk> don &apos;t really understand that a <unk> was particularly <unk> .
And we thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> literally in the <unk> of the study of a <unk> artist , a little artist like the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> out to <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the <unk> of that work .
<unk> <unk> , that &apos;s the distance I talk about -- that <unk> you from the results of your work .
And everyone thought that was so that we <unk> , right ?
So the artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like the way too <unk> , right ?
If your work was <unk> not <unk> , you &apos;re all <unk> that you have been <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , you know , it &apos;s not your <unk> , right ?
Everybody thought it was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
And then the <unk> <unk> and everything , and we <unk> this great idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe , and the <unk> and no longer to let &apos;s <unk> creatures that <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people started to think that creativity was completely from the <unk> .
And for the first time in history , you start to <unk> this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> person with the <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think that was a big <unk> .
I think that &apos;s going to be able to believe someone , a simple person to believe that they <unk> and <unk> all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> is a responsibility to believe that it &apos;s a <unk> too big to give to human <unk> .
It &apos;s like to ask for somebody to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and completely <unk> the <unk> and creates all of these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s been this pressure to have <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years .
And if that &apos;s true , and I think that &apos;s true , the question becomes , and now
Can we do it <unk> ?
They want to go back to a <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t do it about 500 years of thinking about a 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of , <unk> , you <unk> , you <unk> people <unk> to <unk> their projects .
You probably don &apos;t all know you &apos;re going to be able to do this .
But the question I want to tell you about is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t we <unk> this way ?
Because it has more sense of everything that I &apos;ve heard to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process .
A process that , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so , basically , everyone here -- you know , you don &apos;t <unk> .
And , in fact , it can sometimes look completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , who has now 90 years , but who was a <unk> <unk> for the entire life and said that during his <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the fields , <unk> out in the fields , and I <unk> it , and I <unk> it , in the <unk> , when a <unk> <unk> .
He said , he was like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And she <unk> to her <unk> .
I <unk> it to get , because it <unk> the land under his feet .
I decided to have one thing to do at that point and it was , words , &quot; <unk> like a <unk> . &quot;
And so we went back to home and came from this <unk> , and he would have not had anything to take a piece of paper and a <unk> <unk> enough to the page .
Sometimes I don &apos;t have enough to be <unk> enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without able to get it home and I <unk> her <unk> , and she would <unk> them up through the <unk> , looking at how she said , &quot; another <unk> . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this piece never -- there were times when the piece of <unk> , right ?
So , he was coming back at home and he was trying to <unk> the <unk> through , and I had a <unk> right in the while he was <unk> , and then he said , that was like , if you <unk> with the other hand and the <unk> .
I <unk> the tail off and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the page <unk> and <unk> , but in the <unk> , the last word on the first one .
So when I <unk> it -- it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not all my <unk> process -- I &apos;m not a <unk> .
I &apos;m a <unk> , and my way to <unk> is ; I <unk> at the same <unk> every day and work and <unk> and work and <unk> <unk> over <unk> .
But even I have <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I would say that many of you have to do it .
You know , even though the work and ideas <unk> me <unk> by a certain source I can &apos;t <unk> <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> to it in a way to do not <unk> the head , but , what does it <unk> us to do you ?
So , as I &apos;m <unk> , the best example of the <unk> that I have <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I <unk> different years ago for a <unk> .
I was talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the artist <unk> <unk> , trying to control , <unk> , <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then I <unk> , he <unk> , and one day as he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , <unk> it all for him .
<unk> <unk> , and all of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> , who comes in his head like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the <unk> , but it doesn &apos;t know how to <unk> it .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it &apos;s not a <unk> , it has a <unk> .
So he starts to hear this kind of old <unk> <unk> on him , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose it , and I &apos;m going to be <unk> by this song .
I &apos;m not <unk> enough , and I can &apos;t <unk> . &quot;
And instead of going to the <unk> , you know , you &apos;re going to go to the <unk> , you know .
<unk> the whole process and made something completely new .
I just wanted the sky and said , &quot; <unk> , do you see that I &apos;m <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Do you feel that it can write a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you know , you &apos;re going to take care of you .
<unk> , I started to <unk> another one .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And his process <unk> <unk> after this .
It wasn &apos;t work , it was the work was still <unk> as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when the <unk> , the <unk> that outside him <unk> , the <unk> that he <unk> <unk> , and I <unk> it back to where it was , you know , it wasn &apos;t going to be <unk> and <unk> .
but I <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> <unk> a conversation with this <unk> thing and <unk> it , but it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
So how much I &apos;m going to have that story to change a little bit , even the way I &apos;m going to talk about it .
This idea , I &apos;m going to be when I was <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; and I <unk> in one of those <unk> <unk> in which we &apos;re all working in something and we can &apos;t , and you start to think it &apos;s going to be a <unk> , which is going to be the book .
Not only <unk> , just the book written about it .
And we started thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I &apos;m going to <unk> that <unk> to air and I &apos;m going to go .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and I <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> corner of the room .
And I said , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , what , you know , you know that if this book is not going to be <unk> my , right ?
Because as I see , I &apos;m going to <unk> all I have , I have no more than this .
So if you want it to be better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , I don &apos;t do it .
I started writing the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I want to please be that I &apos;m <unk> today to do my <unk> . &quot; Because at the end of the <unk> Africa , the <unk> of the North Africa , people will <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> music , and they will be <unk> for hours to <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every once in a <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these artists actually <unk> .
And I know you know what I talk about , because I know you &apos;ve got all seen , at a certain point , a <unk> .
It was like time , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it wasn &apos;t doing anything different from the usually , like the <unk> <unk> before , but all <unk> .
And suddenly , not just as a human just .
But it <unk> up from <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people would <unk> what was , the <unk> of his name .
I <unk> my hands and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; to &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which is , you can hear in <unk> or in <unk> .
In <unk> , when a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it &apos;s <unk> because we need it .
But the problem comes the next day , to the <unk> itself , when you go and <unk> that are 11 <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> God &apos;s <unk> and <unk> God &apos;s no longer .
It &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and maybe never <unk> to <unk> that <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God , while I &apos;m going to go , and what does with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so <unk> if you can &apos;t believe , <unk> , <unk> , that the most <unk> <unk> of your being come from you .
But let &apos;s just show you that you data in <unk> by a <unk> source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to the other when you &apos;re finished .
And , you know , if you think this way all changes .
And so I started <unk> , and it &apos;s certainly how I <unk> it for several months in the book that I was <unk> early ,
And what I have to keep <unk> when I feel <unk> by this is , not fear .
Don &apos;t just give it . You just your work .
You &apos;re going to <unk> for your <unk> , whatever it can be .
If you &apos;re <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> .
If the <unk> , you &apos;ll be <unk> <unk> to you <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for a moment in your <unk> , then you know , &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
You know , you do the same <unk> .
And &quot; <unk> ! &quot; <unk> . &quot;
I think , and I think , you know , you know , you know ,
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; <unk> &quot; to you the same , even for <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> : <unk> !
As you know I &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what &apos;s going to <unk> and discovery of new genes of <unk> .
Now we &apos;re going to <unk> a new process : we started to <unk> biology and now starting to <unk> the biology and we &apos;re going to start with that code in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We &apos;ve always been trying to get big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; is something that many <unk> I think have <unk> to understand various levels .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> <unk> to the <unk> terms .
We &apos;re <unk> from almost 20 years now .
When we have <unk> the human genome is <unk> to go out of the world <unk> of the computer in the digital world .
Now , can we <unk> the life , or create new life on the <unk> universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species of the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> a even smaller one .
We can <unk> a <unk> of genes <unk> about 500 are here .
But when we take a look at his <unk> map , it &apos;s simple than our .
So , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at a time , it &apos;s very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell .
So we thought the only way to <unk> this <unk> in a way to <unk> this <unk> in a way to <unk> some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of &quot; Can we <unk> a <unk> ? &quot;
Can the chemistry <unk> to produce these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And in case , can we make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> material .
The speed with which we &apos;re able to <unk> the life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , <unk> rather slowly , but it &apos;s <unk> .
And our most <unk> results <unk> on a <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve been <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before they <unk> the experiments .
But we found that <unk> DNA <unk> is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that we have little <unk> of DNA <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> process : the more <unk> is a process : the more <unk> is , the more <unk> is there .
So we had to develop a new way to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , <unk> information about the <unk> genome .
It &apos;s a little virus that <unk> bacteria .
We designed <unk> <unk> , we <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of about <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we have taken this piece of <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> it in bacteria , and they <unk> it in bacteria , and they <unk> the <unk> particles .
<unk> particles have been then <unk> by the cells , they <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ve talked about recently members with the <unk> industry that they &apos;ve been <unk> this model .
They have more than you .
And we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we had to do the bigger things .
You had to build the entire <unk> of <unk> .
They are more than <unk> <unk> <unk> of code .
So we &apos;ve been thinking about <unk> in the size of the virus , so we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> are the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
The <unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> information in a computer , these must be very <unk> .
When I was <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> , the standard <unk> was a <unk> <unk> for every 10 <unk> .
We found , we had 30 , 30 <unk> . If you could use that <unk> sequence never been able to do it .
A part of the process is designing <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> with all the other <unk> <unk> <unk> to build smaller <unk> that <unk> <unk> together .
You have to be <unk> here .
You &apos;ve probably read that you &apos;ve probably read that you in the <unk> .
So let &apos;s go on four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , about 20 <unk> , and there &apos;s a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk> .
So we can use the code for writing , <unk> , <unk> .
So what we did we did at the beginning of this .
Some have been <unk> by the fact that it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that we <unk> them and <unk> <unk> .
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> we have produced these <unk> <unk> in <unk> so that we &apos;re <unk> to create a very <unk> <unk> , as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to <unk> the process .
So , this seems a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When I get these <unk> <unk> , the more than 100 <unk> <unk> , you can &apos;t get <unk> directly to the <unk> <unk> .
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> biology .
So we have <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA that we can <unk> the <unk> .
Here &apos;s an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , it can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> like his <unk> <unk> .
In 12 hours , it &apos;s <unk> exactly like it was before .
<unk> of thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely <unk> .
You have to live under <unk> .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and they &apos;re going to find new <unk> <unk> of water .
Actually , NASA has shown this happens .
This is a picture of the <unk> we built using these <unk> , just using the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we did a little bit of time ago .
They are more than <unk> <unk> of code .
It &apos;s the largest <unk> structure that has ever been <unk> by man .
It has a <unk> weight <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a 10 <unk> without spaces , you &apos;ll just <unk> pages to <unk> this genetic code .
Now , how do we make it work ? How can we <unk> it ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> is a <unk> game .
It &apos;s a little bit more <unk> when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s more simple even when it &apos;s about <unk> cells like that : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the process of <unk> .
In <unk> , the <unk> is instead of <unk> <unk> in the cell , but we have <unk> <unk> that we can do a <unk> <unk> of a cell <unk> by a cell to another and of <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> by a <unk> species .
The two different are how men from the <unk> .
We have <unk> some <unk> in a way we can decide which choice for this <unk> .
He then <unk> it with the <unk> so that they <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell , and we <unk> our <unk> <unk> <unk> the new <unk> went into the cell .
And we had to <unk> that we don &apos;t have to go beyond , but we tried to <unk> more in there .
This is one of the biggest <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere , we had a second <unk> to a thousand new <unk> to that species .
So who thinks evolution as a <unk> <unk> , it doesn &apos;t have much of biology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell , they didn &apos;t <unk> one .
The <unk> <unk> we have <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s got the other <unk> as <unk> material , he <unk> it , and we <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk> .
has become blue because of the genes we have <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all of the <unk> , all of the <unk> species have gone , and it &apos;s <unk> all in a new species , <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code that you have <unk> .
Now , this may be <unk> <unk> , but we &apos;ll <unk> the software DNA , we can change things in a way that &apos;s <unk> enough .
Now , I &apos;ve already <unk> that you &apos;re not talking about <unk> -- but <unk> progress from three million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re going to create new <unk> version of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where we &apos;re going to create new species on this process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> when we think our <unk> .
We &apos;re going to go for six billion people and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give an example : I was born in <unk> .
Now , there are three people on the planet to get <unk> in <unk> ; it &apos;s going to be four .
We &apos;re <unk> now to find food , water <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> for six billion people .
We &apos;re even more <unk> to do it for nine billion .
We &apos;re over five billion <unk> , over 30 billion <unk> , over 30 billion <unk> .
That means percent of <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or whatever process of <unk> , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
In the more we have to realize that all the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
So , I think of the today , because of the <unk> <unk> all over the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that &apos;s <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> <unk> only <unk> a <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from reality and our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , thank you very much for these <unk> <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think of these 20 million genes of different genes or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology that we can change in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> or chemistry , production of <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we &apos;re working on to be able to <unk> and design species at the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how to be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
Now we &apos;re going to be <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
You saw <unk> you that <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We have <unk> <unk> and third generation that we &apos;ll be <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way biology can have a very large impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> CO2 in matter before , so we &apos;re working on designing cells that purpose , and we think we can have the first <unk> of <unk> in 18 months .
<unk> solar <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> , we have found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> we <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> in the deep ocean , at about <unk> feet deep to the temperature of water .
<unk> <unk> by the CO2 using hydrogen as we &apos;re using hydrogen <unk> as energy .
We &apos;re trying to figure out if we can <unk> CO2 , that can easily be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , we <unk> think we might be able to <unk> what the basic question , &quot; which is life is , &quot; We have the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole <unk> of <unk> the whole <unk> .
<unk> . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t do it from TED , you can &apos;t do it from TED , you know . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , you know ?
We have a <unk> <unk> power .
<unk> , we &apos;re working on the same <unk> to use the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk> .
You saw this year with the flu , we always <unk> a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s <unk> .
I think that you can change <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And this is how the future could start to look <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and finally <unk> cells .
We have to so much better people .
Our purpose is to do in a way to live long enough to try to <unk> them . Thank you very much .
First of all , I &apos;m going to show you , the <unk> , some fundamental work , the new technology we took to the <unk> <unk> at a <unk> <unk> almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
It &apos;s a environment where you can <unk> be at local level that you can <unk> is <unk> with a huge amount of <unk> data .
So here we &apos;re seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a fast <unk> , <unk> the images like .
And no matter how much the amount of information that we see , how big it is that big <unk> of data or <unk> .
Most of the <unk> photographs , but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> , and they <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It &apos;s not any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen . It &apos;s also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a book , which is not about images .
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
To <unk> that it &apos;s just the <unk> and not of images , we can do something like this , to actually see that it &apos;s a real <unk> <unk> , not a picture .
It could be a little bit <unk> to read a <unk> book .
I don &apos;t <unk> it .
This is a more <unk> example . This is a number of The <unk> .
Every image of the <unk> is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience to read the real version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is a <unk> of a <unk> , which is for nature .
We also have done something with the <unk> of this particular number of The <unk> .
We &apos;ve created a lot higher <unk> <unk> than the one that you can use in a normal <unk> , and we &apos;ve <unk> to you <unk> content .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see it here .
Or even models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
We think this is going to put the <unk> and other <unk> , not to be <unk> .
Of course , <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on that I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say we have <unk> <unk> to give in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> over a NASA <unk> .
So now I &apos;m going to try to do this .
This is actually live on the Web ; you can see it .
This is a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a very interesting <unk> <unk> computer , a very interesting <unk> student , a student at the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s live on the Web , <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from a picture to another and have this kind of experience <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of images here actually has meaning .
The <unk> <unk> of the computer <unk> have these images together , so that we <unk> to the <unk> places that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk> . Here we see the elements of a <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s what you see is the elements of a <unk> or <unk> , and these things have been all been <unk> <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to go right to one of the <unk> data , and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> that we did work for the first summer , to show you what &apos;s going to happen to be really the key to this technology , the <unk> technology behind this technology , <unk> technology . And it &apos;s not <unk> , you look at the <unk> that we put in the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> <unk> and so forth .
This is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> images of <unk> , and <unk> images of <unk> , other <unk> and so forth . <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> a picture that has been discovered in this model .
So they &apos;re all <unk> images and have been all <unk> up at the <unk> level this way .
And you can <unk> this way .
You know , I never thought I &apos;d ever thought I &apos;d be working for <unk> .
It &apos;s very <unk> to <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think you &apos;ll see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of <unk> : that &apos;s cell phone in this environment .
And if I can , I can , I get those <unk> .
Many are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
So , some part here is a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go to the <unk> to the physics of this environment .
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now <unk> data from the whole <unk> memory of how we <unk> the earth , from the whole <unk> of how we <unk> the earth , from the <unk> <unk> and <unk> all that data .
All those pictures become <unk> together , greater than the <unk> of the parts .
You have a model of the land that you <unk> .
Think of this as a <unk> of the <unk> work on Earth .
It &apos;s something that <unk> in complexity , as people will <unk> , and the <unk> for the people who are <unk> it with the use of .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people .
If somebody comes the idea of <unk> all of these <unk> <unk> the name , my <unk> <unk> <unk> , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to use that <unk> <unk> to <unk> in that space , in that <unk> , in that <unk> , using the pictures of anyone else , and having a <unk> social <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all of this are interesting <unk> models of every part interesting about the land , <unk> not only by <unk> <unk> and <unk> images and similar , but from the <unk> .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized what your software is it going to <unk> us to do is that at a point , in the next few years , all the pictures <unk> from anybody in the entire world , are going to be <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is we &apos;re going to discover .
It &apos;s creating <unk> , if you want , in the images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the <unk> of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> information that a lot of these <unk> images .
As you get a research <unk> on images , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the page , you get a <unk> and the text on the page ,
Now , what happens if that picture you <unk> all your pictures ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and <unk> that <unk> is really huge . It &apos;s a very huge effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it &apos;s really incredible . <unk> .
<unk> : I &apos;m going to give you a lot .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is the way to live between who has no <unk> <unk> , between who <unk> the wind , the <unk> it in the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , <unk> it in the <unk> <unk> of plants .
You think that <unk> <unk> will be <unk> even beyond the <unk> <unk> , or that the <unk> of <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , or that in <unk> , the <unk> still <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , to remember the <unk> of the <unk> , and that the idea that the world that we live in there is no <unk> , but it &apos;s only a model , but it &apos;s just a model , but it &apos;s only a reality of reality ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , well , a lot of <unk> choices .
And , of course , all of the <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . Everybody <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> to <unk> .
We have to deal with the <unk> of death , so we don &apos;t feel whether it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> --
We all have an art .
What <unk> is the particular <unk> of the song , the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter whether the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of <unk> .
He was my <unk> of the journey in the <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> of <unk> in <unk> <unk> , the mother <unk> &apos;s mother &apos;s <unk> .
All these <unk> are <unk> that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And if you <unk> a second , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of the world create a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and <unk> that <unk> the planet , as the <unk> <unk> known as <unk> as <unk> .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the total <unk> of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , ideas , <unk> , <unk> , ideas , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being from being the human <unk> .
The <unk> is the <unk> <unk> of humanity .
It &apos;s the <unk> of what we can be , and what we can be in as a kind of <unk> .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all species have been or on the <unk> of <unk> , because it &apos;s <unk> , or -- in the <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> more <unk> -- the <unk> of diversity -- and not even <unk> <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> diversity .
The <unk> of this is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just <unk> by a <unk> or a series of rules .
One language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle with the <unk> that the culture of every culture comes in the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a <unk> , a thought , a <unk> of <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we &apos;re sitting here at <unk> , at least half not <unk> in the <unk> of children .
They &apos;re not <unk> to kids , the who means that they &apos;re already <unk> not <unk> something , which are already <unk> .
What is more <unk> than the <unk> of being <unk> by the <unk> , of the last few to talk about a language , of not having a <unk> <unk> <unk> or to <unk> the <unk> of the children ?
This <unk> <unk> was the <unk> of someone in the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> , and he &apos;s <unk> with it in the <unk> , the <unk> of a language <unk> .
And I know anybody who &apos;s <unk> , &quot; <unk> &apos;t that better ?
The world would not be a better place if we all the same language ? &quot; <unk> , then we all talk about it . <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> a <unk> thing that means not to talk about your language .
I &apos;d like to give you a journey today to do a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we &apos;re <unk> .
Many of us believe that when I say &quot; different ways of <unk> &quot; I mean different ways of <unk> .
So , for example , this <unk> <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , who <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> that you can &apos;t <unk> the blue color in the green one because the time <unk> is <unk> in the forest , which we <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> a person talking about a language .
Everything has <unk> in the <unk> past <unk> , though the <unk> is that in these <unk> where you talk are or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> nobody basically <unk> .
You can listen and listen to the <unk> .
I had one of the most interesting <unk> with which I lived in , the <unk> of <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
They did <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , who was this <unk> of the <unk> forest had never seen anything .
They <unk> the <unk> pictures , they <unk> the <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> their <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> them up , they <unk> that <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with the <unk> .
But <unk> don &apos;t just <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> with them .
<unk> percent <unk> <unk> were <unk> by themselves .
We went to eight <unk> and we found two cases of death and when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was so much dead , and then they <unk> it . And then they <unk> it . And then they <unk> it .
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> for 40 <unk> and to <unk> the species .
<unk> years &apos; <unk> , &apos; <unk> , I was a really interesting task when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> between the <unk> society and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to do the <unk> .
To make sense of <unk> , I should have to understand the <unk> culture , and the <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a rather than a <unk> <unk> view of the world .
Very interesting .
If you &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the world , what would you like ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent has always left out , thinking that <unk> Africa has no <unk> . And instead , and the <unk> is another one of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes interesting about <unk> is the <unk> of the relationship between life and death .
So <unk> do <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> in a short <unk> becomes the <unk> .
And that &apos;s what the <unk> <unk> say , &quot; <unk> go to the <unk> to talk of God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . &quot;
And what you &apos;re <unk> , is the spirit that you <unk> , how can you get <unk> of evil ?
So , you start these incredible events : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather strong <unk> of the power of mind at the time when it &apos;s <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> that I lived with the most <unk> are the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> civilization that once we <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> has never been <unk> by <unk> .
And in today I &apos;m <unk> by a <unk> , but their education is extraordinary <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> by <unk> <unk> , and they live in a world that &apos;s made of <unk> and <unk> in a world that was <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to 18 years .
Two <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
For that time , they &apos;re <unk> to values about their society , values that they <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or just their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> .
So , at the end of this incredible <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> out and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 , they see a <unk> . And in that moment of <unk> &apos;s <unk> , all of all that have learned in theory is <unk> in all of that have learned in theory is <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> back and says :
&quot; <unk> ? <unk> as I said .
It &apos;s <unk> . Now it &apos;s a <unk> .
They call the big <unk> and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think about the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the old story of <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> concept in its <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are closer to the Earth .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by <unk> .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , but <unk> at the time and the <unk> , have created a <unk> of the Earth , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> : the concept that the Earth can only live because the concept is , the concept that the Earth can only live in because it &apos;s <unk> from human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
I mean , a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> spirit that <unk> its <unk> will be a <unk> different relationship with the mountain or that mountain , or that place to a <unk> of <unk> that mountain or place to be <unk> .
whether it &apos;s a <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
And that made me a human being different from my <unk> friends who believe that <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> who live in the <unk> world , <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> .
If you start to <unk> that these <unk> can create different , we start to understand some of them <unk> <unk> . <unk> this <unk> .
I <unk> this picture at <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
What makes fascinating is that the <unk> <unk> is not the potential for the <unk> of the <unk> , but his <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> from two elements .
On one side , this <unk> <unk> that <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> <unk> a little bit , which <unk> a little bit , but it &apos;s <unk> with a <unk> of a <unk> family said <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you &apos;re going to see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> that make a different kind of <unk> , it <unk> it .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . &#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; . It creates the <unk> of reality .
I often talk to my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of the <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> my <unk> , you can &apos;t <unk> these <unk> as a <unk> , because if you did not tell anybody who &apos;s <unk> . <unk> <unk> can &apos;t be <unk> because they &apos;re <unk> by a <unk> that is , of course , in <unk> , <unk> .
It &apos;s possible to <unk> <unk> if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now , this is the beautiful : the <unk> that are <unk> in this <unk> are <unk> , the same kind of <unk> <unk> . The question <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> species , like these <unk> <unk> <unk> , like these <unk> <unk> two <unk> don &apos;t similar , but that if you <unk> it in this way , they create a <unk> version that &apos;s <unk> <unk> at the top of the parts ?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> .
But if you <unk> to the <unk> , we &apos;re going to be &quot; The plants are talking . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , who <unk> <unk> in the forest , and our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If you <unk> it as you <unk> their <unk> , you know , you &apos;re going to <unk> it , you know ? &quot; I said , &quot; &quot;
The solution is : you take the <unk> <unk> in a <unk> of the moon and <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
And that &apos;s not really interesting with this , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , &#91; <unk> &#93; the problem is that even those of us who have the heart <unk> <unk> <unk> them , but somehow <unk> to the history of history of our real world , and it <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk> , but rather like the one was where we were <unk> and we <unk> <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of mass <unk> of <unk> diversity and <unk> . Now the problem is not the change .
All the <unk> were <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> don &apos;t have <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> and they <unk> , and they <unk> like <unk> don &apos;t have <unk> to be <unk> when they put on the <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It &apos;s the power .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you look at a look at the world , you &apos;ll see that these are not <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of the existence of <unk> forces that are beyond their <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> , a <unk> who lived in the forest <unk> to a generation ago , and now <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> , where you can see the river <unk> , where you can see the river <unk> , it seems to be <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in case of <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> .
If we <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the <unk> <unk> of the political <unk> .
And like <unk> <unk> , the <unk> physics of a <unk> , is <unk> at the <unk> level , but the <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> &apos;s <unk> , not only is it , but it &apos;s <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it &apos;s part of the development of the development .
And you can &apos;t understand the <unk> of <unk> until you go to the <unk> .
I <unk> miles <unk> in China in the <unk> <unk> , in <unk> , <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> , I &apos;ve only got to see what there is behind the <unk> that I &apos;m going to talk about .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> at the <unk> <unk> .
That means that it &apos;s been <unk> at the time of the Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk> .
It was brought to <unk> in <unk> at the age of two <unk> under his <unk> , because he could not have been .
The <unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> .
One day he <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to work for seven years .
The pain of <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of <unk> is by <unk> .
<unk> , all of that , all <unk> to a choice .
Would you like to live in the world <unk> or we want to <unk> the world <unk> of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died said that his greatest fear was that , in our way to go to this <unk> vision of the world , not only <unk> the entire <unk> of human imagination at a <unk> <unk> of thinking , but one day we <unk> us by a <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it &apos;s <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , who has given us <unk> , who made us <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , and we &apos;re talking about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has to <unk> 300 years .
The <unk> story I didn &apos;t believe that we have the answers to all the challenges that we <unk> in the <unk> to come .
When at these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> <unk> different .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all <unk> the possibilities of being what we are : a <unk> species , which has to make sure that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are big moments of <unk> moments .
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> island , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> , and this man , <unk> me , he <unk> the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The <unk> government wasn &apos;t always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> .
The family , <unk> for his life , the <unk> <unk> all the <unk> , and all of his <unk> .
You have to know that <unk> don &apos;t get the cold , you &apos;ll see it .
The <unk> <unk> were made of fish <unk> in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn &apos;t <unk> at night or <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> out , it &apos;s <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did <unk> them , he <unk> them by , he <unk> them by it <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk> , he &apos;s <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> has created a <unk> , he <unk> another dog , and he &apos;s <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> you have to talk about <unk> ? &#91; <unk> &#93; And this , in different ways , &#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s their new <unk> . It &apos;s called <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s all the <unk> resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s quite <unk> at least to the people who have been in these <unk> <unk> , <unk> that are not at all <unk> .
And so somebody &apos;s home .
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> at the time . And for us all , the dreams of these children , they become part of our children , they become part of the <unk> <unk> of hope .
To end , we &apos;re going to <unk> <unk> we are <unk> that <unk> never .
<unk> that <unk> --
&#91; <unk> &#93; are not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our site . Every month our site <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public in places to <unk> our public in places to <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> time for the central <unk> : the world &apos;s <unk> of <unk> : the world &apos;s <unk> to <unk> diversity , and we have to find a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in a <unk> world . And <unk> , we have to find a <unk> world , and we have to find a <unk> <unk> world
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I &apos;ve written in this book that I hope you &apos;ve heard and <unk> some <unk> , in case , you don &apos;t know .
I want to start with what I call the <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> <unk> : &quot; If we want to <unk> <unk> <unk> of our citizens , &quot; The way to do it is to <unk> freedom . &quot;
The reason is , on one side , in the fact that freedom is itself a value , is <unk> , useful for human beings .
And the other is that if we &apos;re <unk> , each of us can do anything that <unk> our <unk> , without any <unk> in the name .
The way to <unk> freedom is to <unk> the choice .
More choices choices choices , and more <unk> , is their <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , the bigger than the <unk> .
This , <unk> , it &apos;s so <unk> <unk> in society that nobody would <unk> to <unk> in <unk> .
And it &apos;s also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I had a simple note on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that nobody has <unk> already <unk> to you .
This is what the <unk> is what the <unk> .
And then you go to the <unk> store for a <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there &apos;s a big number of <unk> .
We can make six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one just store .
You have to <unk> that there &apos;s choice .
<unk> fields : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a kid , you could get all the <unk> services , <unk> <unk> , who were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , you don &apos;t <unk> it .
A <unk> of that , by the way , was that the phone never <unk> .
These days they went .
Now we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> , especially between cell phones .
Here &apos;s cell phones phones phones <unk> .
My <unk> is the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
If you don &apos;t have that you &apos;ve still seen it in the house , you &apos;re very <unk> that you &apos;re going to get it .
And what happens at the end is that people <unk> and ask the question , and they ask this question . And you know what the answer is ? The answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
You can buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t make a cell phone that can &apos;t do anything .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , is <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> : You don &apos;t happen in the United States you <unk> from <unk> and the <unk> you &apos;re going to do .
Instead , <unk> by <unk> , and the <unk> says , &quot; OK , we can do A , or you know , &quot; <unk> <unk> , and these <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> <unk> . What do you want to do you want to do ? &quot;
You said , &quot; <unk> , what would you do you do ? &quot;
And the <unk> says , &quot; At the <unk> , and the <unk> has these <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; You know , if you were me , what would you say ? &quot;
And the <unk> , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; , &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; -- that &apos;s what it looks like .
But , in fact , it &apos;s not a <unk> weight and the responsibility for making decisions by somebody who knows something , <unk> the <unk> , to another one that &apos;s certainly <unk> -- and almost certainly is <unk> -- and then not in the <unk> <unk> to make decisions , and then in the <unk> <unk> to make decisions , which is not to be able to make decisions the patient decisions .
There &apos;s a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me and you , whether you think about it &apos;s not making sense , because we can &apos;t <unk> .
But if we can &apos;t <unk> , why can we <unk> them ?
The answer is , what we call the <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , let &apos;s talk about how we <unk> is our <unk> now is a question of choice , as you see in this <unk> , &quot; We don &apos;t want to <unk> kids . We don &apos;t want to get a <unk> : we have to <unk> it .
And we can <unk> how many times we have .
That means that every <unk> , at <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I went to the family and the <unk> , a time perspective , almost for anybody , was that we had to <unk> as soon as possible , and you &apos;re going to get kids to the <unk> .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and what to do after .
<unk> , all of that is really to play .
<unk> at very smart students , and they <unk> their 20 percent less work than a time .
And they &apos;re not <unk> , because they &apos;re less <unk> , not because they &apos;re less <unk> .
but why am I <unk> , I started to say , &quot; <unk> <unk> or not ? Do you want to do that now ? &quot;
&quot; Would you like to think before ? I think before your children or to career ? &quot;
I &apos;m <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even though that <unk> don &apos;t <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and do not have a <unk> <unk> to my <unk> .
And they have to do that . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the job is : we &apos;re <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> , because the technology allows us to work every day , from every corner of the planet , <unk> that we have from the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> , and I don &apos;t say any which the <unk> works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this incredible choice of choice , what do we have about work ? It &apos;s that we have to decide , <unk> at every moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son to play <unk> , with the <unk> in a <unk> , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> on the <unk> .
And even though they &apos;re all <unk> , every minute that we see our son <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re also <unk> , we &apos;re going to answer this ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this <unk> ? I have to <unk> this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , that &apos;s all about the experience of your son , very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , any part of all of us look , things and big , objects , life is a life question of life , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but not all was a question of choice .
The world of today is going to be <unk> to this : The <unk> is , or <unk> ?
The answer is <unk> .
So , the <unk> <unk> we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the <unk> .
<unk> this <unk> <unk> two effects <unk> people .
The first one , <unk> , is that it &apos;s <unk> instead of <unk> .
With a lot of <unk> between you choose , you get to , it &apos;s very difficult to do it .
I &apos;ll give you an example of <unk> : a <unk> study <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> has had access to the <unk> data , the <unk> <unk> society , with about a million <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> companies .
What she found out is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> to <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s 10 percent less in less than when they &apos;re available for five . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> between them , it &apos;s hard to decide , and the choice is <unk> to decide .
And in <unk> , and still in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> <unk> never come .
<unk> that doesn &apos;t mean only that these <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don &apos;t have enough money , it &apos;s also saying that the decision is so <unk> that you can also <unk> the <unk> <unk> of work .
They &apos;re not <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> to five <unk> <unk> per year from the work of work , which would be well <unk> .
So , <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices .
And I think we &apos;re going to change the world like this .
&quot; And to end , to the <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
You have to make the right decision , if it &apos;s for the <unk> , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and you get the wrong <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even though we can <unk> <unk> <unk> and make a choice , at the end of how we <unk> were <unk> with less <unk> with less <unk> than the <unk> .
And that for several reasons .
One of them is that with so many <unk> between you <unk> , if you <unk> one and it &apos;s not perfect , you can imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> <unk> of choice , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the decision <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> by decision ,
even when it was a decision .
More choices there are , the easier to <unk> than any <unk> that is <unk> of the choice .
<unk> , there &apos;s one thing that <unk> call .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well known as the value we give things to <unk> from what we call .
And then , you know , when there are so many <unk> you can see the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and be less <unk> than the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m going to <unk> with all those who are not in New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably <unk> .
There &apos;s this <unk> to <unk> .
A <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not going to be anything . But what he thinks , &quot; Well , <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; All my <unk> are going to be <unk> . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> right in front of your house . &quot;
And it <unk> two weeks <unk> that &apos;s <unk> -- every day -- the ability to <unk> where you want .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the more of the <unk> we have to <unk> , the more the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It &apos;s about living the moment , and maybe live the slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you <unk> , you &apos;re going to be not to do the other .
The things that don &apos;t <unk> have so many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new <unk> .
It &apos;s almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were just one like , and they were <unk> , and they were <unk> , and they were <unk> , only after <unk> a life and they <unk> a lot of times , they <unk> to go well .
So , I started <unk> a couple of new when the people were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> said , &quot; You want to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
I want them to <unk> or with <unk> ? &quot; <unk> &quot; or &quot; <unk> &quot; ?
&quot; Do you want to <unk> them ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> wants to <unk> or <unk> ? &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot;
I was <unk> , and after a while I was able to say , &quot; I want the guy , &quot; I want the only guy . &quot; It had no idea what it was , so for a time , I all want to be <unk> <unk> , and then I was going to the <unk> <unk> , and then I was going to <unk> out of the <unk> , with the best <unk> of <unk> <unk> I &apos;ve ever had .
It was the <unk> . With all that choice I had <unk> the best .
But I &apos;m <unk> worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that I was worse with all that choice , my <unk> were <unk> ,
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn &apos;t get any <unk> when I was just one guy , but when I had 100 different , at least one , at least one , at least one , at least one had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After <unk> <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> at <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in life of people don &apos;t do the <unk> that these have <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> .
And this is less <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of <unk> if it &apos;s got it .
Because if I do it , I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth will be more to this .
&quot; You were better when you were worse , &quot; The reason you &apos;d better when you were worse is when you were even worse , you could <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world we live in -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things at the <unk> of <unk> .
You &apos;ve never been <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> are <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; Yes , you want to . &quot;
I mean -- little <unk> moment -- that I &apos;m really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn &apos;t do it better , I didn &apos;t get <unk> .
But <unk> don &apos;t always have a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of <unk> a couple of <unk> <unk> when there &apos;s only that kind of <unk> is that when you &apos;re not <unk> , and you will ask , &quot; Why ? &quot;
Who is <unk> ? &quot; The answer is <unk> .
The world is <unk> . What can I do with it ?
When there are hundreds of <unk> , and you get one <unk> , and you &apos;ll notice who &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s clear that the <unk> you are .
You could have better .
With hundreds of <unk> , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even if the <unk> is <unk> , they <unk> and they <unk> their own .
over the last few years , the <unk> is <unk> in the world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only one , but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is that people have experiences because the <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation think that <unk> is they are .
So the final result is that in general we &apos;re better , <unk> , but we &apos;re worse .
Let me show you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all get to good and it &apos;s completely <unk> . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no <unk> that a little bit better than not <unk> at all , but this is not <unk> that a lot of choice is better than a bit .
There &apos;s a <unk> value , <unk> . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve been <unk> with a piece of the level that we have choices to our lives .
Now , from a <unk> point -- I almost finished -- I have almost finished -- <unk> &apos;s <unk> , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What allows all of this choice in the <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There are a lot of places in the world , and you get <unk> , where the problem is not that they have choice .
The problem is they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> that I &apos;m talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> talked about yesterday about how <unk> those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> are <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> of money .
I mean these choices , <unk> and <unk> , is not just <unk> .
I &apos;m <unk> <unk> .
They make worse being .
If a little bit of what we do in our society <unk> choice was <unk> in those where people have too many possibilities , they &apos;re not only going to <unk> , but our <unk> .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of <unk> does well -- not only not only the poor -- not only on the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we <unk> .
So to end up , &quot; <unk> , you can become anything you want , &quot;
<unk> , people culture , they said , &quot; What are you going to that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s <unk> that you can &apos;t get anything in a <unk> of glass . &quot;
&quot; A <unk> imagination , a <unk> view of the world -- &quot;
and I <unk> it like this , at the beginning .
But then , I realized that , I realized that that fish knows that fish knows a long one .
Because the reality of fact is that if you <unk> the <unk> , so that &quot; everything is possible . &quot; You know , &quot; You can <unk> the freedom . &quot;
If you <unk> the <unk> so that you can <unk> the <unk> .
You have <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Everybody needs a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
