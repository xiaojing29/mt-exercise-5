<unk> year I showed these <unk> for <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years had had had been the size of the United States , it &apos;s <unk> of 40 percent .
And I &apos;m going to do this <unk> the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> is , in some sense , the heart <unk> system .
They <unk> <unk> and <unk> of the summer .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You see , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you can see , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you can see , you know , you can see , you know ,
That &apos;s the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> in the summer .
You can see that the ice <unk> ice , five years or more , is like the blood , which is where you &apos;re going to be here .
In 25 years , it was so , in this .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> the ground around the ocean <unk> where there are huge amount of <unk> that , <unk> are <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , that <unk> could <unk> , that <unk> could <unk> , this point of not <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is already <unk> by water .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> with a team <unk> team a <unk> team <unk> <unk> last <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : She &apos;s good . The question is if we &apos;re also going to do it .
That &apos;s why this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> river in <unk> .
<unk> had never <unk> like that .
This is the <unk> river , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how to know how to <unk> the sea <unk> on <unk> , here is where the sea the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
And on the other side of the planet : <unk> , the largest ice <unk> of the planet .
<unk> month scientists have <unk> that the ice is in <unk> , and that the <unk> <unk> , which is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> at six feet of the <unk> level , like in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the <unk> third big <unk> of ice , you see a few years ago , they were <unk> .
40 percent of the world population <unk> <unk> by that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : this <unk> is the source of the water <unk> of this city .
The <unk> is <unk> .
But when I <unk> it , the same thing happens to the water .
In California , the <unk> on the <unk> <unk> is <unk> of 40 percent .
The <unk> <unk> are in crisis .
The <unk> , as you read , they &apos;re <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in the world <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> to a normal <unk> out of the normal and without <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years than the <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> .
If you look at the <unk> context , if you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we &apos;ve been 70 million <unk> of CO2 <unk> -- 25 million <unk> in the oceans .
Look at the <unk> area of the <unk> <unk> , from <unk> , and on both of the <unk> <unk> , where there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the oceans .
The largest cause of global warming , together to the <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
The oil is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of two countries with more emissions , together .
And you &apos;re going to build a lot of other <unk> .
But we &apos;re going to be <unk> .
These are the projects in the last few years and some of the <unk> <unk> .
And every way , there &apos;s a policy <unk> in our country .
The <unk> of <unk> and oil have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to show me something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> .
You may have seen it on the <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk> in America .
It &apos;s happened around <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> . â™« <unk> the <unk> is a kind of <unk> and happy .
It &apos;s <unk> here in America , and <unk> our economy .
<unk> <unk> is more and more <unk> .
It &apos;s good price , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : From here , you know , you know , you know , you know , <unk> <unk> .
The largest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- not know what they &apos;re talking about .
So , the <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , a part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> , we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> <unk> at our business .
So , we have a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public <unk> and <unk> the truth .
In fact , <unk> isn &apos;t <unk> .
We think it &apos;s <unk> -- it &apos;s also a good <unk> .
So , we don &apos;t <unk> change .
We could do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you &apos;ve heard about it .
So I &apos;m going to go around the <unk> , as it &apos;s about <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> machines are a little <unk> , but this is the sound of the <unk> technology .
<unk> is between the global <unk> of global <unk> , but the <unk> technology that you see it changes .
And let &apos;s look at this : this is the <unk> technology .
<unk> : <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : America is in the crisis ; the economy , the national security crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all of : our <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and oil .
Now , there &apos;s a new solution to <unk> solution .
America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan to <unk> America to work , <unk> more <unk> , and help <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we could solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
Al <unk> : This is the last .
<unk> : <unk> : This is <unk> energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways to <unk> the <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , the sun , a new <unk> network .
<unk> <unk> two : <unk> <unk> for <unk> work .
<unk> : <unk> America . It &apos;s time to be <unk> .
And he was : A old <unk> <unk> says , &quot; If you want to go to the only one .
If you want to go away , you go back , you go . &quot;
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year I did a <unk> on <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to try to <unk> it on how the machine works .
So , I &apos;m going to go . And for the ones that the other time , there were no longer <unk> .
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were <unk> less than a <unk> <unk> of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second .
Everything is simply <unk> .
This is the <unk> machine .
And these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk> .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> <unk> feet , and it &apos;s got a <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> image of <unk> in building so you can see the <unk> .
<unk> 10 <unk> last year , we &apos;ve <unk> the machine for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was because of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
It &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> of particles that had made everything around the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles inside the <unk> .
In other words , when I was that image 10 <unk> , <unk> that the <unk> machine , which is a great <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if it was to do <unk> us , or so when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the <unk> page was this .
That means we had a <unk> <unk> <unk> beyond what scientific impact .
And I was going to be a problem with the machine , had to just these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine works at the <unk> of <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you <unk> and <unk> , &quot; It &apos;s not true . I &apos;m too <unk> . &quot;
And instead they can do it because when they &apos;re very <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees , at a temperature <unk> to the space between stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> between the <unk> <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and that are <unk> of about 30 <unk> .
They &apos;re about 50 <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We &apos;ve <unk> them and <unk> .
Now they &apos;re now <unk> all of their <unk> .
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> will be new .
And <unk> , and we get it to get data to <unk> or <unk> , and continue so our <unk> to find out what are the <unk> that <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in some ways , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> on the value of science and engineering <unk> . It &apos;s easy to <unk> .
I think that &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s so hard , I think it &apos;s the value of things like <unk> .
I want to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> , in <unk> of <unk> experiments , his <unk> was Michael <unk> , said , &quot; No , it &apos;s not so <unk> for the human mind how the science <unk> that ideas of <unk> are <unk> , that we don &apos;t have to <unk> <unk> , and that we don &apos;t have to <unk> <unk> , and that are not <unk> .
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to start when , from children , <unk> with <unk> .
<unk> as <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , actually , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way we &apos;re going to be part of the world around us .
So , by <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects , with my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started to <unk> , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having the <unk> <unk> as a digital <unk> that &apos;s moving on a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a information with both hands , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> with both <unk>
and we &apos;re going to do it ?
The question was so interesting that I &apos;m going to try to explore the answer , building the <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a big <unk> computers like a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a big <unk> computers like a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , they can <unk> them , and they have a screen and they have a screen and they have a screen .
But <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> the digital information .
And as they become more <unk> , they &apos;re more <unk> , <unk> of the movement , of others , and as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement , we can explore new <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ll be <unk> with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you video to show video the video , if you &apos;re going to be on the other side .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , they &apos;re <unk> to what they &apos;re doing .
If they &apos;re <unk> , you know , they can <unk> it , and they can <unk> it .
If they &apos;re <unk> , you know , they can <unk> it , and they can <unk> it .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We realized that one of the interesting <unk> was the <unk> that one of the <unk> was the <unk> that we could use common on data , like if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as <unk> of <unk> and I can <unk> them for <unk> of the <unk> , where you &apos;re <unk> .
and I can <unk> for <unk> color in the central color , where you &apos;re <unk> .
And if we can do it too , we can <unk> a little bit .
I &apos;m also <unk> <unk> possibility , like <unk> , the math and games where people can try and <unk> the <unk> , where people can try and <unk> the results immediately .
I &apos;m now --
This is a <unk> sequence I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a game of words that is in half between <unk> and <unk> .
And <unk> , at all , you know , <unk> a letter to case , <unk> , <unk> , at every <unk> <unk> <unk> a letter .
Then , after about 30 seconds <unk> , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s kids are <unk> in <unk> to the <unk> <unk> , I did so that I <unk> them and <unk> a video .
They &apos;re very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things like this is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot .
And I just say , &quot; <unk> of words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who do it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , there on the right .
In fact , it was just <unk> .
They were only <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
And I had to build a tool for <unk> . He &apos;s <unk> .
It can be new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can be new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
<unk> : Now , he brought a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> work !
So , we <unk> <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
-- <unk> their story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can tell him how to do you .
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can tell him how to do you .
<unk> : <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I &apos;m going to show you is a <unk> , that I made , <unk> , to <unk> and <unk> music .
It &apos;s a tool that I did , to <unk> and <unk> music .
The <unk> here is <unk> by <unk> like <unk> , and the <unk> .
And you can <unk> these <unk> different <unk> , and you can choose which to use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of <unk> to your <unk> .
And I just wanted to do a <unk> , &quot; and a sequence . &quot;
These are actually <unk> that you can control from me , like <unk> and <unk> .
I &apos;m going to <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> it .
And then there are the effects of <unk> as time and <unk> , which is <unk> at the entire sequence .
<unk> how it works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> in two <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , another <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m going to get a <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : Now , I &apos;m going to <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> : And now , I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> , so I can control the effect of this .
<unk> : I can <unk> the entire sequence of time on one side or on the other .
<unk> : <unk> : And now , we &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> to give more <unk> .
<unk> : I can <unk> the sequence .
So I don &apos;t have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
And now , I can finally <unk> the entire <unk> on the left <unk> the <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain work and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibility that we &apos;re trying to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to <unk> is that this new generation of <unk> objects for <unk> to <unk> with media <unk> , which <unk> information in our way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time of talking to you all .
I &apos;m a <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to books is , but it &apos;s more than this , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the <unk> of my life .
And it doesn &apos;t look like that .
But , said , this particular thing happened to be <unk> in my life and in my career , which has brought me to <unk> the whole <unk> with this work .
The particular thing is I &apos;ve been writing this book , this <unk> called &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which , <unk> from my <unk> books , for some reason in the world and <unk> a big <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that <unk> everywhere , people like me , if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I &apos;m going to be now , and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear that you can &apos;t be able to do better ?
You don &apos;t really want to be writing for all life without being able to make a book that can <unk> somebody ? &quot;
What can you do ? &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , and I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I was <unk> to say to people -- I was a <unk> -- that I wanted to be a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to be <unk> by fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t <unk> to be able to have success ?
Can you have no fear of the <unk> <unk> you ?
You don &apos;t fear of doing this <unk> for all life without any life that nothing would come out and die on a <unk> dreams with the mouth of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
So you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yeah , I &apos;m afraid of all of those things .
I &apos;ve always had fear .
And I also fear of a lot of other things that people can &apos;t <unk> .
As <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as I &apos;m going to write what I thought and <unk> <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It &apos;s <unk> that anyone who are <unk> to be <unk> by a work that you feel <unk> to do .
But what &apos;s so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> about <unk> health <unk> about <unk> health <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not ?
As my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> , and I don &apos;t remember one time in his <unk> years of activity that was asked if she had to be <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> that was never -- that <unk> of John <unk> , how did it ?
So , don &apos;t you like that , <unk> ?
<unk> , the engineers like <unk> have not been , in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
We have enough , we have enough , and not only <unk> , but we have this <unk> of all , we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
And so , not even though you look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often for them .
And the ones that are not <unk> to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before you die , in the last <unk> said , &quot; Every book , I &apos;ve got a little more &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> about work .
But we don &apos;t <unk> when I say , because we &apos;ve heard these things so long , we &apos;ve got all been <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are <unk> in some ways , and that art , at the end , <unk> , and that art , at the end , and that art , at the end , and that art , at the end , and the <unk> are going to
And the question I want to <unk> to all here today is : you &apos;re <unk> with this idea ?
You &apos;re going to get this thing -- because it &apos;s also going to be <unk> by a <unk> distance to me not <unk> this <unk> .
I think it &apos;s <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s also <unk> and I don &apos;t want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better <unk> our <unk> <unk> to live .
And I &apos;m sure I know that , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that I &apos;m in my career .
I &apos;m going to look at , I &apos;m rather young , I &apos;m going to be a little bit of a lot , I &apos;m rather young , I &apos;m rather young , I &apos;m just going to look at it , I &apos;m rather young , I have about 40 years .
I have about four <unk> work in me .
And it &apos;s very <unk> that anything you know , in the world is going to be <unk> by the world as the work that <unk> after the work of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we &apos;re all <unk> friends -- is <unk> that my greatest <unk> is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
You know , this is the kind of <unk> that door a person to start <unk> <unk> at nine nine of the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I love to continue doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it seems to me , after many <unk> , that the way to work is to <unk> write a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to find some way to find a <unk> distance between me , which I &apos;m <unk> , and my natural <unk> that you could get to get . And as I was going to do it , and as we could look through the time , trying to find other society to find out how to look at the time , trying to find other society , and more <unk> than to find other society to see if we could find some of the best ideas .
as to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that <unk> me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
because they were <unk> and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don &apos;t believe that creativity is <unk> creativity , OK ?
And it <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and that <unk> to men from a few <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for <unk> reasons .
The <unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
The <unk> were the same idea , but I &apos;m going to be that kind of <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> , because the <unk> don &apos;t really understand that a <unk> was particularly <unk> .
And I think that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that was literally <unk> in the <unk> of the study of an artist , a little <unk> , and <unk> out of <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the result of that work .
And here &apos;s , that &apos;s the distance of the <unk> that I talk -- that <unk> you &apos;re going to <unk> you from the results of your work .
And everyone <unk> that was so <unk> , right ?
So the artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like for example , no ?
If your work was <unk> not to <unk> all the <unk> , you all <unk> that <unk> state of <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it wasn &apos;t all <unk> , right ?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people are <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
And then the <unk> <unk> and everything <unk> , and we &apos;re going to be this big idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe , we put it out of the <unk> .
This was the <unk> principle of <unk> and people think that creativity is completely <unk> by <unk> .
And for the first time in history , <unk> to <unk> this or the artist as a <unk> <unk> that was rather than a <unk> <unk> person .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think that &apos;s going to be a simple person to believe to be like a source , the source , the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> is a responsibility for a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> <unk> to make human <unk> .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> the <unk> and create all these <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure to have been <unk> artists in <unk> 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think that &apos;s , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do it ?
<unk> back to a more <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe no .
You might not be 500 years of thinking in a <unk> talk about 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the public who are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on their <unk> , <unk> , do that <unk> people <unk> <unk> <unk> on their projects .
I &apos;m probably not going to tell you all about this thing .
But the question I &apos;d like to <unk> is -- why isn &apos;t it ?
Why don &apos;t we <unk> it in this way ?
Because it &apos;s more sense of everything that has ever heard about the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And so , as anyone who ever ever ever ever <unk> to do something -- so we &apos;re basically , we &apos;re all here -- it &apos;s not <unk> <unk> .
And in fact , it can be completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> <unk> , who has now 90 years , but it was a <unk> for all life and said that during his <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> out of the <unk> <unk> , and he said , &quot; within the <unk> , and <unk> it , inside the <unk> .
And he said that it was like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> <unk> to her <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to get it , because he did the earth under his feet .
I decided to have one thing to do at that point and was , words , &quot; <unk> as a <unk> . &quot;
And so he was <unk> to home and he was <unk> by this <unk> , and not had to get a piece of paper and a <unk> enough to do , as the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> on the page .
I was sometimes not <unk> to be enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> them <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> through and she would <unk> them to <unk> , looking for them and <unk> to <unk> , how he said , &quot; another <unk> . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this piece never -- there were no time -- there were no moments when the time that the was almost <unk> , OK ?
So , he was <unk> at home and he was trying to <unk> the <unk> and <unk> them through , and he was a <unk> right in the while he was <unk> , and then he said , that it was like if you were <unk> with the other hand and <unk> .
It <unk> the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk> , but the <unk> , from the last word .
So when I <unk> it -- it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not all my <unk> process -- I &apos;m not a <unk> .
I &apos;m a <unk> , and my way to <unk> is ; I &apos;m going to <unk> the same <unk> every day and <unk> and work on it .
But even I &apos;ve <unk> it , I &apos;ve <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I think that &apos;s a lot of you &apos;ve done .
You know , even though the work and ideas <unk> me <unk> me from a certain source I can &apos;t <unk> <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it to do not <unk> us to <unk> our head , but rather , what do you do <unk> <unk> ?
And as I &apos;m going to be the best example I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;ve <unk> different years ago for a <unk> .
And I &apos;m talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> <unk> , trying to control , <unk> , <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , he was <unk> , and a day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> everything .
<unk> fast and everything is a little <unk> of <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> , that &apos;s going to be in his head as a <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the <unk> , but not as <unk> .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it &apos;s not a <unk> , it &apos;s got a <unk> .
So , it starts to feel like this old species of <unk> <unk> <unk> in him like , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to lose this song .
I &apos;m not <unk> enough , and I can &apos;t <unk> . &quot;
And instead of going to go to the <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> .
And he <unk> the whole process and made something completely new .
And he just <unk> the sky and said , &quot; <unk> , you don &apos;t see what I &apos;m <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Do you think it &apos;s going to write a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , if you &apos;re going to take care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> <unk> more <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And his process <unk> <unk> after this .
It wasn &apos;t the work , it was still <unk> as a always <unk> .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when I was <unk> <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which was <unk> that was <unk> , which was <unk> that wasn &apos;t going to be a <unk> thing .
But I &apos;m going to do this , wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this thing that was <unk> and <unk> that , but it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
So how much I &apos;m going to change a little bit even the way I &apos;m going to talk about , and already <unk> me once .
This idea , I was <unk> when I was <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; and <unk> in one of those <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re working when we &apos;re working on something and we &apos;re working with something , and we can &apos;t think that &apos;s going to be a <unk> , which is going to be the <unk> book .
Not only <unk> , just the book written .
And I started thinking about this project .
But then I &apos;m going to try and <unk> it .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> corner of my <unk> at a <unk> of the room .
And I said to <unk> , &quot; <unk> , what we know if this book is not going to be <unk> my , no ?
Because you see I &apos;m <unk> everything I have , I &apos;m not going to do that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , you don &apos;t do it .
I &apos;m going to write the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to please be <unk> that I &apos;m <unk> to do my own part . &quot; Because it is so , OK -- <unk> it &apos;s so , OK -- <unk> it &apos;s in the North Africa , and <unk> music that will be <unk> for hours and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk> .
But every while , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> in fact .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you &apos;ve all seen , at some point , a <unk> like this .
And it was like the time , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> , and it wasn &apos;t doing anything different from the <unk> , like the <unk> <unk> before , but it was <unk> .
And all of a sudden , not just as a human .
But they &apos;re <unk> from <unk> and <unk> in the fire of the <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , they <unk> it .
<unk> , <unk> , God , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , &quot; God , &quot; God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
And you know , you know , when the <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; which you can feel in <unk> or <unk> .
In <unk> , when a artist did something impossible to <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it &apos;s because we need to do .
But the problem comes the next day , for the <unk> , when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 of <unk> and <unk> it &apos;s <unk> that are 11 of <unk> and <unk> it &apos;s no longer .
It &apos;s just a lot of <unk> with <unk> , and maybe not <unk> <unk> to <unk> that <unk> .
And maybe nobody would <unk> the name of God still as <unk> , and what is to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so <unk> if you can &apos;t believe , <unk> , <unk> , the most <unk> <unk> of your being come from you .
But you just want to just <unk> you to get data from a <unk> source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk> when you &apos;re finished .
And , you know , if we think in this way , it all changes .
And so I started to <unk> , and it &apos;s certainly how I <unk> it for several months during the <unk> of the book that was soon , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , not being <unk> .
I don &apos;t <unk> . It &apos;s just your work .
You can <unk> for your <unk> , any way .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , you &apos;re going to be <unk> to you to <unk> some kind of <unk> , for a only time through your <unk> , then &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
You know , do the same <unk> .
And &quot; <unk> ! &quot; You know , &quot; You know ,
I think it &apos;s about it and I think it &apos;s <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; You know , just to have a human love and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know , I &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects on the human genome on what it can <unk> and discovery of new genes .
We &apos;re now <unk> a new way : we started to <unk> biology and now at <unk> the <unk> code , and now we &apos;re going to start with that digital <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We &apos;ve always been trying to <unk> questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; That &apos;s something that many <unk> I think have <unk> to understand a lot of <unk> .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> terms .
We &apos;re <unk> for almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome is <unk> to <unk> by the world <unk> of the computer <unk> in the world of computers .
Now , we can <unk> the life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the most small species from the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> a little more little .
We &apos;re able to <unk> a <unk> of genes about 500 that are here .
But when we look at his <unk> map , it &apos;s very simple than our .
So , this is simple .
But when we look at the genes that we can <unk> , one at time , it &apos;s very <unk> that this can bring a <unk> cell .
So I thought that the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> so that we could <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of &quot; Can we <unk> a <unk> ? &quot;
Can the chemistry chemistry <unk> that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The speed that we are able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the code , instead of <unk> code , but it &apos;s <unk> .
And our <unk> <unk> the <unk> on a <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve been more than 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> many <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before the first <unk> .
But we found that DNA is very hard .
There are thousands of thousands of machines in the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA , of <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> process : the <unk> is a <unk> process : the <unk> is <unk> .
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a little virus that <unk> bacteria .
We designed <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> it in the bacteria , the bacteria <unk> to read this <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> particles .
The <unk> particles were <unk> by cells , they &apos;re <unk> back and <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ve been talking about the <unk> industry that they &apos;ve been <unk> with their <unk> <unk> that they &apos;ve been <unk> this model .
They have more than you .
And I think that &apos;s a situation where the software can really build its own <unk> system in a <unk> system .
But we could do the bigger things in big .
You could build the whole <unk> of <unk> .
They are more than <unk> <unk> <unk> code .
So we thought we &apos;d be <unk> in <unk> of the virus , so that we can change the <unk> to understand what are the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
The <unk> is <unk> , and if we <unk> with information <unk> into a computer , these have to be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> the <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We found , 30 <unk> , <unk> . If we were used that original sequence never <unk> to do it .
One part of the process is design <unk> <unk> that <unk> with all other <unk> of the <unk> <unk> to build more small <unk> that <unk> together .
You have to be <unk> here .
You &apos;ve probably read that <unk> us in the <unk> .
So , we have a <unk> code that &apos;s <unk> on four <unk> : At , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , and there &apos;s a <unk> order of <unk> <unk> for every <unk> .
So we can use the code for write words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did was <unk> .
Some of them have been <unk> by the fact that it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started <unk> parts , <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to them to get to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , we &apos;ve made these <unk> <unk> in <unk> so that we &apos;re <unk> <unk> because we &apos;re trying to create a very <unk> <unk> as you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to <unk> the process .
So , this seems the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When I started these <unk> <unk> much more <unk> than 100 <unk> <unk> , we don &apos;t <unk> directly into the <unk> <unk> .
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> biology .
So we &apos;ve been <unk> other <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to try to do another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA .
Here &apos;s an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> is <unk> .
In 12 hours -- it &apos;s <unk> exactly as it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely <unk> .
You could live in <unk> .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and <unk> to find new <unk> <unk> of water .
In fact , NASA has shown that this is what happens .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we &apos;ve built using these <unk> , just using these <unk> , just using the <unk> design <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This image wasn &apos;t <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a very big <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are picture that I &apos;m going to be a time of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we did .
They are more than <unk> <unk> code .
It &apos;s the largest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by man .
It has a <unk> <unk> <unk> for 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a 10 <unk> without spaces , we &apos;re going to <unk> this <unk> code .
Now , how do we do it work ?
Of course , through a virus is a <unk> game .
It &apos;s a little bit more <unk> when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s <unk> cells , even when it &apos;s about cells , how our : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the process of <unk> .
In <unk> , the <unk> is instead inside the cell , but we &apos;ve <unk> <unk> that we are able to do a <unk> <unk> from one cell to another and <unk> .
We &apos;ve got a <unk> <unk> <unk> from a <unk> species .
The two are different how men from <unk> .
We &apos;ve been <unk> some <unk> more <unk> way to decide what you choose to choose to do .
He <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> so that we <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> went down to the cell .
And <unk> <unk> that we didn &apos;t want to go beyond , but we tried to <unk> it .
This is one of the major <unk> .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> from some part , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to the species .
So who thinks about evolution as a only <unk> at the time you have no <unk> to understand that much of biology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell , they didn &apos;t get one .
The <unk> <unk> we <unk> it .
It &apos;s <unk> , and it <unk> the other <unk> like <unk> , <unk> , and we &apos;re <unk> with only the cell and we &apos;re <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk> .
It became blue because of the genes that we &apos;ve been <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species are <unk> to <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> of all in a new species , <unk> on software that we &apos;ve <unk> in the cell .
All of the <unk> are <unk> , and when we <unk> the code that <unk> <unk> exactly what we &apos;ve <unk> is going to be .
Now , this may be <unk> <unk> , but we can <unk> the software <unk> we can change things in a <unk> way .
Now , I &apos;ve already been <unk> that here is not talking about <unk> -- but by <unk> <unk> by three million years and a half years and a half years , and I &apos;ve already said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the <unk> that we &apos;re going to <unk> new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s enough to be <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion people to <unk> billion in the next 40 years .
Right to give you an example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> ; in 40 years , there will be four years .
We &apos;re going to find <unk> food , water <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> for six billion people .
We &apos;re even more <unk> to do it for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> .
That means percent of <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process to <unk> , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
In the more we have to realize the whole <unk> of CO2 from these materials that will be in the atmosphere .
At the day today , because of the <unk> <unk> in the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry only only one of the <unk> industry , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here are <unk> data from the reality and our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , thank you to these <unk> <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think of these 20 million genes or try to <unk> the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , to make <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of a small team , and create <unk> biology <unk> .
And it &apos;s just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to choose <unk> , chemistry or chemistry , chemistry , chemistry , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software that we &apos;re working on to be able to <unk> and design species to the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how to be .
We know exactly what their own <unk> code .
We &apos;re now going to be on the <unk> generation .
You saw you saw that <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We &apos;ve been <unk> <unk> , and third generation that will be <unk> <unk> <unk> than <unk> <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can be <unk> a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> <unk> in matter before we &apos;re working with for cells that can reach this purpose , and we think we can get this purpose , and we think we could reach the first <unk> of <unk> generation .
<unk> solar <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> in the world , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we &apos;ve <unk> in <unk> .
It &apos;s going to be in the ocean , at about <unk> feet <unk> at the temperature .
It &apos;s <unk> by CO2 using <unk> as energy as energy as energy as well .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2 , which can easily be <unk> through <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So we think we &apos;re going to be able to <unk> what the question of the basic question . &quot; What is life is life , we &apos;re going to be able to <unk> the whole whole <unk> industry .
<unk> . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you ?
It &apos;s going to be a main source of energy .
And we &apos;re working on to use the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk> .
You saw this year with flu , we &apos;re always back in a year and with a dollar in less when it &apos;s about <unk> .
I think that you can change <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that &apos;s how the future could start looking at <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> the evolution with <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and then <unk> cells .
We &apos;re so much <unk> from the people .
So our purpose is to do so much to try to live long enough to try to <unk> . Thank you very much .
First of all , I &apos;m going to show you , the <unk> possible , some fundamental work , of the new technology that we &apos;ve brought to a <unk> <unk> <unk> . This is <unk> .
This is a environment where you can <unk> is at local level that <unk> with a huge amount of data .
So we &apos;re seeing here , we &apos;re seeing <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a fast <unk> , <unk> images like we want .
And no matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these <unk> <unk> of data or images .
Most common are common photographs , but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in any screen . It &apos;s also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a book , example of data not images .
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> is a <unk> .
And so you can &apos;t do that <unk> and not of images , we can do something like that , to make a really see that it &apos;s a real <unk> <unk> , not a picture .
It could be a way to read a <unk> book .
I don &apos;t want to <unk> it .
This is an example of the <unk> . This is about a number of <unk> .
Every image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the <unk> and the beautiful experience of read the real <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> kind of a half .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the <unk> .
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much <unk> than what you use in a normal <unk> , and we &apos;ve <unk> to you in the <unk> <unk> .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or even other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
And I think that this <unk> <unk> to <unk> and other <unk> <unk> , not to be <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don &apos;t want to lose time , if we don &apos;t to say that we &apos;re going to be able to <unk> it .
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> over the <unk> image .
So now , now I &apos;m going to do something else .
This is actually alive from the Web ; you can see it .
This is a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a very interesting <unk> computer . And the very interesting <unk> <unk> , a student of the Washington <unk> , with the help of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s alive on the Web , <unk> <unk> .
You can see when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from another , and have this kind of experience <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of images here actually a meaning .
The <unk> of <unk> computers have <unk> these images together , so that we can <unk> the <unk> <unk> that <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> . So here you see elements of a <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> to be <unk> , and these things are all <unk> at <unk> level .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> data and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that we did for the first time the summer of <unk> to show you what we &apos;re really going to be the key <unk> behind this technology , the <unk> technology . And it &apos;s not so <unk> to look at the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> and so forth .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of types of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> . <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> a image that has been discovered in this model that <unk> model .
So I &apos;m all <unk> images and they &apos;re all <unk> at the <unk> level .
And it &apos;s possible to <unk> it .
You know , I would never thought to end .
It &apos;s very <unk> <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of <unk> : from those of the <unk> that are <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> number , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in this environment .
And if I can , I can try and <unk> those <unk> .
Many are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
You know , you find a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from the <unk> to the physics of this environment .
The <unk> is that we can do things with the environment . This is now <unk> data from the entire <unk> of how we <unk> the earth , from the entire <unk> of how we <unk> the earth , from the <unk> view and <unk> all those data together .
All of those pictures become <unk> together , the <unk> of the parts .
You have a model of the whole thing that you &apos;re going to be .
Think about this as the <unk> of <unk> work on Earth .
It &apos;s something that we &apos;re going to be <unk> as people , and the <unk> that we &apos;re going to <unk> with the use .
Their picture are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people .
If somebody &apos;s the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name , my favorite picture of the <unk> <unk> <unk> all of those data , and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> to <unk> in that space , in that <unk> , in that <unk> , using the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all this is very <unk> models of every part of the Earth , <unk> not only by <unk> <unk> and <unk> images .
Thank you very much .
CA : I understand that ? What do is ? What your software is that your software will be like to do is that at some point in the world , all of the photographs , are all around the world are <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is we &apos;re looking at it .
It &apos;s creating <unk> , if you want , in these images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the <unk> of these images .
And the thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> information that a lot of these <unk> images .
As you do a <unk> research on the Web , you get a <unk> and the text on the page , it &apos;s a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture is going to all your picture ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really enormous . It &apos;s a <unk> effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it &apos;s really incredible .
<unk> : I &apos;m going to show you very much .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is the <unk> that you can &apos;t have <unk> <unk> <unk> , who <unk> the past the wind in the wind <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> in the <unk> of the plants .
And you think that <unk> <unk> <unk> even beyond the <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> still the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , to remember the <unk> of the <unk> , and that the idea that we live in there is no sense , but it &apos;s only a model , but it &apos;s just a model of reality , is , and reality , and reality ,
The <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> did , well , or <unk> , a lot of <unk> .
And , of course , all of course , <unk> <unk> .
All right . All of <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
So we have to <unk> the death of death , so we don &apos;t <unk> if you could <unk> and <unk> --
We all have an art .
What <unk> is the <unk> of the song , the <unk> of the <unk> of every culture .
And it doesn &apos;t matter that the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> .
He was my <unk> of journey in the <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> , on the <unk> , the mother &apos;s <unk> .
All of these <unk> <unk> us that are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways to move around the world .
And if you &apos;re going to be a moment , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> that <unk> the planet , and it &apos;s important for <unk> to the planet as the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> , and you can <unk> the total <unk> of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being from the human imagination .
The <unk> is the great <unk> of humanity .
And that &apos;s the <unk> of what we can be as <unk> species .
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all the species was or is on the <unk> of the <unk> just because it &apos;s <unk> , or -- in the <unk> of the <unk> diversity -- and not even <unk> <unk> -- that &apos;s not <unk> <unk> <unk> -- that we &apos;re going to be <unk> <unk> -- that <unk> diversity .
The <unk> of that is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not only <unk> by a <unk> or a series of <unk> rules .
One language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle with the <unk> that the <unk> of every culture is in the world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we are sitting here at least half , at least half not <unk> in the <unk> of the kids .
They &apos;re not <unk> to children , the <unk> , which is not <unk> to <unk> something , which are already <unk> .
What &apos;s more <unk> of being <unk> by the <unk> , of being the last to talk about a language , of the last being <unk> , or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of somebody in some of the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> , and it <unk> with them in the <unk> <unk> .
And I know that somebody you say , &quot; <unk> &apos;t that ?
The world would not be a better place if you <unk> all the same language ? &quot; <unk> , then we &apos;re all <unk> . &quot;
<unk> <unk> .
And you &apos;re going to have to be able to talk about their language .
I &apos;d love to make you a journey through the <unk> --
And a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we &apos;re going to do .
Many of us , I think , &quot; different ways to <unk> , I mean , I really want different ways to <unk> .
So , for example , this <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> that &apos;s not able to <unk> the blue color from the green because the time <unk> is <unk> in the forest , which we &apos;re <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a rule , <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; You have to <unk> a different person .
And all of that has been <unk> in the past <unk> , though , the <unk> is that in these <unk> families , where you &apos;re talking about to you &apos;re or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> nobody <unk> .
You <unk> to hear and then <unk> to talk .
I &apos;m going to have a <unk> of the most interesting <unk> that I &apos;ve lived , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , a incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> a contact <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;ve made <unk> by the <unk> photographs that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> had never seen anything .
They &apos;ve <unk> the picture from the ground , they <unk> to <unk> a form or a <unk> , and they didn &apos;t <unk> anything , they <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with the <unk> .
But <unk> not only <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> in their <unk> .
<unk> percent of the death was <unk> by their own .
We &apos;re <unk> at eight <unk> and found two cases of natural death and when we <unk> to know , they &apos;ve <unk> that one of them was so that he died , and then they <unk> it . And then they <unk> it . And then they <unk> it . They <unk> it .
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species .
I was first 80 , I was <unk> a really interesting task when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> between the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
To give a sense of <unk> , I should have to understand the <unk> culture and that &apos;s not <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s rather than a <unk> view of the world .
Very interesting .
If you &apos;re going to <unk> the big <unk> of the world , what would you do ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that Africa is not <unk> <unk> . And instead of <unk> is not the other than the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes the interesting <unk> is the <unk> of life and death .
So <unk> make <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of live in so that it &apos;s the <unk> .
For this <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> go to <unk> to <unk> to talk about God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . &quot;
And the moment you &apos;re <unk> , is the spirit that <unk> you , how can you get <unk> ?
So , you &apos;re going to see these incredible events : <unk> in <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather <unk> than the power of the mind when it was <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to <unk> all the <unk> that I &apos;ve lived the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> civilization that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> never was <unk> by <unk> .
In <unk> today are <unk> by a <unk> , but their <unk> is extraordinary .
The young <unk> are <unk> by <unk> families to three or four years , and they &apos;re <unk> in a world &apos;s <unk> and <unk> in a world &apos;s <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> of nine years old <unk> by the way to <unk> the nine months of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of the mother , now I &apos;m <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
For this time , they &apos;re <unk> to <unk> their own society , values that <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And so , in this incredible <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> out and for the first time in their life , at age of 18 , they see a <unk> . And in that moment of <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> , everything that they learned in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , everything that they learned in <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> :
&quot; <unk> , how did I said .
It &apos;s <unk> . Now it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
They call <unk> more <unk> and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think about <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> history of the <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> in his <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are more <unk> to the Earth .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> <unk> <unk> .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> , but because of the <unk> <unk> , but because of the time and <unk> , have created a <unk> of the Earth &apos;s <unk> not about the <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> : the concept that the Earth can only live because it &apos;s <unk> by human <unk> .
What does it mean ?
And I mean that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> that <unk> the mountain is going to be a very different <unk> and has a very different relationship with the mountain or that is a very mountain <unk> that <unk> that a mountain is a <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
That &apos;s a <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> is <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
That made me a human being different from my friends , who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If we were trying to <unk> that these <unk> can create different reality , we start to start understand some of their <unk> <unk> . They <unk> this <unk> .
I &apos;ve been <unk> this picture in <unk> in the <unk> .
You might have heard about the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> .
What makes it fascinating is not the potential <unk> is the <unk> potential , but the <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> by two elements .
On the one side , this <unk> <unk> that <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the only <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little <unk> that <unk> a little <unk> that <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> with a <unk> family &apos;s family &apos;s <unk> said <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you &apos;re going to see the <unk> <unk> <unk> that make from a different <unk> of species , <unk> <unk> it .
And that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea <unk> . <unk> &apos;t make a <unk> of reality .
I often think about my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> was <unk> , with his <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> , you can &apos;t be <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you &apos;re done , because if you &apos;re not done any <unk> . <unk> <unk> , but they can &apos;t be <unk> because I &apos;m <unk> by a <unk> that &apos;s <unk> in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s possible to <unk> only if we could <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now , the <unk> -- the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> of <unk> , the same kind of <unk> , the same kind of <unk> <unk> . The question <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> species , how do these <unk> <unk> <unk> , they do <unk> <unk> , they make these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , they make a <unk> version that &apos;s <unk> <unk> ?
We use the big <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you <unk> to the <unk> , we &apos;re going to be <unk> . &quot;
What does it mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , who <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that our eyes are <unk> in the forest , and our eyes are going to be <unk> in the forest .
If you <unk> it as they <unk> their <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; You know , you don &apos;t know everything ? &quot; I said , &quot;
The solution is : <unk> <unk> <unk> in a <unk> at night with the <unk> and <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
And with that , you know , with that , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> .
Now , &#91; the &#93; problem is that even the ones that have to heart <unk> them , but somehow <unk> to the history of our real world as the <unk> of our real world as the real world of our real world , and over .
In fact , the <unk> century , between 300 years , not <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk> , but rather like the <unk> was where we <unk> and <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> diversity and <unk> the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All of the <unk> were <unk> in a new <unk> for new possibility of life .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> and <unk> like that <unk> didn &apos;t have <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s not change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It &apos;s the power .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And if you look at the world , you know , you know , you know , they &apos;re not <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of the existence of <unk> forces that go beyond their ability to <unk> .
And I think that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> , a <unk> that has been <unk> in the forest until a generation ago , and now <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
I started to <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> .
If we <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the <unk> <unk> of politics .
As <unk> <unk> , the <unk> physics of a <unk> , is <unk> at the <unk> level , but the <unk> , the <unk> of a <unk> , not only is not <unk> , but it &apos;s not <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> in certain <unk> because it &apos;s part of the development of development .
And you can &apos;t understand the <unk> of <unk> until you go from the beginning .
I have the <unk> miles from <unk> in China through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> <unk> to <unk> me what there is behind the <unk> that I realized what there is behind .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father &apos;s father was <unk> at the <unk> <unk> .
That means that it was <unk> to be <unk> at the time of Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk> .
And it was brought to <unk> at age in <unk> at age , and he was <unk> his <unk> because he didn &apos;t have to live without him .
The <unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> .
One day he <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to work for seven years .
<unk> <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of <unk> is by <unk> .
And then finally , all of it <unk> to a choice .
How do you live in the <unk> world or we want to <unk> the world of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died said that his greatest fear was said that , in our <unk> <unk> vision of the world , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination to a human imagination at a <unk> <unk> of thinking , but a day we <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that were going to be <unk> <unk> that were there were other possibilities .
And it &apos;s <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , which <unk> us <unk> , which <unk> us <unk> to the <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , by creating the <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has to <unk> 300 years .
The <unk> story didn &apos;t <unk> me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we &apos;re going to go .
When these <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> <unk> different .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of being what we are : a <unk> species , which has to make it so that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are big moments of <unk> .
I &apos;ve been <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> island , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> me , he <unk> me , he <unk> the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The government didn &apos;t always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> <unk> for <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
The family , <unk> for his life , <unk> all the <unk> away all of the <unk> , and all of his <unk> .
You know , you know , the <unk> don &apos;t <unk> the cold , the <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> were made of fish .
The <unk> of this man didn &apos;t <unk> from the night or the <unk> that <unk> .
And it &apos;s <unk> away , they <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> in their hand . When I did I <unk> , he <unk> , he <unk> it by <unk> , and <unk> by doing a <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> created a <unk> , has <unk> another dog , and it &apos;s <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> talk to <unk> with nothing ?
<unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to <unk> the total <unk> <unk> control of a larger area of <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s their new <unk> . It &apos;s called <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s all the <unk> resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , to end , I think it &apos;s quite <unk> at least who &apos;s been in these <unk> areas of the planet , <unk> that we can &apos;t be <unk> at all .
For somebody &apos;s house .
And we have to <unk> the human imagination that we &apos;re going to be <unk> in the <unk> of the time . And for us all of our kids , become part of the hope .
And so we &apos;re going to end up , we &apos;re <unk> that <unk> never <unk> .
I think that <unk> --
&#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; , but we believe that stories can change the world , and perhaps we are the best <unk> to tell stories of the world . Every month our <unk> site . Every month our <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public places in <unk> to <unk> our public places that are <unk> away from how they saw and , <unk> , <unk> <unk> for time the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> world , and we have to find a <unk> life in the <unk> world , and we have to find a <unk> world &apos;s <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> ,
where we &apos;re <unk> to all the <unk> can <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I &apos;ve written in this book that I hope you &apos;ve already heard and <unk> some <unk> <unk> , in case , not <unk> them .
I want to start with what I call &quot; the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> of what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> society . The <unk> <unk> <unk> : &quot; If we want to <unk> our citizens . &quot; The way to do it is <unk> the freedom . &quot;
The reason is , on one side in the fact that the freedom is <unk> itself , is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> for humans .
And so , it &apos;s what if we are <unk> , each of us can do everything that we can do everything that <unk> our <unk> , without any <unk> that we would have to do everything that we call our <unk> .
The way to <unk> the freedom is <unk> choice .
The more choices people have , more <unk> , and more is their <unk> , and more <unk> , is their <unk> .
This , <unk> , it &apos;s so <unk> in society that nobody was <unk> in <unk> .
And it &apos;s also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made .
This is my <unk> . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to have a simple note about <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> that nobody has already <unk> .
That &apos;s what the <unk> is .
And then you go to the <unk> store for a <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there &apos;s a big number of <unk> <unk> .
We can do six million different <unk> and a half a different <unk> that there are in only one store .
<unk> <unk> that there is choice .
<unk> : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the <unk> services , who were <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , not <unk> it .
A <unk> of that , in the other , was that the phone never <unk> .
These days they went .
We have a <unk> <unk> <unk> , especially between <unk> .
That &apos;s cell phones .
My <unk> is the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
If you don &apos;t have seen it in the store , you &apos;re very soon going to get your house , you &apos;re very soon .
And what happens is that people get in the <unk> and make this question . And you know , it &apos;s the answer ? The answer is , &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t make things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , is <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> , no longer than the United States you &apos;re <unk> from <unk> and the <unk> you have to do .
Instead , I &apos;m going to go , and the <unk> says , &quot; OK , we could do . &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> these and these <unk> . &quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
You know , &quot; <unk> , what would you do ? &quot;
And the <unk> says , &quot; At these <unk> and these <unk> , and <unk> <unk> these <unk> , and <unk> these <unk> . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you said , &quot; You know , if she was me , what would you say ? &quot;
And the <unk> , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
And the result we call it &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> that makes it look like a great thing .
But in fact , it &apos;s not a <unk> the weight and the responsibility for somebody who knows something , <unk> the <unk> , <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> , to another one that doesn &apos;t know -- and it &apos;s not in the <unk> to make decisions the patient .
There &apos;s a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me and you , if you think , you think , if you think it &apos;s not any sense , because we can &apos;t <unk> .
But if we can &apos;t <unk> , why do we <unk> them ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> that we call the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
And so fundamental as it is our <unk> , it &apos;s a question of choice , as you see in this <unk> . &quot; We don &apos;t want to <unk> the <unk> . We don &apos;t want to <unk> a <unk> . <unk> : we have to <unk> it .
And we can <unk> how many times we do .
That means that every <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
And the family and <unk> , a time perspective , <unk> , <unk> almost for anyone , was that you <unk> the most soon as possible , and they were able to get kids to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get the <unk> .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not even what to do after .
<unk> , it &apos;s really really to play .
They &apos;re going to work very smart , and they &apos;re 20 percent in less work with a time .
And because they &apos;re not <unk> , because they &apos;re not <unk> , because they &apos;re not <unk> .
But why I &apos;m <unk> , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; <unk> <unk> , or no ? <unk> do that now ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> later ? I have to think before kids or career ? &quot;
I &apos;m <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this <unk> doesn &apos;t <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and not get a great <unk> to my <unk> .
And they have to do it . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the work : we &apos;re <unk> , because the technology allows us to work every minute , every day , every day , from every corner of the planet , <unk> that from <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> , and I &apos;m not going to tell you what <unk> works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What does that mean , this incredible choice of choice we have about the work ? That &apos;s that we have to decide , <unk> at all right time , if we have to work or no .
We can go to see our son to play <unk> , with the <unk> in a <unk> , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> , on the <unk> .
And even though they &apos;re all <unk> , every minute that we see our son <unk> , we &apos;re also <unk> , &quot; What do I do I have to answer this called &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this <unk> ? I have to <unk> this letter ? &quot;
And when the answer is , &quot; no , this makes the experience of your son , very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the things we look at , little <unk> , things , life is a question of choices .
And once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibility , but it wasn &apos;t a question of choice .
The world &apos;s world today to <unk> this : The <unk> is , &quot; Is it a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? &quot;
The answer is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> all know we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the <unk> .
And we have this choice <unk> two effects of people .
The first , <unk> , is that it <unk> instead .
With a lot of <unk> that you choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I &apos;m going to show you a <unk> example : a <unk> study on <unk> <unk> .
And a <unk> , it had access to the data , the <unk> society , the <unk> society , with about a million <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> in more , the <unk> <unk> <unk> of two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s 10 percent in less than it &apos;s <unk> to <unk> , when they &apos;re only available to five . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> where we choose , is to <unk> , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And <unk> , and again , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , and <unk> , of course , <unk> , and <unk> , and of course , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , and <unk> , of course , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
And <unk> that doesn &apos;t mean just this <unk> <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don &apos;t have enough money , it &apos;s so <unk> that <unk> <unk> the <unk> of work .
They &apos;re not going to be <unk> until five <unk> for a year from the <unk> of work , which would be <unk> to <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of having choices .
And I think that &apos;s going to be the world .
&quot; And to end , to end the <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> ? &quot;
You know , you know , if it &apos;s the right decision , is it ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and you &apos;re going to <unk> the wrong <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even though we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice , at the end is less <unk> by the end of how we were <unk> with less <unk> than we choose .
And that &apos;s for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of <unk> between what you choose , if you &apos;re not perfect , and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that it could be better . And what happens is that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> choice , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> decision to <unk> the decision that <unk> us to <unk> <unk> the decision that decision , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> decision ,
even when it was a decision .
The more choices there are more easy to <unk> any <unk> that &apos;s <unk> of choice .
And , there &apos;s what <unk> call <unk> .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well , very well , very well , very well , very <unk> , very well , very well , very <unk> how we do .
And you know , when there are a lot of possible , it &apos;s easy to <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> to be <unk> .
So here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m going to <unk> with all the ones that are not in New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably .
There &apos;s this <unk> to <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It &apos;s all about them .
But what he thinks it &apos;s thinks , &quot; Well , what he thinks , it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; All of my <unk> to <unk> are <unk> . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> just in front of home . &quot;
And it &apos;s going to be two weeks from the idea that &apos;s <unk> -- every day -- the possibility of <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> the <unk> for what we &apos;ve got , even when we choice was <unk> .
And the <unk> that we have <unk> , the more <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> .
Here &apos;s another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
We live the time , and maybe it &apos;s about living .
But the most important point is that anything you want to <unk> , you &apos;re not going to be <unk> .
The things that don &apos;t <unk> to make a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> point : <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a couple of <unk> .
It &apos;s going to be <unk> .
And once the <unk> were just one kind of <unk> them and <unk> <unk> , they were <unk> , only after <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of times , <unk> , <unk> to go to the <unk> .
So , I started to <unk> a couple new when the <unk> were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . &quot;
And the <unk> said , &quot; You want to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
I want them to <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> them want to <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> them want to <unk> them , or <unk> <unk> -- &quot; <unk> <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a little bit I could say , &quot; I want the guy that was the only kind of <unk> had no idea what it was , so on a <unk> time . I &apos;m all <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , then <unk> out of the <unk> store , and then <unk> out of the <unk> store , and then I had ever been <unk> .
It was <unk> . With all that choice I had to do the best .
But I &apos;m going to <unk> .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that with all of that choice , my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn &apos;t <unk> anything to do when I was just one like , but when I got 100 different , <unk> , at least a very different guy had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After I was <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in life of people don &apos;t make the <unk> that these have <unk> <unk> that have <unk> <unk> that these have <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And this is <unk> less <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the <unk> world if it makes it .
Because if you <unk> , I &apos;m not talking about .
The truth is more to this .
&quot; You know , it was better when you were worse . &quot; The reason you were worse when you were worse , it was even worse .
<unk> , in the world that we live in -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that the things are <unk> .
You &apos;ve never been <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; Yes , you want to do it . &quot;
I mean -- a little <unk> moment -- that I &apos;m really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn &apos;t have any better , I &apos;m not <unk> .
But <unk> isn &apos;t a <unk> thing .
And I &apos;m going to be a <unk> <unk> when there &apos;s only that kind of <unk> is that when you &apos;re not <unk> , and you &apos;re going to say , &quot; Why ? &quot;
Who is <unk> ? &quot; The answer is <unk> .
The world is <unk> . What can I do ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of <unk> , and you &apos;re going to <unk> a <unk> , and you &apos;ll find who is <unk> , it &apos;s clear that the <unk> you are .
You could have a better way .
With hundreds of <unk> available , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people get decisions , even though the result is <unk> , they <unk> and give them the <unk> and give them to them .
In the last few years , the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world .
I think that a <unk> <unk> -- not the only one , but -- of this <unk> <unk> of <unk> is just that people have <unk> experiences because the <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation think that <unk> is their own .
So the end result is that in general is that we &apos;re better , but we &apos;re going to be worse .
I &apos;m going to show you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all do for good and it &apos;s completely <unk> . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no <unk> that a little bit better choice is not going to <unk> at all , but from this is not going to be a lot better .
There &apos;s a <unk> value , <unk> . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve been <unk> from a piece of the level that the choices that the choices <unk> our life .
Now , from the <unk> view -- I &apos;ve almost finished -- from the point of view , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What allows all of this choice in <unk> society is the <unk> <unk> .
There are a lot of places in the world , and you &apos;re going to be <unk> , where the problem is not that have <unk> choice .
The problem is that they have too much .
So the <unk> I &apos;m talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> has been talking about yesterday about how those <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> of money .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , not that &apos;s just <unk> .
I &apos;m <unk> <unk> .
They do have worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows us to be <unk> in those where people are too much <unk> , it &apos;s not only their life to <unk> , but also our life to <unk> .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income does well , not only to the poor -- not only with the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we &apos;re going to be <unk> .
And so , &quot; You can become everything you want to be --
<unk> , people in culture , <unk> , &quot; But what <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s <unk> that you can &apos;t make anything in a glass <unk> . &quot;
&quot; <unk> imagination , a <unk> vision of the world -- &quot;
And I <unk> it so , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I realized that the fish know that the long knows the long knows .
Because the reality of fact , you know , if you <unk> the <unk> , so that &quot; all of it is possible . You &apos;re <unk> the <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> so that we could <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
They all need a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
