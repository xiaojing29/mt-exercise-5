<unk> year I showed these <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for about three million years had the <unk> <unk> of the United States , <unk> , <unk> percent .
I &apos;m going to <unk> this <unk> of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a way , the heart <unk> of global warming .
It <unk> <unk> and <unk> of summer .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You see , you know , <unk> <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That &apos;s the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> in summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , of five years or more , it &apos;s like the blood , which here is <unk> from the body .
In 25 years it went on for 25 years , so .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> around the ocean <unk> where there are enormous <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> , <unk> , are <unk> by the <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> by global <unk> , the amount of <unk> , which is not <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> is already <unk> by the water .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> team at last <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! Al <unk> : She &apos;s good . The question is , if we <unk> it ,
One reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> from the north .
This is a river in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> never <unk> to the <unk> levels .
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you want to know how the <unk> level of the sea level to <unk> on <unk> , here is where the sea is where the sea is going on .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> on the planet : <unk> , the biggest <unk> of ice on the planet .
<unk> month scientists have <unk> that the ice <unk> is in <unk> , and that the Western <unk> , which <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> at six feet of <unk> , like in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the third largest <unk> of ice , you see <unk> , which few years ago were <unk> .
<unk> percent of the world population <unk> <unk> water from that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : this <unk> is the source of water <unk> of this city .
The <unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same happens to <unk> water .
In California , <unk> on <unk> <unk> is <unk> percent .
<unk> <unk> are in crisis .
<unk> , as you read , are <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in the world leads to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> to a normal <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> times more than the last 30 years of <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the whole <unk> .
If you look in the <unk> context , you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we &apos;ve <unk> 70 million <unk> of <unk> every day . 25 million <unk> in the ocean every day .
Look at <unk> the area of the <unk> <unk> , from <unk> , to <unk> , and on both the parts of the <unk> <unk> , where there is a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean .
The biggest cause of global warming , together with <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of two countries with more emissions , with China .
And you can build a lot of other <unk> <unk> .
But we &apos;re starting a <unk> of direction .
These are the <unk> projects over the last few years and some <unk> of <unk> .
Every way , there &apos;s a political <unk> in our country .
The <unk> of <unk> and oil have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to <unk> something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it on the <unk> .
This is the biggest flow of <unk> in America .
It &apos;s successful around <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> â™« <unk> <unk> is a <unk> and happy .
It &apos;s here in America , and it &apos;s <unk> our economy .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Al <unk> : <unk> here is a lot of <unk> <unk> .
The greatest <unk> society on the <unk> <unk> is <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> Al <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- no know what they &apos;re talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , one part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> , we see <unk> change in a <unk> <unk> in our business .
So , we have a great amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> the truth .
Actually , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it &apos;s <unk> -- it &apos;s also a good <unk> .
So , we don &apos;t have to <unk> climate change .
We can do it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you &apos;ve heard about it a lot of it .
So I &apos;m going to <unk> a <unk> structure as well as <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> machines are a little <unk> , but this is the sound of <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> is between the main <unk> of global warming , but the <unk> technology that you see changes .
Let &apos;s look at this : this is the <unk> <unk> technology .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic and the national security .
<unk> : <unk> : America is in the crisis ; the economy , <unk> , <unk> crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all of : our <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and oil <unk> .
Now , there &apos;s a new <unk> , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan for <unk> America to work , <unk> more <unk> , and help <unk> the global warming .
<unk> , a solution that we can solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
Al <unk> : This is the last .
<unk> : <unk> : This is <unk> power .
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> to the <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , sun , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> <unk> two : <unk> <unk> for jobs well .
<unk> : <unk> America . It &apos;s time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A <unk> <unk> <unk> says , &quot; If you want to go alone .
If you want to go far , go . &quot;
We have to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED I made a <unk> on <unk> .
And I &apos;m trying to <unk> on how the machine works .
So I &apos;m going to go . And for those who was the other time not there , the <unk> was the greatest experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> kilometers of <unk> .
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were in the <unk> of the universe -- to <unk> million times a second .
And all of that is simply <unk> .
This is the machine <unk> .
<unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk> .
This is what I work on . It &apos;s called <unk> -- is <unk> <unk> feet . And it &apos;s a <unk> feet .
This is a <unk> picture of <unk> in construction . And so you can see the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> last year , we <unk> the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> of particles that had done all the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles inside the <unk> .
In other words , when I <unk> that image the 10 <unk> , I would <unk> that the <unk> machine , which is a great <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if this was to make <unk> more or this , when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that page was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a <unk> impact on this scientific impact .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the car , had to just these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> of <unk> .
Now , the <unk> of you <unk> <unk> and <unk> , &quot; It &apos;s not true . I &apos;m <unk> too <unk> . &quot;
And they can do it because when they &apos;re very <unk> to become the <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees , at a temperature temperature <unk> to that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and <unk> about 30 <unk> .
They have about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We have them <unk> and <unk> .
Now they &apos;re <unk> all right into their <unk> .
<unk> the end of <unk> the end of <unk> <unk> ,
I <unk> it , and we try to get data <unk> or <unk> , and on so our <unk> to find out what the <unk> are going to be .
Now , of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering <unk> . It &apos;s easy to <unk> .
I think that &apos;s so hard , the fact of going on the <unk> , I think is this value of things like <unk> .
I &apos;d like to end with the words of a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which , in <unk> of <unk> experiments of human mind , and his <unk> was Michael <unk> , said , &quot; No , it &apos;s a lot of <unk> for human mind how <unk> that ideas of science are <unk> , that there are no <unk> in nature , that our <unk> are <unk> , and that our <unk> are <unk> . &quot; And that are not <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> <unk> when , from children , <unk> with <unk> .
<unk> like <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , actually <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that most of the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with objects , with my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and started <unk> , I started <unk> . I started <unk> : &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having the <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> a information with both with both hands ,
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that I was <unk> to explore the answer , building <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> with your hand , they can <unk> with their own movement and hear their movement and they have a screen and they <unk> <unk> .
But <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> .
The <unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> the digital information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement , other people , and as as <unk> as they become <unk> , <unk> of the movement , and so on the movement , and we can explore new <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
Let &apos;s start with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you of the video . If you put it in one direction , the <unk> video , so if you <unk> on the other side back .
These <unk> are <unk> of other people .
If you <unk> them , you know what it &apos;s them around .
If they come up , they <unk> it and they can <unk> it a little bit .
If they come up , they <unk> it and they can <unk> it a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We then realized that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was the <unk> that we could use common data on data , for example , which is a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> like <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> color in the middle of the <unk> , where you <unk> .
and I can <unk> color in that central color , where you <unk> .
And you get too much . We can <unk> a little bit .
There are also <unk> possibility of <unk> , like <unk> , <unk> and math and <unk> where people can try things quickly , and <unk> the results are immediately .
Now I &apos;m going to ...
This is a <unk> sequence I &apos;m doing with a <unk> program .
Here we have a game of words that is in half between <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> , a letter in <unk> , on every <unk> , <unk> , at every <unk> , and while <unk> of <unk> , and while <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds <unk> , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibility of trying to .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the <unk> children in <unk> <unk> , I made so I made them and I <unk> them and I <unk> a video .
They &apos;re very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things like this is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just wanted to say , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , right there .
It actually wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I could build a tool for the <unk> of <unk> . He &apos;s <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now , he brought a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! Yeah !
So , we <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It &apos;s a <unk> story . And it can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : It &apos;s a <unk> story . And it can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> away , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I &apos;ve got time to show you is a <unk> , I recently made to <unk> and <unk> music .
It &apos;s a <unk> , <unk> recently , to <unk> and <unk> music .
The <unk> here is <unk> by <unk> like basic , low and <unk> .
<unk> of these has four different <unk> , and you can use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of your <unk> .
And I just <unk> by making a <unk> <unk> and a sequence .
These are effects that you can control from , like <unk> and <unk> .
They <unk> it to a particular <unk> and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are <unk> effects as time and <unk> , which is <unk> to the whole sequence .
<unk> how it works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; sequence , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , another <unk> .
Now I &apos;m going to put a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I &apos;m going to <unk> <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> : And I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> , so I can control the <unk> , so I can control the live effect .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the entire sequence of time from one side or another .
<unk> : <unk> : And now I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> to give <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the <unk> &quot; <unk> . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> it , <unk> a long time .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the entire sequence on the left the <unk> &quot; <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new <unk> <unk> <unk> in how our brain work and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibility that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to <unk> is that <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> media , which <unk> information in our world the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and <unk> of my life .
And I don &apos;t look like that .
But , I said that something particular happened in my life and in my life , which led me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I wrote this book , this <unk> called &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which , <unk> , &quot; which , <unk> , &quot; my <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And the result is that everywhere I &apos;m going to people like me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I &apos;m going to <unk> all the <unk> and say , &quot; You don &apos;t <unk> to be able to do better ?
You don &apos;t <unk> to go out and write all life without being able to create a book that can help someone ? &quot;
<unk> to someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , except I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I was <unk> to say to people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
I was <unk> to the same <unk> <unk> by fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you know how to have success ? &quot;
Are you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you ?
You don &apos;t <unk> to do this <unk> all of life without any <unk> that you &apos;ve ever come out and die on a <unk> of <unk> dreams with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yeah , I &apos;m afraid of all of those things .
I &apos;ve always been afraid .
And I also <unk> of many other things that people could not be <unk> .
Like <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as I &apos;m writing the writing one of the <unk> I thought and <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It &apos;s <unk> that anybody who <unk> to be <unk> by a work that you &apos;re born for a work that you can feel to do .
But what &apos;s so particular about the <unk> <unk> that we have <unk> <unk> about health <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not ?
Like my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I don &apos;t remember one time in his <unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where you were asked if you were afraid to be <unk> ?
It never -- that <unk> of <unk> John , like that ?
<unk> &apos;t you like that , <unk> ?
<unk> , the engineers <unk> like <unk> have no certainly , in <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
We have enough , we have enough this <unk> , and not just <unk> but <unk> of all of these <unk> , we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk> .
And so , not somebody else who look at the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often as they .
And even those who don &apos;t seem to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before I die , <unk> said , &quot; Every my book <unk> me a little more <unk> about the work of its own life .
But we don &apos;t know <unk> when we would say it because we &apos;ve heard these things so long , we have completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are somehow <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that art , at the end , we always <unk> to the <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> to everybody here today is : you agree with this idea ?
I &apos;m going to <unk> this thing -- because even <unk> from a <unk> distance to me not OK .
I think it &apos;s <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s also <unk> and I don &apos;t want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better <unk> our <unk> <unk> to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- in my situation , would be very <unk> to start <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> that I &apos;m in my career .
<unk> -- look at it , I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;m a <unk> , I &apos;ve been a <unk> .
I &apos;ve got about four <unk> of work in me .
And it &apos;s very <unk> that whatever <unk> of now in the world , as the work that I would <unk> after <unk> , I would <unk> it , <unk> success of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we &apos;re all about friends here -- is <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , what thought !
You know , this is the kind of thought that leads you to <unk> a person to start <unk> at nine <unk> in the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I could continue doing this work I love .
So , the question becomes , how about
And so , I think , after many <unk> , that the way to work on and write is to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to be able to find a distance between me , which I &apos;m <unk> , and my natural <unk> on what the <unk> wrote . And as I was <unk> about <unk> <unk> . And as I was doing it , trying to find other people to see if they were able to find other <unk> ideas and more <unk> .
how to help people <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research led me to the <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
because they were <unk> in <unk> and then <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don &apos;t believe that <unk> creativity from men , OK ?
It turns out that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from one <unk> and <unk> , for <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , I decided to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from a <unk> .
The <unk> were the same idea , but they <unk> that sort of <unk> with a <unk> .
which is <unk> , because the <unk> don &apos;t really understand that a <unk> was particularly smart .
And I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> that <unk> literally <unk> of an artist &apos;s study , a bit like the <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;m <unk> out to <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the <unk> of that work .
<unk> <unk> , that &apos;s the distance I &apos;m talking about -- that <unk> <unk> you from your work .
And everyone thought that was so <unk> , right ?
So , the <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like , for example , not ?
If your work was <unk> not to <unk> <unk> the whole <unk> , everybody would have been <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it wasn &apos;t all your <unk> , right ?
<unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> this great idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe on all the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> creatures that <unk> out of the <unk> .
This was the <unk> principle of <unk> <unk> and people to think that <unk> creativity completely from the <unk> .
And for the first time , it <unk> to <unk> to <unk> this or the artist as a <unk> <unk> , a person with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think that &apos;s a simple person , a simple person to believe being a <unk> like the source , the source , the <unk> and the <unk> of all <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s like to someone to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and completely <unk> the <unk> and <unk> all of these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in 500 years .
And if that &apos;s true , and I think it &apos;s going to be , and I think it &apos;s going to be , and I think it &apos;s going to be , and I think it &apos;s going to be , and I think it &apos;s going to be , and I think it &apos;s going to be , and I think it &apos;s going to be , and I think it &apos;s going to be , and I think it &apos;s going to be , and I think it &apos;s true
Can we do it <unk> ?
I could go back to a <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t 500 years of <unk> thinking in a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of , <unk> , <unk> , do you <unk> people to <unk> <unk> on their projects .
I &apos;m probably not going to <unk> you all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to <unk> is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t we <unk> this way ?
Because more sense of everything I &apos;ve ever heard about to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process .
A process that , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so basically , everyone here -- knows , you don &apos;t know <unk> .
And , in fact , it can sometimes look completely <unk> .
I made this <unk> <unk> with the amazing <unk> <unk> , who has now 90 years , but it was a <unk> for all life and told me that during his <unk> <unk> , and he said that during his <unk> <unk> , and <unk> it , in the fields , and I <unk> it , in the fields , and I would <unk> the <unk> .
And he said , he was like a <unk> <unk> of air .
And what I &apos;m going to <unk> to her from the <unk> .
They <unk> it , because it would <unk> the earth under its feet .
I decided to have one thing to do to do at that point , and it was , &quot; <unk> as a <unk> . &quot;
And so I went back home and he was <unk> by this <unk> , and he wouldn &apos;t have any more than taking a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> on the page .
<unk> times , not to be <unk> fast , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> them and <unk> her <unk> through her <unk> and she would <unk> through the <unk> , looking at how she said , &quot; another <unk> . &quot;
Then there were those times -- this piece of the time -- there were no moments when the <unk> was almost <unk> , OK ?
So , he was <unk> at home and he was looking at paper and <unk> the <unk> through , and he was looking at a <unk> , and then he said , he was like , he was like , if he <unk> with the other hand and <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> and <unk> into his body and <unk> into his body and <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the page <unk> and <unk> , but <unk> , from the last word to the first word .
So when I <unk> <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not all my <unk> process -- I &apos;m not a <unk> .
I &apos;m a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; I &apos;m <unk> every day and I work and <unk> and <unk> to work and <unk> and <unk> to work and <unk> on it .
But even I , in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I &apos;m also going to be that many of you the <unk> .
You know , even if I work and ideas I <unk> myself from a certain source I could not be <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> to it in a way that we don &apos;t have the head , but rather , <unk> it &apos;s <unk> us ?
As far as I think , the best example , which I &apos;ve <unk> is the <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;ve <unk> several years ago for a <unk> .
I &apos;m talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> artist &apos;s <unk> , trying to control , <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> totally <unk> .
But then <unk> , <unk> , and one day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , <unk> it .
<unk> <unk> , and everything <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> , which is in its head as <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , you know , it &apos;s amazing , and the <unk> , but it doesn &apos;t know how to <unk> .
It &apos;s not a piece of paper , it has no <unk> , it has no <unk> .
So it starts to hear this kind of old <unk> <unk> in him , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose it from this <unk> song .
I &apos;m not <unk> enough and I can &apos;t <unk> . &quot;
And instead of going to go to <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> the whole process and made something completely new .
I just <unk> the sky and said , &quot; <unk> , you don &apos;t see I &apos;m <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Do it seem to be writing a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you know , you know , you know , if you really want to take care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> more .
<unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And his process <unk> <unk> after this .
Not work , it was still <unk> as always as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> had been <unk> when he <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that outside him <unk> , the <unk> that outside him <unk> , and he would come back where he was , I was , I was , I was , I was , I was , I thought that was <unk> and <unk> .
but I was <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation with <unk> and this thing that was <unk> and <unk> , but it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
So how much I &apos;m going to change a little bit about changing the way I &apos;m going to <unk> and I &apos;ve already <unk> .
This idea , I &apos;m <unk> when I was <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; and <unk> , &quot; and <unk> in one of those <unk> of the <unk> that we &apos;re working on something and we &apos;re not going to be a <unk> , which will be the book <unk> .
Not just <unk> , just the book wrote .
And I started thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I &apos;m <unk> to <unk> that <unk> air and <unk> .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my face to a <unk> corner of the room .
And I said <unk> , &quot; <unk> , what , both of them , and we know that if this book is not going to be <unk> <unk> , I &apos;m not going to be <unk> <unk> , no ?
Because as you see I &apos;m <unk> all I have , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , I don &apos;t do anything .
I &apos;m writing the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to take you to be <unk> that I &apos;m <unk> to do my own part . &quot; Because at the end of the end of the North Africa , the people <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of Africa , the people <unk> to the <unk> of the moon , <unk> and <unk> that will go on for hours and hours to <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every while , I &apos;m <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually were <unk> .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you &apos;ve all got a point , you know , a <unk> like this .
It was like time to <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it wasn &apos;t doing anything different from the usually , like <unk> <unk> <unk> before , but everything was <unk> .
And all of a sudden , not just like a human .
But it <unk> by <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
And when this <unk> , the people would <unk> what was , people would say , you know , you know , you know , when you did that .
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> , when the <unk> <unk> , I <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which , <unk> , &quot; which , you can still hear in <unk> or in <unk> .
In <unk> , when an artist did something impossible , something impossible , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it &apos;s <unk> because we need it .
But , the problem comes the next day , for the same , when you go and <unk> and <unk> that are the 11 of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> it doesn &apos;t have .
It &apos;s simply a <unk> <unk> with a lot of <unk> to <unk> , and maybe never would never be <unk> to the <unk> .
And maybe nobody would say , &quot; What &apos;s the name of God as I &apos;m <unk> , and what do you have to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so <unk> if you can &apos;t believe , <unk> , <unk> , the most <unk> <unk> of your being come from you .
But let me just show you that data from a <unk> of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk> somebody when you &apos;re done .
And , you know , if we think it &apos;s going to change it .
And so I started <unk> , and it &apos;s certainly how I <unk> it for several months in the book that was <unk> soon , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of my success .
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel <unk> by this is , not being <unk> .
Not just your work . I &apos;m going to <unk> your work .
<unk> to your part , any of you can be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , you &apos;ll be <unk> to you <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for one moment through your <unk> , then &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
<unk> , do you do the same <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; to yourself .
I think I think it &apos;s <unk> and I think it &apos;s <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; to yourself , even for <unk> , even for <unk> human love and <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know I &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects about human genome , what <unk> can <unk> and discovery about <unk> genes .
Now we &apos;re going to <unk> a new path : we &apos;ve started <unk> biology and now starting from that digital code we &apos;re <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We always tried to <unk> big questions .
&quot; What is the life ? &quot; is something that most <unk> I think they have <unk> to understand various levels .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> for almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go from the <unk> world of the <unk> world of the computer biology in the digital world .
Now , what about : Can we <unk> life , or create new life on this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> species of the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> a even smaller .
We can <unk> a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> that are here .
But when we look at his <unk> map , it &apos;s <unk> simple than our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at a time , it &apos;s very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell .
So I thought the only way to <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> some of these <unk> questions .
And so we started the <unk> of &quot; Can we <unk> a <unk> ? &quot;
Can <unk> chemistry <unk> to produce these large molecules that we &apos;ve never done before ?
And in case , can we make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is simply a piece of <unk> <unk> material .
The speed of the <unk> that we can <unk> the life is starting to <unk> .
Our ability to write the code , instead of <unk> , <unk> rather slowly , but it &apos;s <unk> .
And our most <unk> results of the <unk> <unk> on a <unk> .
We &apos;ve been over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before experiments .
But we discovered that DNA <unk> is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA <unk> , of 30 to 50 <unk> and it &apos;s a <unk> process : the more <unk> is , the more <unk> , there are .
So we had to develop a new <unk> for <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , starting from information digital information about the <unk> genome .
It &apos;s a little <unk> virus that bacteria .
We designed <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of about <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part of it is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> it in bacteria , the bacteria have <unk> <unk> code and <unk> the <unk> particles .
<unk> particles have <unk> <unk> from cells , are <unk> back and <unk> <unk> .
I talked about recently with <unk> <unk> <unk> that they &apos;ve been doing this model .
They have more <unk> than you .
I think this is a situation where software can really build its own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But I could do the biggest things .
I could build the entire <unk> of <unk> .
They &apos;re more than <unk> <unk> of code .
So we thought we were <unk> in the size of the virus , so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
The <unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> information with <unk> in a computer , they have to be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time , the <unk> <unk> was to <unk> the standard was of a <unk> for every 10 <unk> .
We discovered , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If we were using that original sequence never would be able to work .
One part of the process is design <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of the 50 <unk> to build smaller <unk> than <unk> together .
<unk> elements here .
You probably read that you &apos;ve read that you &apos;ve seen <unk> .
So , we have a <unk> code that <unk> on four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about 20 <unk> , and there &apos;s a <unk> order of <unk> to every <unk> .
So we can use the <unk> code for writing , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did was we did at first .
Some of them have been <unk> by the fact that it was not <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> simply <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started <unk> <unk> with <unk> from five to five to seven <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , we &apos;ve made these <unk> <unk> in <unk> so that we &apos;re trying to create an extremely <unk> <unk> as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to <unk> the process .
So , this looks like a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> .
When I was <unk> to these <unk> <unk> , more than 100 <unk> <unk> , you don &apos;t get <unk> directly into the <unk> .
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> tools of <unk> biology .
So we have <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA .
Here &apos;s an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> like his <unk> <unk> .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it &apos;s <unk> exactly like before .
<unk> of thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms have completely <unk> .
You can live under <unk> .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and it <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
Actually , NASA has shown that this is happening .
This is a picture of the <unk> we built , by simply using the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> them .
This is not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that I &apos;m going to take a time of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we &apos;ve done a little time ago .
They &apos;re more than <unk> <unk> of code .
It &apos;s the greatest <unk> of a <unk> structure that ever <unk> by man .
It has a <unk> weight <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a 10 <unk> without spaces , you will just <unk> pages to <unk> this code .
Now , how do we make it work ? How can we <unk> it ?
Of course , through a virus is a <unk> game .
It &apos;s a little bit more <unk> when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s <unk> cells as well as it is <unk> cells like our : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the <unk> process .
In <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> instead of <unk> in the cell , but we have <unk> <unk> that we are able to do a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> cell to another and <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> species .
The two are different how men from <unk> .
We &apos;ve <unk> some <unk> <unk> more so that they can decide what you &apos;ve got to choose this .
And then he <unk> it with <unk> so that we <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> went into the cell .
And <unk> <unk> that we don &apos;t have to go beyond , but we tried to <unk> more in there .
This is one of the biggest <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere , or a third <unk> somewhere , and <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So who thinks in evolution as a <unk> <unk> at a time , <unk> not <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> DNA .
The <unk> that was in the cell , it didn &apos;t <unk> one .
The <unk> <unk> we <unk> it .
It &apos;s <unk> , and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material , <unk> , and we <unk> with only the cell the cell and the new <unk> .
has become blue <unk> because of the genes we &apos;ve <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species , <unk> , and <unk> of all in a new species , <unk> on the new software that we &apos;ve <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code that <unk> <unk> , exactly what we &apos;ve <unk> you .
Now , this may be <unk> <unk> , but we <unk> the software DNA <unk> we can change things in <unk> enough .
Now , I &apos;ve already <unk> that here is not talking about <unk> -- but about progress from three million years of evolution , and I &apos;ve already said that maybe we &apos;re creating a new version of <unk> <unk> , where we <unk> new species <unk> on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give one example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> ; in <unk> , 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re <unk> now <unk> of food , water and <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for six billion people .
I &apos;m going to have to do it for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> of <unk> .
That means percent of <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process to <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
In more <unk> we need to realize that all the <unk> of CO2 <unk> from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
At the same time , because of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> all over the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that they are the <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry <unk> only one <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here are <unk> data from reality and our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , through these <unk> <unk> of <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think of these 20 million <unk> or <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s simply a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> , <unk> or chemistry or chemistry or chemistry or chemistry , <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> software that we &apos;re working on to be able to <unk> and design and design on the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how to be .
We know exactly how their <unk> code .
Now we &apos;re <unk> on the <unk> of generation of .
You saw you that <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We <unk> on the second and third generation that we &apos;ll be <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> to <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way biology can have a huge impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost of food , before we have been working on design for design that we &apos;re working on to design this , and we think we can have the first <unk> of <unk> <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> solar <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> of <unk> , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> we <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> in the deep ocean , about <unk> feet deep at the temperature of <unk> water .
<unk> <unk> by <unk> by using <unk> hydrogen <unk> as energy .
We &apos;re trying to figure out if we can <unk> CO2 CO2 , which can easily be <unk> through <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to lead this process .
So , <unk> we think we might be able to <unk> what we might be able to <unk> what life is . We have the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole <unk> industry .
<unk> . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t do it from TED .
It &apos;s a major source of energy .
<unk> , we &apos;re working on the same <unk> to create <unk> .
You saw this year with flu , we always back a year and a dollar less when it comes back to find the right .
I think that you can change by building <unk> in <unk> .
So , this is how the future could start to look at <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and finally <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re so <unk> to <unk> people .
Our purpose is to be able to be able to live long enough to try to <unk> . Thank you very much .
<unk> I &apos;m going to show you , the <unk> <unk> possible , some of the new technology that we took to the <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> , almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
It &apos;s a environment in which you can <unk> both of the local level that <unk> with a huge amount of data <unk> .
Here we &apos;re seeing <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> and <unk> , for a <unk> fast , <unk> the images like we want .
And no matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big it <unk> of data or images .
Most of them are common photographs , but this is a <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen . It &apos;s also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a book whole , example of data , not of images .
This is the <unk> <unk> of <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
So , to <unk> that it &apos;s really about images and not of images , we can do something like that , to actually see that it &apos;s a real <unk> <unk> , not a picture .
It could be a way of <unk> to read a <unk> book .
I don &apos;t tell you .
This is a more <unk> example . This is a <unk> example of the <unk> .
Every image of a great image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the beautiful experience of read the real <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> kind of a half .
We also did something with the corner of this <unk> number of The <unk> .
We &apos;ve created a lot of <unk> <unk> much higher than the one uses in a normal <unk> , and we <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And that really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
I &apos;m going to put that <unk> and other <unk> <unk> , not to be <unk> .
Of course , <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And I don &apos;t want to lose time , if we don &apos;t have time , if we don &apos;t have a lot of <unk> .
These are all the streets in the U.S. <unk> <unk> on top image of NASA .
So I &apos;m going to start to something else .
This is actually live on the web ; you can see it .
This is a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other one is a very interesting <unk> <unk> <unk> , a very interesting student of the <unk> of Washington , with the help of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s live on the web , <unk> by <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from one image to another and have this kind of experience of <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of images here actually has a meaning .
The <unk> <unk> of the computer <unk> have <unk> these images together , so that we <unk> to <unk> <unk> where the <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk> . So here &apos;s the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , and these things have been <unk> , and these things have been all <unk> at <unk> level .
I don &apos;t know if I have any time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of <unk> data and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that we &apos;ve done for the first time , the summer <unk> to show what <unk> is really the key <unk> of this technology , <unk> . And it &apos;s not <unk> that we look at the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> <unk> and so on .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of types of types in <unk> , other <unk> and so forth . <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> an image that has been discovered by <unk> this model .
So they &apos;re all <unk> <unk> and have all been <unk> at the level of this way .
And you can <unk> this way .
You know , I would never thought I &apos;d be working on for <unk> .
It &apos;s very <unk> <unk> <unk> here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of <unk> : from those cell phones to those cell phones <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I can <unk> those more <unk> .
A lot of these are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
<unk> here is a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from <unk> to <unk> physics .
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now <unk> data from <unk> <unk> from the whole memory of how we <unk> the earth , from the whole <unk> of <unk> and <unk> all of those data together .
All those pictures become <unk> together , greater than the <unk> of the parts .
You have a model of the Earth &apos;s entire <unk> .
Think of it as a <unk> of <unk> &apos;s work on Earth .
It &apos;s something that <unk> in <unk> complexity that people will <unk> it , and the <unk> for who <unk> it with the use of .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> by other people .
If any of <unk> is this idea of <unk> all of these <unk> <unk> the name , my picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> of all those data , and I can use how to <unk> <unk> to <unk> space in that space , in that <unk> , using the <unk> of anyone else , and having an experience of a <unk> and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of this is extremely <unk> <unk> of every part of the land , and <unk> not only by <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and similar , but from the <unk> .
Thank you very much .
CA : I understood ? What about that your software <unk> us to do is that at one point , in the next few years , all the photographs <unk> from anyone in the world would be <unk> <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is we &apos;re going to discover .
It &apos;s creating <unk> , if you want , in images .
And he &apos;s doing it in the <unk> of the <unk> .
And it becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> information that a lot of these <unk> images .
As you make a <unk> <unk> of images on the web , you <unk> a <unk> and the text page the <unk> of the images .
Now , what happens if that picture <unk> to all your pictures ?
So the amount of <unk> and <unk> <unk> that <unk> is really enormous . It &apos;s a very enormous effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it &apos;s really amazing . <unk> .
<unk> : I &apos;m going to leave you very much .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is the way that we can live in the <unk> , and the <unk> in the wind <unk> , <unk> it into the wind <unk> , <unk> it into the <unk> <unk> of plants .
<unk> to think that <unk> <unk> still beyond the <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> still <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , and that the idea that the world in there is no <unk> , but it &apos;s just a model of reality , but it &apos;s just a model of reality ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , well , or evil , a lot of <unk> .
And of course , everybody <unk> <unk> .
<unk> . <unk> : <unk> . <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
So we need to <unk> the death <unk> , so we don &apos;t like <unk> and <unk> --
We all have an art .
What <unk> is the <unk> <unk> of the song , the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that it &apos;s the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> .
He was my <unk> <unk> of the journey of the <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> in <unk> , on the <unk> , the mother <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
All of these <unk> are <unk> that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you could <unk> a second , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> of the world create a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and <unk> the planet and is important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> note as <unk> .
And you think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the total <unk> of all <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being from being by the human imagination .
The <unk> is the <unk> <unk> of humanity .
It &apos;s the <unk> of what we can be and what we can be as <unk> species .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> was successful at <unk> and <unk> much faster .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all species have been or on the <unk> of <unk> , just because it &apos;s <unk> , or -- in the <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> diversity -- and you don &apos;t even know about the <unk> -- the <unk> diversity .
The <unk> of that is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just a <unk> or a series of <unk> rules .
One language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of the <unk> that <unk> of every culture comes in the material .
Every language is a forest <unk> , a <unk> , a thought , a thought , a <unk> <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , while we &apos;re sitting here at <unk> , at least half not being <unk> in the <unk> of children .
They don &apos;t come to the children , which means , which is less than <unk> something , which are already .
What &apos;s more <unk> than being <unk> by <unk> , of being <unk> by the last language , of the last language , not having a way of <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of children ?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of someone in a part of the world every two weeks : every two weeks a <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk> language .
And I know that some of you say , &quot; <unk> &apos;t it better ?
The world would not be a better place if we <unk> all the same language ? &quot; <unk> , we all talk . &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> of a <unk> thing that means that we can talk about its language .
I &apos;d like to make a journey today through <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we &apos;re <unk> .
A lot of us <unk> that when I say &quot; different ways of <unk> &quot; I mean different ways of <unk> .
And for example , this <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , which <unk> at the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s not able to <unk> the blue color from green because the time <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> of the forest because the <unk> is <unk> in the forest , which we <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> &quot; : you have to <unk> a person talking a different language .
And all of that <unk> in the past <unk> , <unk> is that in these <unk> <unk> that they talk about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> nobody practice ,
You can hear and listen to and then <unk> to talk .
I would take one of the most interesting <unk> I lived with , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , an amazing <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> contact with a <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;ve done <unk> from the top of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> forest <unk> never saw anything .
They <unk> the pictures from the ground , they <unk> the <unk> of a form or a <unk> and , and they don &apos;t know anything , they <unk> that <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with the <unk> .
But the <unk> don &apos;t just have the <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> with each other .
<unk> percent of <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We went to eight <unk> and we found two cases of natural death and when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was so <unk> that he &apos;s dead <unk> , and then they <unk> it . And then they <unk> the same . And then they <unk> the same .
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> species .
<unk> years early &apos; <unk> , I was really interesting , when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> between <unk> society &apos;s <unk> to <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> to use to make <unk> .
To make sense of <unk> , I should have <unk> <unk> culture and <unk> is not <unk> .
It &apos;s a rather than a <unk> view of the world .
<unk> <unk> .
If you were <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the world , what would you like to <unk> ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that Africa <unk> doesn &apos;t have <unk> <unk> . And instead of it is not the other than the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes interesting is that <unk> is the <unk> of the relationship between life and death .
So <unk> do <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> to live in a way that for a short time , the <unk> becomes the <unk> .
So , the <unk> <unk> to say , &quot; <unk> <unk> go to <unk> talking about God .
We go into the <unk> and <unk> God . &quot;
And as you &apos;re <unk> , is the spirit that you have <unk> , how do you <unk> ?
So it &apos;s about these incredible events : <unk> <unk> in the state of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather <unk> of power of the <unk> of the power of the mind when <unk> in a <unk> state of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> that I &apos;ve lived with the most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> civilization <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> never was <unk> by <unk> .
And I &apos;m <unk> by a <unk> , but their education is extraordinary <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> away from <unk> to <unk> or four years , and live in a world that was made of <unk> and <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> of the <unk> years of <unk> the nine months of <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of mother , now are <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
For this time , they come to the values of their society , values that they <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to better say the <unk> <unk> .
And at the end of this incredible <unk> , they come back and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 , and see a <unk> . And in that moment of <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk> , everything that they learned in <unk> , is <unk> all the <unk> <unk> , all they &apos;ve learned in the <unk> . The <unk> <unk> back and says ,
&quot; <unk> ? <unk> as I said .
It &apos;s <unk> . Now it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
They &apos;re called <unk> <unk> <unk> and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think about <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the old story of <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> concept in its <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are closer to Earth than Earth &apos;s us .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by <unk> .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or in <unk> <unk> of <unk> , but <unk> <unk> of time and <unk> , have created a <unk> of Earth <unk> , not on the concept of <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> , the concept that the Earth can only live because it &apos;s <unk> by human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
I mean that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> the mountain is a <unk> <unk> <unk> to be a human <unk> that <unk> is going to be a very different <unk> and has a <unk> different relationship with the mountain or that would <unk> <unk> that <unk> a mountain <unk> to be <unk> .
<unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> to be <unk> .
That made me a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you start to <unk> that these <unk> can create different , we can actually start to understand some of the <unk> of the <unk> .
I took this picture of <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What makes <unk> <unk> is not the potential of the <unk> of <unk> , but its <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> from two elements .
On one hand , this <unk> <unk> that <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> only <unk> <unk> <unk> . You have a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit of the <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> with a <unk> of a <unk> of the family <unk> said <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you ever see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> the <unk> that <unk> <unk> from a different species , <unk> it <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . <unk> &apos;t creates a <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
In my <unk> , you can &apos;t <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you &apos;re done , you can &apos;t tell anybody to be <unk> . <unk> , but they can &apos;t be <unk> <unk> because they &apos;re <unk> by a <unk> that is , of course in the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
You can <unk> <unk> only if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now , it &apos;s the <unk> <unk> that you find in this <unk> are <unk> of <unk> , the same kind of <unk> <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> <unk> species of plants , how these <unk> <unk> two <unk> don &apos;t like that , but if you <unk> it in this way , they create a <unk> that &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> .
But if you go to the <unk> , we <unk> &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
What does it mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , who <unk> <unk> in the forest , and our eyes in the same species .
If you <unk> it as I <unk> their <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> of plants , all of you don &apos;t know everything ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
The solution is : you take the <unk> <unk> in a <unk> of the moon and <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
With that you don &apos;t <unk> to <unk> , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , &#91; <unk> &#93; the problem is that even those of us who have to heart <unk> <unk> them , but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of history of our real world , and <unk> through it .
In fact , the <unk> century , not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk> , but rather like the age of the <unk> or its <unk> <unk> , but rather like the <unk> of <unk> diversity and <unk> or <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> diversity and <unk> of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All the <unk> were <unk> in a new <unk> for a new possibility of life .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> don &apos;t have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> and <unk> and <unk> like <unk> don &apos;t have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s not change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It &apos;s the power .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you look at the world , I would say that these are not <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> creatures and <unk> out of the existence of <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that lived in the forest until a generation ago , and now <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> by the <unk> that seems <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> .
If we go on the <unk> of <unk> , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the <unk> <unk> of politics .
As the <unk> , the <unk> physics of a <unk> , is <unk> at the level of <unk> , but the <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> of a <unk> , not only is <unk> , but <unk> <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it does part of development <unk> .
And you can &apos;t understand the <unk> of <unk> until you go from the beginning .
I <unk> miles <unk> from <unk> in China in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> with a young <unk> <unk> , but only <unk> <unk> <unk> , I realized what I was talking about .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> to the <unk> <unk> .
which means that it was <unk> at the time of Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that led to <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and her <unk> was being <unk> .
It was taken of <unk> in <unk> at the age of two <unk> under his <unk> because he couldn &apos;t live without living on him .
The <unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> .
One day he <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to work for seven years .
The pain of the <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> of <unk> is by <unk> present .
<unk> , all <unk> to a choice .
How about living the world <unk> of <unk> or we want to <unk> the world of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> , before he died said that his greatest fear was , in our <unk> view of the world , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of the world , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination , to a <unk> <unk> of thought , but one day we <unk> us from a <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it &apos;s <unk> that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , who gave us <unk> to <unk> , which has <unk> us to the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world &apos;s <unk> 300 years old .
The story is not <unk> me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we would <unk> to come .
When these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it is to be human , we start with <unk> different <unk> .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all <unk> the chance of being what we are : a <unk> species , which has to <unk> that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are great moments of <unk> moments .
I took this picture on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> island , when I went to <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> me , and this man , <unk> me , <unk> the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The government <unk> isn &apos;t always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> to <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> them .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
The family , <unk> for his life , <unk> <unk> away all the <unk> , and all of his <unk> .
You know , you know , you know , <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> were made of fish <unk> fish .
The <unk> of this man didn &apos;t <unk> at the night or the <unk> that <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> away , it <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did I <unk> them , he <unk> them by them , and he <unk> them by creating a <unk> .
He &apos;s <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> of <unk> and when <unk> <unk> , <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> has created a <unk> , and he <unk> another dog and he &apos;s <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> you talk to <unk> with nothing ? <unk> . And this , in different ways , &#91; <unk> &#93; is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> the government <unk> <unk> to the <unk> control of an area of <unk> larger California and <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s their new <unk> . It &apos;s called <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s all the <unk> resources .
One <unk> <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> at least who of us is in these <unk> areas of the planet , I realize that they &apos;re not <unk> at all .
For somebody is home .
<unk> <unk> of human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the time . And for all of these children , like the dreams of our kids , are part of the <unk> <unk> of hope .
And finally , we &apos;re <unk> <unk> that <unk> never to anything .
I think the <unk> --
<unk> <unk> , they don &apos;t <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our website <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public in places to <unk> our public in places of <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> for a <unk> world of <unk> : the <unk> world of <unk> diversity , and we need to find a <unk> <unk> world ,
where the <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I &apos;ve written in this book that I hope you &apos;ve heard about other <unk> , in case you don &apos;t know .
I &apos;d like to start with what I call the <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all <unk> societies . The <unk> <unk> <unk> : &quot; If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens , &quot; The way to do it is to <unk> freedom to <unk> . &quot;
The reason is , on one side , in the fact that freedom is itself a value , is <unk> , useful , <unk> for human beings .
<unk> else is the fact that if we are <unk> , every one of us can do anything that <unk> our <unk> , without any <unk> in our own name .
The way to <unk> freedom is <unk> choice .
The more <unk> people have , more <unk> , and more <unk> , is their <unk> , the greater <unk> , is their <unk> .
This , <unk> , is so <unk> <unk> in society that no one <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
And it &apos;s also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to give me a simple note on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge amount of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that nobody has no <unk> <unk> in your <unk> .
Here &apos;s what the <unk> is .
Then you go to the <unk> store for buy one <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
We can make six million and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are only one store .
<unk> <unk> there is <unk> choice .
<unk> fields : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the <unk> services , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , you don &apos;t <unk> it .
A <unk> of that , by the way , was that the phone never <unk> .
These days have gone .
Now we have a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , especially in cell phones .
Here &apos;s cell phones of the future .
My <unk> is in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
If you don &apos;t have seen it in the house , in the house , you &apos;re <unk> certain that soon is going to be <unk> .
And what happens to the end is that people <unk> and ask the question that question . And you know what about the answer is ? The answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
You can &apos;t buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t make things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : no longer in the United States that you <unk> from <unk> and <unk> you have to do .
Instead , <unk> by <unk> , and the <unk> says , &quot; OK , we could do A , or <unk> , &quot; A <unk> , &quot; <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You were like , &quot; <unk> , what do you do you do ? &quot;
And the <unk> says , &quot; A <unk> <unk> these <unk> and <unk> and <unk> these <unk> and <unk> these <unk> . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; <unk> if you were me , what would you say ? &quot;
And the <unk> , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; , &quot; I <unk> that makes it look like a great thing .
But in fact , it &apos;s not that a <unk> the weight and the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and so that doesn &apos;t know -- and it &apos;s certainly not in the <unk> -- and it &apos;s not in the <unk> <unk> <unk> to make decisions the patient .
There &apos;s a huge amount of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me and you , that if you think about it doesn &apos;t make any sense , because we can &apos;t <unk> it .
But if we can &apos;t <unk> it , why do we <unk> them ?
The answer is , they want to <unk> that we call the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
So , I &apos;m <unk> as well as we see in this <unk> , is a question of choice , as you see in this <unk> . &quot; We don &apos;t want to <unk> the kids . &quot; They don &apos;t want to <unk> a <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times we do .
That means that every <unk> , at <unk> , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
<unk> to the family and <unk> , a time perspective , the common perspective , almost for anyone , was that you would have <unk> as soon as possible .
The only real choice was to who , not when , and what to do after .
<unk> , all of it &apos;s really to play .
<unk> to students very smart , and they <unk> their 20 percent in less of work than a time .
And they &apos;re not because they &apos;re not <unk> , because they &apos;re not <unk> .
but because I &apos;m <unk> , I &apos;m <unk> to <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> or not ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> later ? &quot; I think before children or a career ? &quot;
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this <unk> doesn &apos;t <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and not get a good <unk> to my <unk> .
And they really have to do that . I &apos;m important questions .
Now , the work : we &apos;re <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because the technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from every corner of the planet , <unk> that from the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> , and I &apos;m not going to say anybody , where the <unk> works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What does that mean , this incredible <unk> of choice that we have to decide , <unk> in every moment , if we need to work or not .
We can go to see our son to play <unk> , with the <unk> , the <unk> in one <unk> , the other , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , on the <unk> .
And even though they &apos;re all <unk> , every minute that we see our son <unk> the <unk> , we &apos;re also <unk> , &quot; I have to answer this ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this <unk> ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , this makes the experience of your son very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , any of you look at , small and big objects , and big objects , life is a <unk> issue of choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there was some possibility , but not all of the <unk> was about choice .
The world &apos;s world today to this : The <unk> is , &quot; Is it a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? &quot;
The answer is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the <unk> .
<unk> this choice <unk> two of the people .
The first one , <unk> , is that <unk> instead of <unk> .
With a lot of <unk> between you and <unk> , it becomes very difficult .
I &apos;m going to give you an example of <unk> : a <unk> study of <unk> .
A <unk> has had access to the <unk> data , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in different <unk> <unk> .
What she found out is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> to <unk> , the <unk> of two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s 10 percent in less than when they &apos;re available only five . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> of <unk> , is it &apos;s hard to decide , and choice is <unk> to decide .
And in <unk> , and still <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and of course <unk> never comes to it .
<unk> that means that these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re not <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> up to five <unk> <unk> for the year of work , which would be well <unk> to <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> choice .
And I think it &apos;s going to change the world like this .
&quot; And finally , the <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
I could just make the right decision , if it &apos;s for <unk> , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the <unk> wrong , and <unk> the wrong <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can <unk> the <unk> and make a choice , in the end , we &apos;re less <unk> by the result of how we were <unk> with less <unk> .
And that for several reasons .
One of these is that with many <unk> of the <unk> of you , if you <unk> one and it &apos;s not perfect , you can imagine that they could make a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> choice , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> by the decision , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> by the decision , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> by the decision ,
even when it was a decision <unk> .
The more <unk> there are more <unk> than any <unk> that is <unk> of the choice .
<unk> , there &apos;s what <unk> call <unk> .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well <unk> how the value we <unk> things from what we <unk> .
And then , all of the rest of you can , it &apos;s easy to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that you have choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m <unk> with all of the ones I &apos;m not New York .
But that &apos;s what you probably know .
There &apos;s this <unk> <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It &apos;s all for them .
I don &apos;t know anything . But what he thinks , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; All of my <unk> are away . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> right in front of the house . &quot;
And it <unk> two weeks <unk> from the idea that &apos;s <unk> -- every day -- the chance of <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when we have , even when we have been choice .
And the more of the <unk> we have from <unk> , the more the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It &apos;s about living the moment , and it &apos;s maybe the way we live slowly .
But the most important thing is that you say , whatever you say , you &apos;re <unk> not to do .
The things that don &apos;t have a lot of <unk> that can make <unk> <unk> what we do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new <unk> .
They were almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were of one kind , <unk> them and <unk> them from <unk> , were <unk> , only after <unk> a <unk> life and <unk> a lot of <unk> , and I would go well .
So , I went to <unk> a couple of new when the <unk> were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> said to me , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
I want them to <unk> or with <unk> ? &quot; <unk> &quot; or &quot; <unk> &quot;
&quot; <unk> &quot; ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> wants to <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> -- &quot; <unk> to <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a while I was able to say , &quot; I want the kind of -- which was the only kind of , &quot; I &apos;m <unk> all the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then I &apos;m going to <unk> out of the <unk> , and then I was <unk> <unk> , with the best of <unk> <unk> I ever .
It was <unk> . With all that choice I had <unk> the best .
But I &apos;m <unk> worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that with all the choice , my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I was <unk> <unk> . I didn &apos;t tell you about when I just had one like , but when I was 100 different , <unk> , at least one kind of had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After I was <unk> to what I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in life of people don &apos;t do that <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
And this is <unk> <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of <unk> if it &apos;s <unk> .
Because if I <unk> it , I &apos;m not talking about what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is the truth of this .
&quot; You were better when you were worse , &quot; The reason he was doing better when he was worse was worse , and when he was worse , and he was worse than <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , the world that we live in -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> .
You never get <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> are <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you &apos;re here is , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; Yes , you want to do . &quot;
I mean -- small <unk> moment -- which I &apos;m really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn &apos;t have done a better , I didn &apos;t have <unk> .
But <unk> isn &apos;t always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> . When there &apos;s only that kind of <unk> is that when you &apos;re not <unk> , and you &apos;re going to tell you , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is <unk> ? &quot; The answer is <unk> .
The world is <unk> . What could I do ?
When there are hundreds of <unk> , and you get one <unk> , and you know , you know , you know , the <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> <unk> you .
I could have done better .
With hundreds of <unk> <unk> , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even if the result is <unk> , they <unk> and they give them the <unk> to them .
In the last few years , the <unk> is <unk> in the world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only one , but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is just that people have experiences because the <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation , they think that <unk> is .
So the final result is that in general we &apos;re better , <unk> , but we &apos;re worse .
Let me show you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely <unk> . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no <unk> that a little bit better than you don &apos;t understand at all , but from this doesn &apos;t <unk> that much choice is much better than a bit .
There &apos;s a <unk> value , <unk> . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve <unk> from a piece of the level that we have <unk> our lives .
Now , from a <unk> point of view -- I &apos;ve almost done -- from a <unk> point of view , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What allows all this choice in <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you have <unk> of it , where the problem isn &apos;t that they have <unk> .
The problem is they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I &apos;m talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> talked about yesterday about how those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> are <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> of money .
I mean these choices , <unk> and <unk> , not is that they &apos;re simply <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
They make us feel worse .
If some of what we do in our <unk> <unk> , that we could <unk> in those where people have too much chance , it &apos;s not only about their lives to <unk> , but our own .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of the income does well -- not only not only to the poor -- not only because of this choice in <unk> that we <unk> .
So to <unk> , &quot; <unk> , you can become anything you want to be --
<unk> , people of culture , <unk> , &quot; What do you know about that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s <unk> that you can &apos;t do anything in a glass . &quot;
&quot; A <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and I <unk> it like this , at first .
But then , I &apos;m <unk> , I realized that fish knows that fish knows a long knows a long <unk> .
Because the reality of the fact of the fact of the <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk> , so that &quot; everything is possible . &quot;
If you <unk> the <unk> so that you can <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
They all need a <unk> .
This is almost certainly <unk> too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
