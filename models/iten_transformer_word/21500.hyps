<unk> year I showed these <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years , had the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the United States , it &apos;s <unk> percent .
I <unk> this <unk> of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show you the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a sense , the heart of climate change .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> and it &apos;s <unk> .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You can see , it &apos;s <unk> up to the blue blue <unk> .
That &apos;s the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> , <unk> .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , five years , more , it &apos;s like the blood , that &apos;s where it &apos;s <unk> from the body .
In 25 years , in 25 years , so .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> is <unk> around the <unk> ocean , where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> , are <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , that amount of could <unk> , <unk> this <unk> point of not <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is already <unk> from the water .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> was <unk> with a <unk> team last <unk> last <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : She &apos;s fine . The question is if we <unk> it .
It &apos;s a reason that this <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the north .
This is a river in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> never <unk> like that .
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how to know it goes up the sea level to <unk> on <unk> , here is where the sea is <unk> .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
On the other side of the planet : <unk> , the biggest <unk> of ice on the planet .
<unk> month , scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of ice is in <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> feet of the level of <unk> , like in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the biggest third <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which few years ago , they were <unk> .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population <unk> <unk> water from that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : this <unk> is the source of the <unk> water <unk> of this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same happens to <unk> water .
In California <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is 40 percent .
<unk> <unk> are in crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they &apos;re <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the world takes to a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of normal and without <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years , than <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the whole <unk> .
If you look at it in the <unk> context , you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we &apos;ve <unk> million <unk> of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the ocean every day .
Look at <unk> the area of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and on both the parts of the <unk> <unk> , where there is a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean .
The greater cause of global warming , together to the <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And it &apos;s <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> <unk> .
But we &apos;re going to be <unk> to a <unk> of the direction .
These are the projects that are the <unk> projects in the last few years , and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there &apos;s a political <unk> in our country .
<unk> of <unk> and oil have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I <unk> image , I would <unk> something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Maybe you saw it on the <unk> .
This is the second largest flow of <unk> in America .
It &apos;s happened around <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> <unk> is a <unk> and happy .
It &apos;s <unk> here in America , and it &apos;s <unk> our economy .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , from here , I &apos;m a lot of <unk> <unk> .
The biggest <unk> society on the <unk> <unk> is <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> <unk> for the <unk> <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , one part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> , we see the <unk> changes like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , for this <unk> is <unk> a lot of money in a <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> the truth .
In fact , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it &apos;s <unk> -- it &apos;s got a good <unk> .
So we don &apos;t have to <unk> about climate change .
We could do it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> -- you &apos;ve heard about it .
So we &apos;re going to <unk> a <unk> structure for the <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> are a little <unk> , but this is the sound of <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> is between the major <unk> of global <unk> , but the <unk> technology of <unk> that you see changes everything .
And look at a look at this , this is the <unk> technology .
<unk> : <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic <unk> and the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : America is in the crisis ; the economy , national security , the national security crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all of the <unk> : our <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and oil <unk> .
Now , but there &apos;s a new one , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan to <unk> America to work , more <unk> more <unk> , and help <unk> <unk> global <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we can solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
<unk> : This is the last one .
<unk> : <unk> : This is about <unk> energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> , from the <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> a new <unk> network .
<unk> <unk> two : <unk> <unk> for jobs .
<unk> : <unk> America . It &apos;s time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A <unk> <unk> <unk> says , &quot; If you want to go to alone .
If you want to go away , you go back and go . &quot;
We need to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED I did a <unk> on the <unk> .
And I &apos;m trying to <unk> on how the machine works .
So here we go . And for those who was the other time , there were no <unk> , the <unk> is the biggest scientific <unk> ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were in the <unk> of a second -- until <unk> million times per second .
That &apos;s all <unk> .
This is the <unk> machine .
They <unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk> .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> feet , and it has a <unk> <unk> .
This is an <unk> image of <unk> <unk> so you can see the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , we &apos;ve <unk> the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s an image of the first <unk> of particles that had done all the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles into the <unk> .
In other words , when I <unk> that image the <unk> 10 <unk> , I would say that the machine <unk> , which is a great <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if this was that <unk> to make us <unk> more or this , when somebody <unk> on Google and they would <unk> that the <unk> page was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a <unk> impact on the scientific .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to just these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works when the car works at the <unk> .
Now , the <unk> of you <unk> <unk> and <unk> , &quot; It &apos;s not true . I &apos;m <unk> too <unk> . &quot;
And they can do it because when they &apos;re very <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees , at least <unk> degrees <unk> , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and that &apos;s <unk> about 30 <unk> .
It &apos;s about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we &apos;ve done .
We &apos;ve <unk> them and <unk> .
Now they &apos;re <unk> all the place they &apos;re going to get into their place .
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> is going to be new <unk> .
<unk> it , and we &apos;re going to get data to <unk> or <unk> , and continue like this <unk> to find out what the <unk> of the universe is .
Now , of course , in some way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering <unk> . It &apos;s easy to <unk> .
I think that &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s hard , the fact that I think is the value of things like <unk> .
I want to <unk> with the words of a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> , in <unk> of <unk> experiments of his <unk> , his <unk> was Michael <unk> , said , &quot; No is so <unk> for the human mind as the <unk> of the human mind as the <unk> that the ideas are <unk> , and that there are no <unk> to nature , and that we can &apos;t find new <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> <unk> to when , as children , <unk> with <unk> .
<unk> like <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , actually to think and solve problems and solve problems .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way most of the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with objects , together at my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started <unk> , I started thinking , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having the only <unk> of the <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> that moves on a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with both hands .
and we &apos;re going to <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that we wanted to try to explore the answer , building <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer <unk> like a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer <unk> like a <unk> .
And you can <unk> them with your hand , they can <unk> their own movement and they have a screen and they have a screen and they <unk> .
But <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> <unk> .
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> <unk> for <unk> information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement of the other , and as well as the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the movement , of the other , as we <unk> them , we can explore new <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
I &apos;ll start with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you about <unk> , if you put it in one direction , the <unk> video , so if we <unk> it on the other side .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , you know , you &apos;re <unk> to what &apos;s around them .
If they come up , they can <unk> it and they can <unk> it a little bit .
If they come up , they can <unk> it and they can <unk> it a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We then <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was the <unk> that we could use common <unk> on data , like <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk> and I can <unk> it to <unk> color of that central , where you <unk> .
and I can <unk> it to <unk> color color in that central . And where I was <unk> .
And we can <unk> it up , we can <unk> a little bit .
I &apos;m also <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> , <unk> and <unk> games where people can try things quickly , and <unk> the results immediately .
Now I &apos;m --
This is a <unk> sequence I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a game here that &apos;s <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> , <unk> a letter to <unk> , <unk> , at every <unk> , at every <unk> <unk> , and while I was <unk> <unk> words on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try to try .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the children <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> , I did so that I <unk> them and I <unk> them and I <unk> them up with a video .
They &apos;re very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things that is that you don &apos;t have to give people many <unk> .
I just wanted to say , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s over here , other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the right .
In fact , he wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
He wanted to build a <unk> <unk> <unk> . He &apos;s <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So , it &apos;s going to go out .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now he brought a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> .
You &apos;re working ! Yeah !
So , you <unk> <unk> and <unk> can make the characters --
<unk> : <unk> .
-- <unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> .
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with the <unk> open , and it can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with the <unk> open , and it can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I &apos;ve been doing is a <unk> , I recently made , to <unk> and <unk> music .
it &apos;s a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , to <unk> and <unk> music .
<unk> here we go from <unk> like <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of these has four different <unk> , and you can choose which to use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence sequence sequence of your <unk> .
And we just wanted to do a <unk> <unk> , &quot; sound &quot; and a sequence sequence . &quot;
These are actually that you can control live , like the <unk> and <unk> .
And it <unk> to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> it .
And then there &apos;s the <unk> effects of time and <unk> , <unk> <unk> to the whole sequence .
<unk> like this works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> in a series , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m going to take a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> . Now I &apos;m <unk>
<unk> : <unk> : And now I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> , so I can control the effect from alive .
<unk> : I can <unk> the entire sequence of time , I can <unk> the whole time , or on the other .
<unk> : <unk> : And now we <unk> the <unk> <unk> to give more <unk> .
<unk> : I can <unk> the <unk> &quot; at the <unk> . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> it , <unk> over long or more <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the whole time <unk> on the left the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
So as you can see , my passion is building new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as they work and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this path , and some possibilities we try to bring out of the <unk> .
The concept I want to <unk> is that it &apos;s <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> media , which <unk> in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time I &apos;m going to talk to you all .
I &apos;m a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and the <unk> of my life .
And it doesn &apos;t look like that .
But , I said this , something particular happened in my life and in my career , that led me to <unk> the whole relationship to <unk> the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I <unk> <unk> this book , this <unk> called &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; which , <unk> , I &apos;m going to talk about books , for some reason , and I <unk> a big <unk> , <unk> .
And the result is that I <unk> <unk> now , people would <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> to me now everybody <unk> and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t have fear that we can &apos;t be <unk> to do better ?
You &apos;re not afraid to continue writing for all life without being able to create a book that can <unk> somebody ? &quot;
What could it help to someone ? &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> , you know .
But it could be <unk> , <unk> I remember that over 20 years , when I was <unk> to say to people -- I was an <unk> -- that I wanted to be a <unk> .
I was <unk> to the same <unk> from fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t worry about this , could we have happened ?
You &apos;re not afraid that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> you ?
You &apos;re not afraid to do this <unk> for all life without any life that nothing has ever come out and die of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , you know .
The short answer to -- the short answer to all of these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yeah , I &apos;m afraid of all of that .
I &apos;ve always been afraid .
And I &apos;m also afraid of many other things that people couldn &apos;t <unk> .
Like <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as I was writing what I thought and I was <unk> <unk> , is it ?
Is it <unk> ?
It &apos;s <unk> that everybody <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel to do .
But what is this particular <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about health <unk> in a way that other <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> do they do they do ?
How do I think , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> , and I don &apos;t remember one time in his <unk> <unk> in his <unk> , where he was asked if he was afraid to be <unk> ?
It never <unk> us -- that <unk> <unk> John , like this ?
Don &apos;t do it ?
<unk> , the engineers <unk> like a group of not <unk> , in the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve got enough , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> but <unk> <unk> of any kind of , we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk> .
And another one of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often <unk> them .
And the ones that don &apos;t seem to be <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before I died , in the last <unk> said , &quot; Every my book has <unk> me a little bit more <unk> about this work of their life .
But we didn &apos;t know when we were <unk> to say , because we &apos;ve heard these things so long that we &apos;ve <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> that art and <unk> , at the end , at the end , <unk> , <unk> always <unk> <unk> .
And the question I want to tell you to all over here today is : <unk> with this idea ?
You &apos;re fine -- because it &apos;s <unk> from a <unk> <unk> to me not that &apos;s good for anything to do that <unk> .
I think it &apos;s <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s also <unk> and I don &apos;t want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better <unk> our great <unk> to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- I would be very <unk> to start <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> the <unk> that I &apos;m in my career .
<unk> -- look -- look , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;ve been <unk> , I &apos;m pretty young , and I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m pretty young , and I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;ve been <unk> , I &apos;m pretty young , and I &apos;ve been <unk> , I &apos;m pretty young , and so many years .
I &apos;ve got about four <unk> of work in me .
And it &apos;s very <unk> that whatever it is <unk> that whatever it is going to be <unk> by the world like the work that <unk> after my last book .
<unk> , because we &apos;re all <unk> friends , <unk> that my biggest <unk> is to my biggest <unk> is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> , thinking .
You know , this is the kind of thought that leads to person start <unk> at the nine <unk> in the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I could continue doing this work I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so , I think , after many <unk> , that the way to work to continue writing is to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I &apos;ve got to have a few ways to <unk> , which I &apos;m <unk> , and my natural <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> to you can get . And as I was going to go through the time , we &apos;re going to look through the <unk> , trying to find other societies to see if we had some of the best ideas . And the more <unk> ideas .
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research led me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s because they <unk> in <unk> and then they <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don &apos;t believe that creativity <unk> from men , OK ?
It <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men with some <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for reasons <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
The <unk> were the same idea , but they were <unk> that sort of <unk> <unk> with a <unk> .
which is <unk> , because the <unk> don &apos;t really feel that a <unk> was particularly <unk> .
I thought a <unk> was this <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> literally in the <unk> of the study of an artist like <unk> <unk> , and I was <unk> out to <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the work of it .
<unk> <unk> , here is the distance I talk about -- that <unk> <unk> you from the results that I &apos;m going to <unk> you from the results of your work .
And everyone <unk> that was so <unk> , right ?
So , the <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like the too <unk> , right ?
If your work was <unk> , you &apos;re not <unk> to <unk> all the <unk> , you would all be <unk> that you would have been <unk> by this <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it was not all <unk> , right ?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity <unk> a long time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and everything , and we <unk> this great idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe on the <unk> and <unk> and no longer to <unk> space that <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
This was the <unk> principle and people started to think that creativity was completely <unk> by the <unk> .
And for the first time in history , it &apos;s <unk> to <unk> this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I think I &apos;ve got a big <unk> .
I think that &apos;s going to someone , a simple person to believe that it &apos;s like a source , <unk> and <unk> of all <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a responsibility to <unk> too much of giving the human <unk> .
It &apos;s like to someone who &apos;s <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> and creates all of these <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> all of these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in the 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it &apos;s true , the question becomes , and now ?
We can do it <unk> ?
They want to come back to a more <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t <unk> 500 years of thinking about this , 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , do you <unk> people <unk> to <unk> on their projects .
You probably don &apos;t <unk> you all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to <unk> is -- why not ?
Why don &apos;t we <unk> this way ?
Because more sense of everything that I &apos;ve ever heard about to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
A process that , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so basically , everybody here -- knows , you know , you don &apos;t know <unk> .
And , in fact , it can sometimes look completely <unk> .
I did this meeting I was <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , who has now 90 years , but that was a <unk> <unk> for the whole life and said that during his <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the fields , and I <unk> it , inside the fields , and I <unk> it , in the fields , and I <unk> it , in the fields , and I would <unk> it , in the fields , and he was a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
He said , he was like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> <unk> towards her <unk> .
<unk> it to come up , because it was <unk> the land under his feet .
I decided to have one thing to do , and it was , words , &quot; <unk> like a <unk> . &quot;
And so he went back home and he came from this <unk> , and he wouldn &apos;t have to do something else that take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> on the page .
<unk> times , I couldn &apos;t be enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> it through and she would <unk> them and she would <unk> them and she would <unk> up through the <unk> , looking , like she said , &quot; another <unk> . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this piece was never -- there were times -- there were times when the <unk> was almost <unk> , OK ?
So , he was <unk> at home and he was looking at paper and <unk> <unk> through , and he <unk> a <unk> <unk> right in the while he was <unk> , and then he said , that was like , if he <unk> with the other hand and the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and <unk> in his body and <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the page <unk> and <unk> , but <unk> <unk> , from the last word to the first word .
So when I <unk> <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not all my whole process of <unk> -- I &apos;m not a <unk> .
I &apos;m a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; I <unk> <unk> every day and <unk> and work and <unk> and <unk> and work and <unk> and <unk> and work and <unk> over <unk> .
But even I , in my <unk> , I &apos;ve <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I would say that many of you the <unk> .
You know , even though the work and ideas I would <unk> myself to be a certain source I could not <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it in a way that we don &apos;t do that , but rather , that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> us to do it ?
And I &apos;m going to do is , the best example of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;ve <unk> several years ago for a <unk> .
I was talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the artist <unk> <unk> , trying to control , <unk> , <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , he <unk> , and one day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> everything for him .
<unk> , I &apos;m going fast and everything about a little <unk> of <unk> , who comes in his head like <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , you know , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and <unk> , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and <unk> , but it doesn &apos;t know how to <unk> .
It has no piece of paper , it has not a <unk> , it has no <unk> .
So he starts to feel this kind of old <unk> <unk> , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose it on , and I &apos;m going to <unk> it from this <unk> song .
I &apos;m not <unk> enough , and I can &apos;t <unk> it . &quot;
And instead of going to <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> .
It <unk> the whole process and it made something completely new .
I just wanted the sky and said , &quot; <unk> , do you see I &apos;m <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Do you think it can write a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , I &apos;ll get a more <unk> when I can <unk> care about you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> another one .
<unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And his process was going to go back after this .
It &apos;s not work , it was the work , it was <unk> as always <unk> .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he was <unk> when he was <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> out of him , and I would <unk> it back from where it was , I thought that was <unk> , and I would <unk> it back from , and I would <unk> that would be <unk> and <unk> .
but <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this thing <unk> and <unk> <unk> , but it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
So how much <unk> that story I &apos;m going to change a little bit , even the way I <unk> and I &apos;ve already <unk> .
And this idea , I was <unk> when I was <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; and I <unk> , &quot; and I <unk> in one of those <unk> in which we &apos;re all working on something and we can &apos;t be a <unk> , and we can &apos;t think it will ever be a book , which is going to be the <unk> book .
Not just <unk> , just the book written .
And we started thinking about this project .
But then I decided to <unk> that I <unk> to the air and <unk> .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and I <unk> my face to a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I said <unk> , &quot; <unk> , what , we know that if this book is not going to be <unk> <unk> , my <unk> ?
Because as I see I &apos;m <unk> all over that I have , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to <unk> and do your <unk> .
Okay . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , I don &apos;t do it .
I started writing the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to please that it was <unk> that I &apos;ve been <unk> to do my own <unk> . &quot; Because -- I <unk> it is so , OK -- I &apos;ll do in the <unk> of Africa , the people <unk> to be <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and hours to <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every while , I <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> .
And I know what I do , because I know you &apos;ve all got , because I know you &apos;ve all got to do , you know , at some point , a <unk> like this .
It was like time , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it wasn &apos;t doing anything different from the time , like the <unk> <unk> <unk> first , but it was all <unk> .
And suddenly it doesn &apos;t <unk> <unk> as a human just .
But it <unk> from <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , they <unk> him up with his name .
<unk> hands and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; to &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; that you can still feel in <unk> or in <unk> .
In <unk> , when a artist has done something impossible and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> -- a God <unk> .
And it &apos;s <unk> because we need it .
But the problem comes the next day , for the <unk> , when you <unk> and <unk> that are <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> that are <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of God , there &apos;s no more .
It &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> with a lot of <unk> <unk> , and maybe we never <unk> to <unk> that <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God , while I was <unk> , and what has to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to make in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so <unk> if you can &apos;t believe , <unk> , <unk> that the most <unk> <unk> of your being come from yourself .
But just <unk> you data from a <unk> of this <unk> part of this <unk> part of your life you have to go to another <unk> when you &apos;re finished .
And , you know , if we think this way all changes .
And so I started <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> like I <unk> it for several months in the book that I was <unk> early <unk> , I was <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> of my success .
And what I have to continue <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , I don &apos;t fear .
You don &apos;t <unk> . It &apos;s just your work .
<unk> to <unk> for your <unk> , any of any <unk> you can be .
If your work is <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> .
If you <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> <unk> to you <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for one moment through your <unk> , then you know , then you &apos;re going to <unk> . &quot;
<unk> , you do the same <unk> .
And &quot; <unk> ! &quot; to yourself .
I think and I think it &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; to yourself , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know I &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects about the human genome , on what it can <unk> and discovery of new genes of genes .
We &apos;re going to <unk> a new path , we &apos;ve started to <unk> biology and now starting from that digital code , we &apos;re <unk> in a new <unk> <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> life .
We &apos;ve always tried to <unk> big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; is something that many <unk> I think they &apos;ve been <unk> to understand different levels .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> <unk> to the <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> from almost 20 years now .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go from the <unk> world of biology to the digital world of computers .
Now , what can we <unk> life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> species of the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> a little bit more .
We &apos;re able to <unk> a <unk> <unk> of about 500 I &apos;m here .
But when we look at his <unk> map , it &apos;s <unk> simple than our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at a time , it &apos;s very <unk> that this can lead to a <unk> cell .
So I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> some of these <unk> questions .
And so we started the <unk> of &quot; <unk> we can <unk> a <unk> ? &quot;
Can the chemical <unk> of produce these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And in case , can we make a <unk> <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The speed with which we &apos;re able to <unk> life is starting to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the <unk> code , instead , <unk> rather slowly , but it &apos;s <unk> .
And our most <unk> results that lead to a <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve been <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> many <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> before the first experiments .
But we &apos;ve found that we <unk> DNA <unk> is very difficult .
There &apos;s <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> little <unk> of DNA , of <unk> 30 to 50 <unk> and it &apos;s a <unk> process : the more <unk> is along , the more <unk> is there .
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , <unk> <unk> of information <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a little <unk> that <unk> bacteria .
We designed <unk> , <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part of it is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> it in bacteria , the bacteria <unk> <unk> this , and they <unk> the <unk> particles .
<unk> particles have been then <unk> by cells , they <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ve talked about recently members of the <unk> industry that they &apos;ve been <unk> this model .
They &apos;ve got more than you .
I thought this is a situation where the software can really build its own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we wanted to do the biggest things .
They wanted to build the entire <unk> of the <unk> .
It &apos;s more than <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we thought we could <unk> in <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , so we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> are the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> information to a computer , these have to be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> , the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve discovered , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If we could use that original sequence never could do it .
One of the process is designing <unk> <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> <unk> to build smaller <unk> that <unk> together .
<unk> elements here .
You probably have read that we &apos;re <unk> to <unk> .
So we have a <unk> code that <unk> <unk> on four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , and there &apos;s a <unk> order of <unk> <unk> for every <unk> .
So we can use the <unk> code for words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did we do at the beginning was <unk> .
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> with <unk> .
There &apos;s <unk> that we <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to them to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> we &apos;ve made these <unk> <unk> in <unk> so that we &apos;re trying to create an extremely <unk> <unk> <unk> as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to <unk> the process .
So , this looks like the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When I started these <unk> <unk> , more than 100 <unk> <unk> <unk> , no longer <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we &apos;ve <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> <unk> to <unk> DNA .
Here &apos;s an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , it can <unk> three million <unk> <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> like his <unk> <unk> .
In 12 hours , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , it was <unk> .
<unk> thousands of organisms that can be able to do that .
These organisms can be completely <unk> .
You &apos;ve got to live under <unk> .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and they &apos;re <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
In fact , NASA has shown that this happens .
This is an image of the <unk> that we &apos;ve built using these <unk> , just using the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> them .
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s such a big <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a time of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we &apos;ve done a little time ago .
It &apos;s more than <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s the biggest <unk> of a <unk> structure ever <unk> by man .
It has a <unk> weight <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 <unk> , we &apos;ll just <unk> pages to <unk> this code .
Now , how can we do it work ? How can we <unk> it ?
Of course , through a virus is a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a little bit more <unk> when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s more simple when it &apos;s <unk> cells like our : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the <unk> process .
In the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> is instead of <unk> in the cell , but we &apos;ve <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re able to do a <unk> <unk> of a cell <unk> from a cell to another and <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> species .
The two different are how men are from <unk> .
We &apos;ve <unk> some <unk> <unk> more so we can decide what this <unk> to choose to be .
He then <unk> it up with the <unk> so that it <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> into the cell .
And <unk> <unk> that we didn &apos;t want to go beyond , but we tried to <unk> it out there .
This is one of the biggest <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere , you know , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So who thinks evolution as a <unk> <unk> at a time that <unk> has not <unk> <unk> of biology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> DNA .
The <unk> that was in the cell that was in the cell .
The <unk> <unk> we &apos;ve <unk> it .
It &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> , <unk> , and we <unk> it , and we <unk> with only the cell that &apos;s <unk> .
it has become blue because of genes that we &apos;ve <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species went to the <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> of all in a new species , <unk> on the new software that we &apos;ve <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code will <unk> exactly what we &apos;ve <unk> .
Now , this may be <unk> <unk> , but we can <unk> the software DNA , we can change things in <unk> enough .
Now , I &apos;ve already <unk> that we &apos;re not talking about <unk> -- but I &apos;ve been <unk> from three million years and a half million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> in which we can <unk> new species <unk> on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion , and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give you an example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there &apos;s now three people on the planet to <unk> it in <unk> ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re going to <unk> now to find food , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for six billion people .
It &apos;s even more <unk> to do it for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , over 30 billion <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> .
That means 100 million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process to <unk> , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
And we need to <unk> that all the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
At the same time , because of the <unk> <unk> in the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that &apos;s <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry <unk> only one <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from reality and our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , thank you very much of the <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think of these 20 million genes or <unk> or <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , with a small team , and create more biology <unk> that in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard <unk> <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> , <unk> or chemistry or chemistry or chemical production , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is an <unk> of some software <unk> that we &apos;re working on to be able to <unk> and design species to do it .
Well , we don &apos;t know how to be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
We &apos;re <unk> now <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
You saw this one of the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We &apos;ve <unk> and third generation that we &apos;ve <unk> enough to <unk> from <unk> to <unk> more <unk> than the <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a huge impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> , it would be <unk> CO2 in matter before , so that we &apos;re working on design for the <unk> , and we think we can get this first generation of them to design this , and we think we can have the first <unk> of <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> solar <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> in the world , we &apos;ve found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we &apos;ve <unk> in <unk> .
It &apos;s going to be in the deep ocean , about <unk> feet deep to the temperature of water .
It &apos;s <unk> by using hydrogen <unk> as hydrogen .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2 , which can easily be <unk> through <unk> , <unk> that CO2 <unk> into <unk> , to drive this process .
So we <unk> think we might be able to <unk> what we might be able to <unk> what the basic question of what is , we <unk> <unk> the whole <unk> of <unk> the whole <unk> of <unk> the whole <unk> .
<unk> . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you ?
It &apos;s a <unk> of energy .
And we &apos;re working on using the same <unk> to use the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk> .
You saw this year with flu <unk> , we always went back and with a dollar less <unk> when it comes to find the right <unk> .
I think that you can change building <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
Here &apos;s how the future could start to look <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> the evolution of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and finally cells .
We &apos;re so <unk> to <unk> people .
Our purpose is to do so much a long enough to try to <unk> it . Thank you very much .
First of all , I &apos;m going to show you , the <unk> <unk> , some fundamental work , of the new technology that we took to the <unk> <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk> almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
It &apos;s a environment where you can <unk> is at local level that you can <unk> with a huge amount of data <unk> .
Here we &apos;re seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a <unk> <unk> , <unk> the images like .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much of information we see , how much of the <unk> of data or the images .
Most of the most of the photographs , but this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It &apos;s not a difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in any time . It &apos;s also very <unk> architecture .
This is a book , the whole example of data not images .
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
So , in order to <unk> that it &apos;s not about images , we can do something like this , to make a really <unk> of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little <unk> to read a little <unk> book .
You can &apos;t tell you .
This is an <unk> example . This is a <unk> number of The <unk> .
Every image of a big picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of how to read the real version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature of a <unk> .
We &apos;ve also done something with the <unk> of this particular number of The <unk> .
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much higher than what you use in a normal <unk> , and we &apos;ve <unk> you in the <unk> of the <unk> .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see it here .
Or even the <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
I thought this would be <unk> to <unk> and other <unk> , and other <unk> <unk> , not to be <unk> .
Of course , <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this not to lose time , if not to say that we have <unk> <unk> to give in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. <unk> over the <unk> picture .
So now I &apos;m going to try something else .
This is actually live on the Web ; you can see it .
It &apos;s a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a very interesting <unk> <unk> <unk> , a very interesting <unk> student of <unk> , a <unk> student of Washington , with the help of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s live on the Web , <unk> by <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from an image to the other and have this kind of experience <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here actually has a meaning .
So the <unk> <unk> of the computer <unk> have these images together , so that <unk> <unk> <unk> where the <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk> . So here &apos;s the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> , and these things have been all <unk> <unk> , and these things have been all <unk> <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There &apos;s some more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> data , and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that we &apos;ve done for the first time , the summer <unk> to show you what <unk> is really the key to show you what <unk> is really the key <unk> of this technology , <unk> technology . And it &apos;s not <unk> so <unk> , looking at the <unk> that we &apos;re going to do the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> and so forth .
This is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> . <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> an image that has been discovered to this model .
So they &apos;re all <unk> <unk> and they &apos;ve been all <unk> <unk> <unk> in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to <unk> this way .
You know , you know , I would never thought I would ever end up .
It &apos;s very <unk> <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think we &apos;re going to see that this is a lot of different kinds of <unk> : that &apos;s cell phone <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> number , <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I can , I get out to look at those <unk> .
A lot of people are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
<unk> here is a series of photos -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from <unk> to the physical view of this environment .
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now <unk> data from the whole memory of how to <unk> the Earth , from the whole <unk> of how to <unk> the Earth , from the whole data .
All those pictures become <unk> together , greater than the <unk> of the parts .
You have a model of the Earth <unk> .
Think about this as the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> on Earth .
It &apos;s something that <unk> in complexity that people <unk> it , and the <unk> for who <unk> him with the use .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people .
If somebody comes the idea of <unk> , all of these <unk> <unk> the name , my picture of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , they <unk> all those data , and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> to <unk> space , in that <unk> , using the pictures of everyone else , and have a social <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all of this is extremely <unk> <unk> of every part of the land , <unk> not only from <unk> and <unk> images and <unk> .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understood ? What &apos;s good for the software to do is that at some point in the next few years , all the photographs that have been <unk> <unk> by anybody in the world , we &apos;re going to be <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is we &apos;re going to find out .
It &apos;s creating <unk> , if you want , in the images .
And it &apos;s doing it on the content of the content .
And the thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> information that many of these <unk> images .
As you get a research on images on the Web , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the Web page has a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture is <unk> all your photos ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> <unk> that &apos;s really huge . It &apos;s a <unk> effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it &apos;s really amazing . <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> you very much .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is the <unk> that we can live between who doesn &apos;t <unk> the <unk> <unk> , between the wind <unk> , the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of plants .
<unk> to think that <unk> <unk> still beyond <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> , <unk> still <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and that the idea that we live in not in <unk> sense , but it &apos;s just a model of reality .
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> <unk> that our <unk> has done , good or bad , many <unk> <unk> does .
And , of course , everybody <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . Everybody <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
We need to deal with the <unk> of death , so we couldn &apos;t <unk> it , if it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> --
We all have an art .
What <unk> is the <unk> <unk> of the song , the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of <unk> .
He was my <unk> of the journey in the <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> , the mother <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> <unk> of the world .
All of these <unk> are <unk> , there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And , if you <unk> a second , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of the world create a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and it &apos;s important for the <unk> as a <unk> <unk> known as <unk> <unk> .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> , and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> , <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being by human imagination .
<unk> is the fantastic <unk> of humanity .
It &apos;s the <unk> of what we &apos;re and what we can be as <unk> species .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> much faster .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , because it &apos;s <unk> , or -- in the <unk> of the <unk> diversity -- and and and you don &apos;t even understand a little <unk> <unk> -- that <unk> diversity .
The <unk> of this is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
It &apos;s not just a language <unk> or a <unk> or a series of rules .
One language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle with the <unk> that we have <unk> of every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a <unk> , a thought , a <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we &apos;re sitting in <unk> , at least half is not <unk> in the <unk> of children .
They &apos;re not <unk> to children , which means that they &apos;re not <unk> to do something , which is not <unk> .
What is more <unk> than the <unk> of being <unk> by the <unk> , of being the last few language , of the <unk> of being <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of children ?
This <unk> <unk> is the state of someone in some of the world every two weeks : every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> with it <unk> the <unk> of a language <unk> .
And I know that some of you <unk> , &quot; <unk> &apos;t it ?
The world would not be a better place if we <unk> all the same language ? &quot; <unk> , we all talk . &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> a <unk> thing that means that we can talk about their language .
I &apos;d like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we &apos;re going to <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say , &quot; different ways of <unk> , &quot; I mean different ways of <unk> .
So for example , <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , which <unk> to the <unk> <unk> from the river of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> that can &apos;t <unk> the color from the green because the time <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , which <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , you have to <unk> a person talking about a <unk> .
All of this has <unk> in the <unk> past , <unk> is that in these <unk> where you &apos;re talking about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> nobody <unk> .
He was <unk> to listen and then he started talking .
I had one of the most interesting <unk> that I lived with , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> contact . It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;ve done <unk> from the <unk> photographs that <unk> them in <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> <unk> forest had never seen anything .
They <unk> the <unk> <unk> , they <unk> their <unk> <unk> , they <unk> their <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> that they <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with the <unk> .
But <unk> don &apos;t just <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> with them .
<unk> percent <unk> <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We went back to eight <unk> and we found two cases of natural <unk> and we &apos;ve been <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was so <unk> that he died <unk> , and then they <unk> it . And then they <unk> the same . <unk> <unk> , and then they <unk> it .
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and to <unk> the species .
<unk> <unk> , I was <unk> , I was <unk> a really interesting <unk> when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me , if I wanted to go to <unk> between the <unk> <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> to use .
To make sense of <unk> , I should have <unk> the <unk> culture , and the <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s pretty <unk> <unk> view of the world .
<unk> .
If you &apos;re going to <unk> the great <unk> of the world , what would you <unk> me ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that <unk> Africa <unk> doesn &apos;t have <unk> <unk> . And instead , the <unk> is nothing else that <unk> <unk> very <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes it interesting is that <unk> is the <unk> of life and death .
So <unk> do <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> , so that for a short <unk> becomes the <unk> .
That &apos;s why <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , you go to <unk> to <unk> God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . &quot;
And since you &apos;re <unk> , is the spirit that you &apos;re <unk> , how can you <unk> ?
So it &apos;s <unk> to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the power of mind on the body when it &apos;s <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> that I lived with the most <unk> <unk> are the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that once <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> has never been <unk> by <unk> .
And in <unk> , I &apos;m <unk> from a <unk> , but their training is extraordinary <unk> .
<unk> are <unk> <unk> from <unk> to <unk> families to three or four years , and they live in a world that was <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the bottom of the <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> years I &apos;ve been <unk> about <unk> the nine months of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of the mother <unk> , now I &apos;m <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
For this time , they &apos;re <unk> to the values of their society , <unk> that <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to <unk> the <unk> <unk> -- or to say <unk> <unk> .
And in this incredible <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> <unk> out and for the first time in their life , at 18 years , they see an <unk> . And in that moment of the first <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk> , everything that they learned in <unk> has <unk> <unk> , everything that they learned in <unk> has learned in <unk> all over the <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ? <unk> , I said . &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> . Now it &apos;s <unk> to you . &quot;
They call the <unk> <unk> <unk> and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re the <unk> of the world .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think about the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the old history of <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> in his <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are closer to Earth .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by <unk> .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , but because of time and <unk> , have created a <unk> of the Earth is <unk> that we &apos;re going to be close to this concept , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> : the concept that Earth can only because it &apos;s <unk> by human <unk> .
What does it mean ?
I mean that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> its <unk> is going to be a human <unk> and will have a very well relationship and it will have a very <unk> <unk> with the mountain or that <unk> that <unk> <unk> that <unk> a mountain is <unk> that would be <unk> .
<unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is that <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> to be <unk> .
That made me a human being different from my friends , <unk> who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> .
If we started <unk> that these <unk> can create different , we started to understand some of them <unk> <unk> . They <unk> this <unk> .
I <unk> this picture at <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you &apos;ve heard about <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What makes it fascinating is not the <unk> potential of the <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> from two elements .
On the one hand , this <unk> <unk> that has a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> has a <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit , but it &apos;s <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> of the family <unk> said <unk> .
This <unk> has <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you ever see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> that make a different <unk> of species , <unk> it has <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . <unk> &apos;t creates a <unk> of the <unk> .
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> my <unk> can &apos;t be <unk> these <unk> as a <unk> , because if you can &apos;t tell anybody to be <unk> . <unk> <unk> , but they can &apos;t be <unk> because they &apos;re <unk> by a <unk> that is <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
You can <unk> <unk> only if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
Now this is the <unk> that are <unk> that are <unk> in this <unk> <unk> of <unk> , the same kind of necessary <unk> . The <unk> question : in a <unk> of plants , like these <unk> <unk> two <unk> don &apos;t like that , but if you <unk> this way , they create a <unk> <unk> <unk> that is <unk> <unk> .
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you <unk> to the <unk> , we would call &quot; <unk> plants . &quot;
What does it mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that our eyes <unk> in the forest , and our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If I <unk> it as a <unk> <unk> , they would <unk> us , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> of plants , you don &apos;t know everything ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take the <unk> <unk> in a <unk> of the moon and <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
And so , with that , you can &apos;t get <unk> , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , <unk> the problem is that even those of us who have <unk> <unk> <unk> them , but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of history of the <unk> of history of the <unk> of history of our real world , and it <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk> , but rather like the was where we <unk> and <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the planet is not the change .
All the <unk> were <unk> in a new <unk> for new <unk> <unk> .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> like this <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> like <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It &apos;s the power .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
And if you look at a look at the world , you know that these are not <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> and <unk> <unk> out of <unk> <unk> that are <unk> <unk> that go beyond their <unk> <unk> .
<unk> you &apos;re <unk> to <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> who lived in the forest until a generation ago , and now <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , where you can see the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> .
If we <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I &apos;m doing many research , you &apos;ll see the <unk> <unk> of political <unk> .
As <unk> <unk> , the <unk> physics of a <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> to <unk> level , but the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of a <unk> , not only is <unk> , but <unk> <unk> <unk> in some <unk> , because it &apos;s part of the development of the <unk> of the development .
And you can &apos;t understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you go from the beginning .
I <unk> miles from <unk> in the <unk> China through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> <unk> , I just got to understand what &apos;s behind the <unk> that I &apos;m going to talk about .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> at the <unk> <unk> .
That means that it has been <unk> to the <unk> of Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that led the <unk> <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and her <unk> <unk> was <unk> .
It was taken of <unk> <unk> at age two <unk> under his <unk> because he couldn &apos;t live without <unk> .
The <unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
One day he <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and for this <unk> , it was <unk> to work for seven years .
The pain of the <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> is by <unk> .
<unk> , all of the <unk> <unk> to a choice .
Do you want to live in the <unk> world or we want to <unk> the world <unk> of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died said that his biggest <unk> was that , in our <unk> view of the world , not only <unk> the entire <unk> of the world , not only <unk> the entire human imagination , to a <unk> <unk> of thought , but one day we <unk> us from a <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it &apos;s <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , who has given us <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , creating the <unk> of the <unk> , creating the <unk> of the <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
<unk> world <unk> has to <unk> 300 years .
That <unk> history , I didn &apos;t tell you that we have the answers to all the challenges that we could <unk> in the <unk> to come .
When I <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human , we &apos;re <unk> with <unk> <unk> different .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all <unk> the <unk> of being what we &apos;re -- a <unk> species , which has to be <unk> , and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there &apos;s big moments of <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the north of the <unk> island , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> me , and this man , <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The <unk> government has not been <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> to <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man is <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> for his <unk> , <unk> , <unk> all the <unk> , and all of his <unk> .
We wanted to know that <unk> don &apos;t <unk> the cold , they <unk> it .
The <unk> <unk> were made of fish <unk> fish .
The <unk> of this man didn &apos;t <unk> from night or <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> away , it &apos;s <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> in their hand . When I did <unk> them , they <unk> them up , they <unk> them by <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog <unk> .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> has created a <unk> , <unk> another dog and <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> of <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> you &apos;re going to talk to <unk> ? <unk> . And this , in different ways , <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> the government <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of an area bigger <unk> of <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s their new <unk> . It &apos;s called <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> all the <unk> resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , to finish , I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> at least , at least , at least , to the <unk> areas of the planet , <unk> that &apos;s not <unk> at all .
It &apos;s house .
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the time . And for us all , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our children , they become part of the <unk> <unk> of hope .
<unk> , we &apos;re <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to anything .
I would say , &quot; <unk> &quot;
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we &apos;re the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our website <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public <unk> to bring our public places of <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from how much they saw , and they <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> time for the <unk> of <unk> : the <unk> of <unk> , and we need to find a <unk> world in a <unk> world and <unk>
where the <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I &apos;ve written in this book that I hope you &apos;ve heard and <unk> some <unk> , in case you &apos;re not going to .
I want to start with what I call the &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
<unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all society <unk> <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> : &quot; If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens , &quot; The way to do it is to <unk> the freedom <unk> . &quot;
The reason is , from one side , in the fact that freedom is <unk> itself , <unk> , <unk> for humans .
On the other is that if we &apos;re <unk> , every one of us can do this for us to do everything that <unk> our <unk> , without any one <unk> in our name .
The way to <unk> the freedom is <unk> choice .
More choices , the more <unk> , the more <unk> , and more of them is their <unk> .
This , <unk> , is so <unk> <unk> in society that nobody has <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it &apos;s also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I had a simple note about <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there &apos;s <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> and 12 <unk> that you can buy to make a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> that nobody is <unk> that you can buy a huge number of <unk> in your <unk> .
Here &apos;s what the <unk> is .
And then you go to the <unk> store to buy a <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> , radio , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> <unk> .
We can do six and a half million different <unk> <unk> that there &apos;s in one <unk> .
<unk> <unk> that there is a <unk> choice .
<unk> <unk> : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a kid , you could get all the <unk> services , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , it doesn &apos;t <unk> it .
A <unk> of that , the one of the other , was that the phone never <unk> .
These days they went .
We have now a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , especially in <unk> , especially cell phones .
Here &apos;s cell phones of the future .
My <unk> is the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
If you haven &apos;t seen it in the house , you &apos;re very <unk> that you &apos;re very early in the house , you &apos;re very <unk> .
And what happens is that people <unk> in the <unk> and they ask this question . And you know what the answer is ? The answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do <unk> things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : You don &apos;t happen in the United States you <unk> from the <unk> and the <unk> you have to do .
Instead , <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> says , &quot; OK , we can do A , or <unk> , &quot; A <unk> , or <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You were <unk> , &quot; <unk> , what would you do ? &quot;
And the <unk> says , &quot; A <unk> <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> and <unk> <unk> these <unk> . &quot;
&quot; What do you do you do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; <unk> if she was me , what would you say ? &quot;
And the <unk> , &quot; But I &apos;m not she . &quot;
And the result we call it &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But in fact , it &apos;s not that a <unk> of weight and <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> decisions by somebody who knows something , <unk> the <unk> , to <unk> that doesn &apos;t know -- and that &apos;s <unk> -- and we don &apos;t know -- and we don &apos;t know -- and then in the <unk> to make decisions , which is the patient .
There &apos;s a huge <unk> of products , <unk> to people like me and you , that if you think about it , you know , because we can &apos;t think about it .
But if we can &apos;t <unk> , why would we <unk> them ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of this <unk> as it is our <unk> now is a question of choice , as you see in this <unk> , &quot; We don &apos;t want to <unk> kids . We want to be <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
That means that every <unk> , <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
<unk> to the family and <unk> , a time perspective , <unk> , almost to anyone , was that we had to <unk> the <unk> early <unk> , and they <unk> to <unk> kids , the <unk> <unk> .
The only one of the one who , not when , and not , what you do after that .
<unk> , everything is really to play .
<unk> students to very smart students , and they <unk> them 20 percent less work than a time .
And because they &apos;re not <unk> , because they &apos;re not <unk> <unk> .
but why they &apos;re <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> or not ? <unk> <unk> or not ? <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Do you want to think before ? I got to think before or career ? &quot;
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
And they &apos;re trying to answer these questions , even though this <unk> doesn &apos;t <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and do not get a good <unk> at my <unk> .
And they really have to do that . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the job : we &apos;re <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because technology will allow us to work every minute , from every corner of the planet , <unk> that from the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> , and I won &apos;t tell anybody that where the <unk> works .
I don &apos;t tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this incredible means is freedom of choice we have to do this . Is it that we have to decide , <unk> at every time , if we need to work or not .
We can go to see our son , <unk> , with the cell phone in a <unk> , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , on the <unk> .
And even though they &apos;re all <unk> , every minute that we see our son <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re also <unk> , we &apos;re going to answer this call ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve got to answer this <unk> ? I &apos;ve got to <unk> this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , this makes the experience of your <unk> son of your <unk> son , very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , from any of any <unk> , we look at little , and great objects , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but not all was a question of choice .
The world &apos;s world today to this : <unk> is , &quot; Is it a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? &quot;
The answer is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the <unk> .
I &apos;m going to <unk> this choice two <unk> people .
The first one , <unk> , is it <unk> instead of <unk> .
With a lot of <unk> between you and you get a lot of hard to do .
I &apos;ll give you an example of <unk> : a <unk> study <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> has had access to data <unk> , <unk> <unk> society , <unk> <unk> , with about a million <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
What she found was that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> <unk> in more , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> of two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s 10 percent in less than when they &apos;re available five . Because ?
Because with 50 <unk> between you <unk> , and it &apos;s hard to decide , and the choice is <unk> to the <unk> .
And in <unk> , and still <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course <unk> is never coming .
<unk> that doesn &apos;t mean just these <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> , because they don &apos;t have enough money , it &apos;s also to say that the decision is so <unk> that <unk> the <unk> <unk> of work .
They &apos;re not <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> up to five <unk> <unk> per year from the <unk> of work , that would be <unk> <unk> .
So <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices .
And I think it &apos;s going to <unk> the world .
&quot; And to end the <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
I could just make the right decision , if it &apos;s for the <unk> , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and you <unk> the wrong <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even though we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice , at the end of how we were <unk> with less <unk> between the <unk> .
And that for several reasons .
One of these is that with many <unk> between you <unk> , if you <unk> one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that is that <unk> <unk> <unk> will <unk> us to <unk> the decision , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by the decision , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> by the decision , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
even when it was a <unk> <unk> decision .
<unk> choices there are , the more <unk> than any <unk> that is <unk> <unk> of the choice .
<unk> , there &apos;s what <unk> call <unk> .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well <unk> as the value that we give things from what we do with .
And yet , when there &apos;s lots of <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and be less <unk> of the <unk> that you have to be <unk> .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;ll <unk> with all those who are not in New York .
But that &apos;s what you &apos;re probably going to work .
There &apos;s this <unk> to the <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not going to do anything . But what he thinks is , &quot; Well , <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; All my <unk> <unk> are away . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> right in front of home . &quot;
And it &apos;s going to <unk> two weeks from the idea that &apos;s <unk> -- every day -- the ability to <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for what we &apos;ve , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the more of the <unk> we have <unk> , the more the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> us <unk> .
Here &apos;s another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It &apos;s about living the moment , and maybe it &apos;s about to live .
But the most important point is that whatever you you &apos;re <unk> , you &apos;re not going to do other .
The things that don &apos;t know that <unk> have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new <unk> of <unk> .
They &apos;re almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were just one kind of <unk> , and <unk> them from <unk> , they were <unk> , and they were <unk> , only after they were <unk> , and they were <unk> a lot of times , and they were going to be OK .
So I started <unk> a couple of new when the <unk> were gone , and I said , &quot; I &apos;ve got a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> said , &quot; Do you want to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
Do you want them with <unk> or with <unk> ? &quot; <unk> &quot; or &quot; <unk> &quot;
&quot; Do you want to <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> wants to <unk> or <unk> ? &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was <unk> , and I was able to say , &quot; I want the guy that was the only guy -- that was the only guy , &quot; he had no idea what this was , so for an hour , I would all be <unk> <unk> , and then I <unk> it , and then I <unk> it , and then I <unk> it , with the best <unk> of <unk> I ever had .
It was <unk> . I had all that choice was <unk> the best .
But I &apos;ll get worse .
Why ? I wrote a book <unk> to <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that I had all that choice my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I started <unk> . I didn &apos;t <unk> to me when I was just <unk> . But when I was just <unk> 100 different , <unk> , at least one , at least one , at least one of being perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
And after I got <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the lives of people &apos;s people not <unk> the <unk> that these have <unk> <unk> with respect to the <unk> of the <unk> .
And this is less <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of <unk> , it makes it <unk> .
Because if I <unk> it , I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The <unk> truth is more about this .
&quot; You were better when you were worse , &quot; The reason he was better when he was worse was when he was worse was even <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live in -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things to the <unk> of <unk> .
You &apos;ve never <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> are <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; Yes , you want to do it . &quot;
I mean -- little <unk> moment -- that I &apos;m really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn &apos;t do it better , I couldn &apos;t get <unk> .
But <unk> isn &apos;t always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> , a couple of <unk> <unk> when there &apos;s only that kind of <unk> is that when you &apos;re <unk> , and you &apos;re going to ask you , &quot; Why ? &quot;
Who is <unk> ? &quot; The answer is <unk> .
The world is <unk> . What could I do ?
When there &apos;s hundreds of <unk> , and you &apos;ll get a <unk> , and I &apos;ll tell you who &apos;s the <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> clear that the <unk> you are .
We could have done better .
With hundreds of <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even though the result , even though the result is <unk> , they <unk> and they give their own .
In the last few years , the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only one , but important -- of this <unk> <unk> is that people have experiences because the <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation think that <unk> is their own .
So the final result is that in general we &apos;re better , <unk> , but we &apos;re <unk> worse .
Let me show you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely <unk> . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no <unk> that a little bit of a choice is better than <unk> , but this doesn &apos;t <unk> that much choice is better than a while .
There &apos;s a <unk> value , <unk> . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve <unk> from a piece of the level that the choices <unk> our lives .
Now , from the <unk> <unk> -- I almost finished -- from the <unk> point of view , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What allows all of this choice in <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There &apos;s many places in the world , and you &apos;re <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice .
The problem is that they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I &apos;m talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> has talked about yesterday about how <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> of money .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , it &apos;s not that it &apos;s just <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
They do it .
If a little bit of what we do in our society allows choice to be <unk> in those where people have too many <unk> , it would not be the only one of their lives , but also our <unk> .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income is good at all -- not just to the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that <unk> us .
And to <unk> , &quot; <unk> , you can become everything you want to --
<unk> , people of culture , <unk> , &quot; What do you do that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s <unk> that you can &apos;t do anything in a glass of glass . &quot;
&quot; A <unk> imagination , a <unk> view of the world --
and I <unk> it , I <unk> it , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I realized that fish know the long knows that fish know it .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you <unk> the <unk> , so that &quot; everything is possible . &quot; You can &apos;t <unk> the freedom . You <unk> the <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> so that it can <unk> <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
They all need a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
