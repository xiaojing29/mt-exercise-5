<unk> year I showed these <unk> <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years had the size of the United States , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> of 40 percent .
I &apos;ll <unk> this <unk> <unk> of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a sense , the heart <unk> , the global system of climate change .
It <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You see , you see , it <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That &apos;s the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , five or more , is how blood , that &apos;s blood <unk> , which here is <unk> by the body .
It was 25 years on this way .
This is a problem because the <unk> is <unk> <unk> around the ocean , where there are huge amount of <unk> <unk> that , <unk> , are <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , that amount of <unk> , that amount of <unk> , <unk> this point of not <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is already <unk> by water .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : She &apos;s good . The question is if we <unk> it .
One reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the north .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> never <unk> like that .
This is the <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how to <unk> the sea level to <unk> on <unk> , here is where the sea <unk> .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> on the planet : <unk> , the largest <unk> of ice on the planet .
<unk> month scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of ice is in <unk> , and that the Western <unk> , which <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> at six feet of <unk> , like <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the third largest <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which few years ago were <unk> .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population <unk> half of <unk> water from that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : this <unk> is the source of <unk> water in this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
<unk> , when you <unk> , the same happens to <unk> water .
In California , <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> of 40 percent .
<unk> <unk> are in crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they &apos;re <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the world , <unk> to a <unk> increase in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> outside the normal and without <unk> .
<unk> times over <unk> in the last 30 years than <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the whole <unk> .
If you look at it in the <unk> context , you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we &apos;ve <unk> 70 million <unk> of every day , 25 million <unk> in the ocean every day .
Look at <unk> , area of the <unk> <unk> , from <unk> , to <unk> , and on both of the <unk> <unk> , where there is a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean .
The biggest cause of global warming , together with <unk> , which is 20 percent of them , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of two countries with more emissions , together with China .
And you <unk> to build a lot of <unk> <unk> .
But we &apos;re <unk> to a <unk> of direction .
These are the projects that have been <unk> in the last few years and some of <unk> <unk> .
Every way , there is a political <unk> in our country .
The <unk> of <unk> and <unk> oil have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I <unk> you have to do something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it on the <unk> .
This is the second largest flow in America .
It &apos;s happened around <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> the <unk> is a <unk> and happy .
It &apos;s <unk> here in America , and it &apos;s <unk> our economy .
<unk> the <unk> is always <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Al <unk> : From here , you get a lot of <unk> <unk> .
The greatest society <unk> on the <unk> <unk> is <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , one part of them .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> we see the changes as a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So our <unk> is <unk> a great amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> the truth to <unk> .
It actually , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it &apos;s <unk> -- it &apos;s got a good <unk> .
So we don &apos;t <unk> to climate change .
We want to do that .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you &apos;ve heard about it very much .
So we &apos;re going to take a <unk> structure as the <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> are a little <unk> , but this is the sound of <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> is between the <unk> <unk> of global <unk> , but the <unk> technology that you see changes everything .
<unk> a look at : this is the <unk> technology of <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic and the <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : America is in crisis ; <unk> , <unk> <unk> , national <unk> crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all the <unk> : our <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and the <unk> <unk> .
Now , but there &apos;s a new solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan to <unk> America at work , <unk> more <unk> , and help <unk> the global <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we start to solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
<unk> : This is the last one .
<unk> : It &apos;s about <unk> energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> , that we &apos;ll <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , a new network .
<unk> <unk> 2 : <unk> <unk> <unk> for jobs .
<unk> : <unk> America . It &apos;s time to be <unk> .
At the <unk> : A <unk> <unk> says , &quot; If you want to go to alone .
If you want to go far , you go , go together . &quot;
We have to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED I made a <unk> on <unk> .
And I try to <unk> <unk> on how the machine works .
So here we go . And for those who was the other time , there were no , the <unk> was the largest experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
<unk> is to <unk> the conditions that were there less than a <unk> of a second from the beginning of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second .
All of that is simply <unk> .
This is the <unk> machine .
<unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk> .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> <unk> feet and it has a <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> in construction in construction . So you can see the <unk> .
<unk> 10 <unk> last year .
And this picture was taken by <unk> .
It was because of <unk> <unk> in control room .
It &apos;s a <unk> picture of the first <unk> <unk> that had done everything around the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles in the <unk> .
In other words , when I <unk> that <unk> the <unk> machine , <unk> that the machine , which is a great <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if this was that to do <unk> that , when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the <unk> page was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a <unk> impact on the scientific .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to be right to these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> of <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you <unk> and <unk> , &quot; It &apos;s not true . I &apos;m <unk> too <unk> . I &apos;m <unk> too <unk> . &quot;
And they can do that because when they &apos;re very <unk> to become the <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees , at least a temperature temperature temperature <unk> to that space between stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> between the <unk> <unk> , there was a <unk> of <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and that are <unk> of about 30 <unk> .
It &apos;s about 50 <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
Now , they &apos;re <unk> now , they &apos;re <unk> to their <unk> place .
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> will be new <unk> .
I <unk> it , and we <unk> to get data to <unk> or <unk> , and keep on that our <unk> to find out what the universe are <unk> that we <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> on the value of science and engineering <unk> . It &apos;s easy to <unk> .
I think it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s the value of things like <unk> .
I &apos;d like to end with the words of a <unk> , <unk> , which , in <unk> <unk> of <unk> experiments of his <unk> , his <unk> was <unk> , and his <unk> was <unk> , and that we don &apos;t have <unk> to be <unk> to the progress of human mind how the science are <unk> , that we don &apos;t <unk> in nature , that our <unk> are <unk> , and that we don &apos;t have new <unk> .
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> <unk> in <unk> when , from children , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> <unk> like <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , actually <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> relationships .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way most of the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> <unk> with objects , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started to <unk> . I started to say , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> on a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> with both hands ,
and we start our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that I was going to try to explore the answer , building the <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a big <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a big <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , they can <unk> them , and they have a screen and they have a screen and a radio <unk> .
But <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> it .
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> the digital information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement of their movement , and as they become <unk> , <unk> of their <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , we can explore new <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ll start with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you some video , if you put it in a direction , the <unk> video , if you <unk> on the other side .
These <unk> are <unk> of other people .
If you <unk> them , you start to what &apos;s going around them .
If they come up , you <unk> and they can <unk> a little bit .
If they come up , you <unk> and they can <unk> a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We then realized that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was that we could use common <unk> on data , for example , &quot; <unk> &quot; a color like if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as <unk> of <unk> and I can <unk> it to <unk> the color in that central , where you <unk> .
and I can <unk> it to <unk> the color in that central .
And we can <unk> it too , we can <unk> a little bit .
I &apos;m also <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> , the mathematics and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> that are immediately <unk> .
I &apos;m --
This is a sequence of <unk> I do with a <unk> <unk> program .
Here we have a game of words that is half between <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> , <unk> a letter to <unk> , <unk> , every <unk> , at every <unk> , and <unk> a letter to case on every <unk> , and as I was <unk> <unk> on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try and <unk> .
Thank you .
Here are <unk> children in <unk> <unk> <unk> , I did <unk> them , and I <unk> a video .
They &apos;re very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things like this <unk> is that you don &apos;t have to give people many <unk> .
I just wanted to say , &quot; I &apos;ll say , &quot; I &apos;ll exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , right there .
It actually wanted to <unk> <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to build a tool for the <unk> of <unk> . He &apos;s <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
<unk> : <unk> is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now he brought a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! Yeah !
So , we <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with the final <unk> , and it can decide how you <unk> .
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with the final <unk> , and it can decide how you <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time to show you is a tool that made , which is a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> , that &apos;s recently done , to <unk> and <unk> music .
<unk> here are <unk> by <unk> like base , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of these has four different <unk> , and you can choose which to use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of your <unk> .
And we just <unk> by doing a sound , <unk> a <unk> sequence . &quot;
These are actually that you can control live , like <unk> and <unk> .
I &apos;ll start to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are actually <unk> as long as you have and <unk> , which <unk> to the whole sequence .
<unk> how it works .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> a base <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> in a series , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , on the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , on the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , on the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , other
Now , we &apos;re going to <unk> a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> : Now let &apos;s <unk> <unk> --
<unk> : And now I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> to the <unk> , so I can control the <unk> .
<unk> : I can <unk> the whole sequence <unk> time on one side or another .
<unk> : And now we <unk> the <unk> <unk> to give <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : I can <unk> the sequence &quot; <unk> &quot; to <unk> . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> it , <unk> , <unk> or more <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the whole sequence on the left the <unk> &quot; <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new <unk> <unk> <unk> and more <unk> to how our brain work and body .
And today , I &apos;ve been <unk> to show you one of this path , and also some <unk> that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to <unk> is that it &apos;s going to <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> with media , which <unk> in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m not seeing the time to talk to all of you .
I &apos;m a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love and my <unk> of my life .
And it doesn &apos;t look <unk> to me that you can change .
But , said this , something particular happened was <unk> in my life and in my career , that led me to <unk> the whole relationship with this job .
The particular thing is that I wrote this book , this <unk> called &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which , <unk> from my <unk> books , for some reason , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere we are now , people will <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I &apos;m going to be <unk> to me now and say , &quot; You don &apos;t fear of being able to do better ?
You &apos;re not afraid to keep writing for all life , and we could be able to create a book that can <unk> somebody ? &quot;
How could you <unk> to somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , <unk> than 20 years ago , when I was <unk> to say to people -- I was a <unk> -- I was a <unk> .
I was going to go to the same <unk> <unk> .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t <unk> to be able to have success ?
Are you not fear of the <unk> <unk> you ?
You &apos;re not afraid to do this <unk> for all life without any life , which nothing is going to come out and <unk> on a <unk> of <unk> dreams with the <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I fear of all those things .
I always <unk> fear .
And I &apos;m afraid of many other things that people could not <unk> .
As <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as I was , I was , and I was , I was going to say , &quot; What &apos;s why
Is it <unk> ?
It &apos;s <unk> that anyone who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel to do .
But what is about so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not ?
How my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I don &apos;t remember at once in his <unk> , if he was <unk> to be <unk> ?
It never -- that <unk> of <unk> John , how did it go ?
Don &apos;t <unk> that way , <unk> ?
<unk> , the engineers <unk> as a group of not have , in <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
We have enough , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> but <unk> of any kind , we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk> .
And another one that <unk> to look at the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often as they .
And the ones that are not <unk> to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before I die , in the last <unk> , said , &quot; Every my book has <unk> me a little bit more <unk> about this work of their life .
But we don &apos;t know when we say it , because we heard these things so long that we &apos;ve got these things so we have <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> , and that art , in some way , and that art , at the end , we always <unk> to the <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> to everybody here today is : you &apos;re <unk> with this idea ?
I &apos;ll just be good to you this thing -- because it &apos;s also going to be good for this <unk> .
I think it &apos;s <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s also <unk> and I don &apos;t want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better to <unk> our great <unk> to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> that I &apos;m in my career .
<unk> -- look -- look , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m about 40 years .
I still have about four <unk> of work in me .
And it &apos;s very <unk> that anything that &apos;s going to happen now in the world as the work that <unk> after the <unk> success of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we &apos;re all <unk> friends , is that my greatest <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> that my greatest <unk> is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> , thought !
You know , this is the kind of thought that leads to person to start <unk> at nine <unk> at the <unk> nine of the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I love to keep doing this work I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it looks like , after many <unk> , that the way we work to keep on doing is that we can <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to have to find a distance between me , which I &apos;m <unk> , and my natural <unk> on what I was writing about what I was writing about what I was going to do is to look through the time , how to look at the time , trying to find other society to see if we had to have better ideas and more <unk> than that year , trying to find other society to see whether we have better ideas and more <unk> than
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research led me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s because you go to <unk> and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don &apos;t believe that creativity is <unk> creativity , OK ?
It turns out that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for reasons and <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> you have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> were of the same idea , but we <unk> that sort of <unk> <unk> body .
which is <unk> , because <unk> really <unk> really <unk> that a <unk> was particularly <unk> .
I was <unk> that a <unk> was this sort of <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> literally in the <unk> of an artist , a little <unk> like the <unk> , and I <unk> out to <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the <unk> of that I was working on .
<unk> <unk> , that &apos;s the distance I &apos;m talking about -- that <unk> <unk> you from the results of your work .
And everybody <unk> that was so <unk> , right ?
So , artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like , for example , right ?
If your work was <unk> not to <unk> all the <unk> , you all know that you &apos;ve got to <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it was not to your whole , right ?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and everything , and we <unk> this great idea ; we put this great idea ; we put the human being at the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and no longer to leave space on the <unk> .
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people started thinking that creativity is completely <unk> by <unk> .
And for the first time in history , you start to <unk> this or that artist as a <unk> to a rather than a <unk> with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think I &apos;ll be <unk> to somebody , a simple person to believe that they &apos;re like a source , the source of all the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> <unk> to the human <unk> .
It &apos;s like to ask somebody to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> the <unk> and creates all of these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure to have been this pressure to have been this pressure to be 500 years old .
And , if that &apos;s true , and I think it &apos;s , the question becomes , and I &apos;m going to be now ?
Can we do it <unk> ?
They want to go back to a more <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t <unk> 500 years of thinking about in a <unk> <unk> .
And there are probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> , you do that <unk> people <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> their projects .
You probably won &apos;t tell you all about this .
But the question I &apos;d like to ask you to <unk> is -- why not ?
Why not we &apos;re not going to happen to this way ?
Because more sense of everything that ever heard of to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process .
A process that , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so basically , everybody here -- you know , you don &apos;t <unk> <unk> .
And in fact , it can sometimes seem completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , who has now 90 years , but that was a <unk> for all of life and said that during his <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
He said , he was like a <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> to her <unk> .
<unk> it to get it , because he was <unk> the earth under his feet .
I decided to have one thing to do at that point and was , words , &quot; <unk> like a <unk> . &quot;
And so he went back to home and he was <unk> by this <unk> , and he would have no other that take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> , and he <unk> on the page .
<unk> times you can &apos;t get enough to be <unk> , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and she would <unk> her <unk> through and she would <unk> through the <unk> , looking , as she said , &quot; Another <unk> . &quot;
Then there were times -- this piece never -- there were times -- there were times when the time was almost <unk> , OK ?
So , he was <unk> at home and he was looking for paper and he was trying to <unk> her through , and then he <unk> a <unk> right in the while he was <unk> with the other hand and <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and <unk> in his body and <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the page , and <unk> , but to the <unk> , from the word to the first word .
So when I <unk> <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not all my <unk> process -- I &apos;m not a <unk> !
I &apos;m a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; I &apos;m <unk> to <unk> and work and work and <unk> and work on top of it .
But even I , in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I would say that many of you have to do it .
You know , even though the work and ideas <unk> me <unk> from a certain source I could not <unk> <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it in a way we don &apos;t have to <unk> it , but rather , that it <unk> us <unk> ?
As I think , the best example of the <unk> I have <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I <unk> different years ago for a <unk> .
I was talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the artist <unk> <unk> , trying to control , <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , he <unk> , and he was <unk> on a day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , <unk> everything .
<unk> <unk> and everything from a <unk> <unk> , and everything is <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> , and he comes in his head like <unk> , and <unk> , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the <unk> , but it doesn &apos;t know how to <unk> .
It has no <unk> piece , no <unk> , he has no <unk> , he has no <unk> .
So , he starts to hear this kind of old <unk> <unk> in him like , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose it from this <unk> song .
I &apos;m not <unk> enough and I can &apos;t <unk> it . &quot;
And instead of going to go to the <unk> , they <unk> .
<unk> the whole process and made something completely new .
I just just <unk> the sky and said , &quot; <unk> , you see that I &apos;m <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Do it seem to write a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you &apos;re going to get a little bit <unk> when I can <unk> care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> more <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And his <unk> process <unk> <unk> after this .
It wasn &apos;t the work , it was still <unk> as always as well .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> <unk> , that he had to be <unk> out of where he was , that he had to be <unk> and <unk> .
but I was going to <unk> this , wonderful <unk> <unk> <unk> a conversation between this and this <unk> thing , but it was not <unk> .
And as I was <unk> that story to change some way I was going to change some way I was <unk> and I already <unk> .
This idea , I was <unk> when I was <unk> , I was <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and I was in one of those <unk> of the <unk> that we &apos;re working on something and we don &apos;t , and we can start thinking that it will be a <unk> , which will be the <unk> book , which will be the <unk> book .
Not only <unk> , just the <unk> book .
And we started thinking about this project .
But then I was <unk> to <unk> that <unk> to the air and <unk> .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and I <unk> my face to a <unk> corner of the room .
And I said <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , what , both of them , and we know that book won &apos;t be <unk> my , right ?
Because you see , I &apos;m <unk> to you see that I &apos;m not going to be that I &apos;m not going to do that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , I don &apos;t <unk> anything .
I started writing the same because it &apos;s my work .
And I &apos;d like to please , you know , I &apos;m <unk> to do my part . &quot; Because finally , &quot; <unk> -- <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK -- <unk> it <unk> in the <unk> of Africa , the people <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , and music that we <unk> <unk> for hours to <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every while , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> .
And I know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you &apos;ve got everybody , at some point , you know , at some point , you know , a <unk> .
It was like , if you were <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> through some sort of <unk> and he was not doing anything different from the time , like the <unk> <unk> <unk> before , but it was <unk> .
And suddenly it doesn &apos;t just <unk> as a human as a human .
But it <unk> up from <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , he <unk> his name .
<unk> your hand and <unk> to <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , &quot; God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , they <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
In <unk> , when a <unk> artist did something impossible , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it &apos;s because we need .
But , the problem comes the day , the <unk> , when you <unk> and <unk> and <unk> that are the 11 of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of God , there &apos;s no more .
It &apos;s simply a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> , and perhaps never <unk> to that <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still while I was going to do is , and what has to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But perhaps it doesn &apos;t have to be so <unk> if you start not believe , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , that the most <unk> <unk> of your being from yourself .
But let me just <unk> you that data from a <unk> of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk> when you &apos;re finished .
And , you know , if we think about it in this way , it &apos;s going to change it .
And so I started <unk> , and it &apos;s certainly how I <unk> it for several months in the <unk> of the book that was soon , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> of my success .
And what I have to keep <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , I &apos;m not afraid to fear .
Don &apos;t <unk> . You just don &apos;t just want your work .
<unk> <unk> for your <unk> , whatever it can be .
If your work is <unk> , you know .
If you <unk> , you &apos;ll <unk> <unk> you to <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for one moment through your <unk> , then you know , then you &apos;re going to go , &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
<unk> , you do the same <unk> your <unk> .
And I said , &quot; You know , you know , same .
I think , and I think , you know , I think , and I think it &apos;s <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; I &apos;m going to give you the same , even for having human love and <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects on the human genome , on what it can <unk> and discovery of <unk> new genes .
We &apos;re now <unk> a new path to <unk> biology and now starting from that digital code we &apos;re <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , we &apos;re <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We have always tried to <unk> big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; It &apos;s something that many <unk> I think they have <unk> to understand various <unk> .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> terms .
We &apos;re <unk> from almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> <unk> from the world <unk> of the computer .
Now , we &apos;re going to <unk> life , or create new life on this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the most small species from the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to <unk> <unk> the genome to <unk> a little bit more small .
We &apos;re able to <unk> a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that are here .
But when we look at his <unk> map , it &apos;s simple than our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at a time , it &apos;s very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell .
So we thought that the only way away to <unk> this <unk> in a way that we <unk> <unk> to <unk> some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of &quot; <unk> we can <unk> a <unk> ? &quot;
Can the chemistry <unk> of these great molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create these great molecules that we &apos;ve never been able to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is simply a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> with which we &apos;re able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> .
Our ability to write the code , instead , <unk> , <unk> rather slowly , but it &apos;s <unk> .
And our most <unk> results <unk> on a <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve got over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> many <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before we <unk> the experiments .
But we &apos;ve discovered that DNA <unk> is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that little <unk> of DNA <unk> , of <unk> <unk> <unk> and it &apos;s a <unk> process : the <unk> is a <unk> process : the longer <unk> is there .
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , starting from the digital information of <unk> genome .
It &apos;s a little <unk> that <unk> bacteria .
We designed <unk> , we <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of about <unk> <unk> .
And what &apos;s interesting about when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> it in the bacteria , bacteria have <unk> to read this <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> particles .
The <unk> particles have been <unk> by cells , they have <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I talked about recently with members of the <unk> industry that they have certainly <unk> this model .
They have more <unk> than you .
<unk> that this is a situation where the software can actually <unk> its same <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we could do things about the greatest things .
They wanted to build the whole <unk> of <unk> .
They &apos;re more than <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> code .
So we thought we &apos;d <unk> to <unk> in the size of the virus , so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> are the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if we <unk> with information <unk> in a computer , they have to be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time , the <unk> <unk> was of a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve discovered , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If we were used that sequence never <unk> <unk> to do it .
One of the process is design <unk> <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of the <unk> <unk> to build smaller <unk> than <unk> .
<unk> elements here .
You &apos;ve probably read that you have read that <unk> us from <unk> .
So , we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> on four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , and there &apos;s a <unk> order of <unk> for every <unk> .
So we can use the <unk> code for writing , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did was at the beginning was <unk> .
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started <unk> parts , <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
At any step we have produced these <unk> <unk> in <unk> , that we &apos;re <unk> to create a very <unk> <unk> , as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to <unk> the process .
So , this looks like the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When you start to these <unk> <unk> , much more than 100 <unk> <unk> , no longer we go to the <unk> <unk> .
It comes to the <unk> of the <unk> tools of <unk> biology .
So we have <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA that can <unk> the <unk> .
Here &apos;s an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , it can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> like his <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
In 12 hours , 24 hours , it &apos;s exactly like before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can completely <unk> .
You have to live under <unk> .
They &apos;re absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and they &apos;re <unk> to find new <unk> <unk> of water .
In fact , NASA <unk> showed that this happens .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we &apos;ve built these <unk> , simply using the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s such a great <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that we &apos;ll have a period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we &apos;ve done very little time ago .
They &apos;re more than <unk> <unk> of <unk> code .
It &apos;s the largest <unk> of a <unk> structure ever <unk> by man .
It has a <unk> <unk> on 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 <unk> , you &apos;ll just <unk> pages just to <unk> this <unk> code .
Now , how do we do it work ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> is a <unk> game .
It &apos;s a little bit <unk> when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s <unk> cells , even when it comes from <unk> cells like our : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the process of <unk> .
In <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> in the cell , but we &apos;ve <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re able to do a <unk> <unk> from a cell to another and of <unk> .
We have <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> species .
The two different are how men from <unk> .
We &apos;ve <unk> some <unk> <unk> more <unk> in a way that you choose to choose what to choose to do .
He then <unk> it up with <unk> <unk> in a way that <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> went to the <unk> .
And we could <unk> <unk> that we don &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to <unk> them .
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution .
We &apos;ve discovered that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere , you &apos;ll <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So who think about evolution as a <unk> only <unk> at a time that <unk> doesn &apos;t really understand a lot of biology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> DNA .
The <unk> that was in the cell , not <unk> one .
<unk> <unk> we <unk> it .
It &apos;s <unk> , and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material , he <unk> it , and we went with only the cell and the new <unk> .
It has become blue because of the genes that we have <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species , and it &apos;s <unk> of the whole new software that we &apos;ve <unk> in the new software that we &apos;ve <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code exactly what we &apos;ve <unk> .
Now , this could look <unk> <unk> , but we <unk> the software DNA we can change things in a way that we can change things in a way that we can change things in a way that you can change things in a way that could <unk> things .
Now , I &apos;ve already <unk> that we &apos;re not talking about <unk> -- but of progress from three million years and a half million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> in which we &apos;re going to create new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion people to <unk> billion in the next 40 years .
Just to give you an example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> in <unk> ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re going to get <unk> to find food , water and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> for six and a half billion people .
It &apos;s going to be even more <unk> to do this for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , over 30 billion <unk> , over 30 billion <unk> .
That means 100 million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process of <unk> , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
In the <unk> we have to realize that we have to be more than these materials that we &apos;re <unk> in the atmosphere .
At the day today , through the <unk> <unk> <unk> all over the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are <unk> for the future .
The <unk> <unk> only one of the <unk> <unk> , and think how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from reality and our imagination .
We have now <unk> , thank you to these <unk> <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think of these 20 million genes , or <unk> to try to <unk> the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , with a small team , and create more biology that we can <unk> biology .
And it &apos;s just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to choose <unk> , chemistry or chemistry , or chemistry , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we &apos;re working on to be able to <unk> and design and design species on the computer .
Well , we don &apos;t know how they &apos;re going to be .
We know exactly what their <unk> code .
We &apos;re going to <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
You saw this one that <unk> <unk> from <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We have <unk> <unk> <unk> and third generation that we &apos;ll get enough to <unk> from <unk> to <unk> more <unk> like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> to <unk> the CO2 in matter before , which we &apos;re working on for cells to design this , and we think we can be able to have the first <unk> of <unk> in 18 months .
<unk> solar <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> , we &apos;ve found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> we <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> in the deep ocean , about <unk> meters <unk> to the temperature of <unk> water .
It <unk> <unk> hydrogen <unk> as hydrogen as <unk> energy .
We &apos;re trying to figure out whether we can easily be <unk> by <unk> , which can easily be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So we think that we might be able to <unk> what the basic question , &quot; which is the basic <unk> , &quot; which is life . We have the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole <unk> .
<unk> . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t do that from TED , where you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t do it from TED , where you can &apos;t do it from TED , you ?
It <unk> a <unk> source of energy .
<unk> , we &apos;re working on the same <unk> to use the same <unk> to create <unk> .
You saw this year with flu <unk> , we always go back to a year and with a dollar less <unk> when it comes to find the right <unk> .
I think that you can change <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
That &apos;s how the future could start looking <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> the evolution with <unk> , <unk> , and finally cells .
We &apos;re at so <unk> people .
Our purpose is to do in a way of living on a long way to try to <unk> it . Thank you very much .
First of all , I &apos;m going to show you , the <unk> possible , some <unk> work , some <unk> , the new technology that we took to <unk> almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
It &apos;s about an environment where you can <unk> is at local level that we <unk> with a huge amount of data <unk> .
Here we &apos;re seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a <unk> <unk> , <unk> the images like we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much it &apos;s the amount of information that we see , how big data or images .
Most of them are common photographs , but this is a <unk> <unk> by the <unk> , and you <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in any moment . It &apos;s also very <unk> architecture .
This is a book , which is not images .
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
So , you know , it &apos;s just text and not images , we can do something like this , to actually see that it &apos;s really a real <unk> <unk> , not a picture .
It could be a little bit <unk> to read a little <unk> book .
I &apos;m not going to <unk> you .
This is an <unk> example . This is about a <unk> number of <unk> .
Every image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the <unk> and the <unk> experience to read the real <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is nature for a <unk> , which is to nature kind of a half of them .
We also made something with the corner of this particular number of The <unk> of the <unk> .
We &apos;ve created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much <unk> than that you use in a normal <unk> and we <unk> the content .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see it here .
Or even other models , or even the <unk> <unk> .
And that really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
I &apos;ll say that this <unk> <unk> to the <unk> and other <unk> <unk> , not to be <unk> .
Of course , <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this one I don &apos;t want to lose time , if we don &apos;t want to say that we have <unk> <unk> to give it in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> on a NASA <unk> .
So now , let &apos;s start to something else .
This is actually live on the web ; you can <unk> to see .
It &apos;s about a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other one is a very interesting <unk> of the computer interesting computer that was made by <unk> <unk> , a <unk> student of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s live on the web , <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of experience <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of images here actually a meaning .
So , the <unk> <unk> of the computer have <unk> these images together , so that we <unk> to the <unk> places that <unk> all <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk> . Here you see some of the elements of a <unk> or <unk> <unk> , and these things have been all <unk> at the <unk> level .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> data <unk> and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that we &apos;ve done for the first time , the summer , to show you what &apos;s really the key to show you what &apos;s really the key to show you what &apos;s really the key to do is to show the key <unk> that we have to do in the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> and so on .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> images . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and saying . <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> an image that <unk> <unk> an image that has been discovery .
So they &apos;re all <unk> images and have all <unk> <unk> in this way .
And it &apos;s possible to <unk> this <unk> .
You know , I would never thought of it to end up to work to <unk> .
It &apos;s very <unk> to <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think we &apos;ll see that it &apos;s about a lot of different kinds of <unk> : that are <unk> <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> together , <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I can get those <unk> <unk> .
A lot of are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
<unk> there is a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from <unk> to <unk> physics of this environment .
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now <unk> data from <unk> <unk> by the whole memory <unk> of how the earth the <unk> , from the <unk> <unk> and <unk> all of those together .
All those pictures become <unk> together , and more than the <unk> of the parts .
You have a model of the Earth .
Think about this as the <unk> of <unk> <unk> on Earth .
It &apos;s something that we &apos;re going to <unk> hand , that people will <unk> it , and the that we &apos;re going to <unk> with use .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> by other people .
If somebody comes the idea of <unk> all of these <unk> <unk> , I &apos;m going to take you <unk> , my <unk> <unk> <unk> of all of those data , and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> to <unk> in the space , using the pictures of anyone else , and have an experience of <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
Now , of course , a <unk> of all that are extremely <unk> of every part of the Earth , not only just by <unk> and <unk> images and <unk> images and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand it well ? What &apos;s your software will be doing is that at some point , in the next few years , all the <unk> <unk> <unk> , all the <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is we &apos;re going to find out .
It &apos;s creating <unk> , if you want , you want , in images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the <unk> content .
And what it becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> of information that many of these <unk> images .
As you get a <unk> research on the web , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the web has a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture <unk> all your photos ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> <unk> that <unk> is really huge . It &apos;s a <unk> effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it &apos;s really amazing . <unk> .
<unk> : I &apos;m going to give you a lot of .
One of the major <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> of <unk> research is the way that we can live in the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> in the <unk> , the <unk> in the <unk> , the <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of plants .
You think that <unk> <unk> will be <unk> still beyond the <unk> <unk> , or that the <unk> <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , or <unk> , or in <unk> , or in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , and that the idea that the world that we live in there is no sense , but it &apos;s just a model , it &apos;s just a <unk> of reality ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> did , good or bad , many <unk> , many <unk> ago .
And , of course , everybody <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Everybody is <unk> . Everybody <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We have to <unk> the death <unk> , so we don &apos;t know if we were and <unk> --
We all have an art .
What <unk> is the particular <unk> of the song , the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that it &apos;s the <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> .
He was my <unk> <unk> in the <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the mother <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of the world .
All of these <unk> are <unk> that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of moving moving moving around the world .
And , if you <unk> a second , it &apos;s a concept that it can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and <unk> that <unk> the planet and is important to the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> known as <unk> as <unk> .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the total <unk> of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , ideas , ideas , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in being by human imagination , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being by human imagination .
<unk> is the great <unk> of humanity .
It &apos;s the <unk> of what we can be , and what we can be as <unk> species .
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> was success to the <unk> and <unk> very quickly .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or is about the <unk> of <unk> , just because it &apos;s <unk> , or -- in the <unk> <unk> -- in the <unk> diversity -- and you don &apos;t even understand a little bit of <unk> -- that &apos;s not <unk> <unk> -- that &apos;s not <unk> <unk> <unk> -- that &apos;s <unk> -- that &apos;s not even <unk> <unk> -- that &apos;s the <unk> of <unk> .
The <unk> of that is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
One language is not just <unk> just a <unk> or a series of rules .
One language is the <unk> of human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle with the <unk> that the <unk> of every culture comes in the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we &apos;re here at <unk> , at least half not <unk> in the <unk> of children .
They &apos;re not <unk> to children , which means not something that &apos;s already <unk> , which are already <unk> .
What is more <unk> than the <unk> of being <unk> by <unk> , of being the last few <unk> to speak a language , of the <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> or <unk> the <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of somebody in a few weeks , every two weeks of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> with them in the <unk> <unk> , and he <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> language .
And I know somebody of you say , &quot; Don &apos;t that good ?
The world would not be a better place if we <unk> all the same language ? &quot; <unk> , then we &apos;re all talking about . &quot;
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> of a <unk> thing that means that we can &apos;t talk their own language .
I &apos;d like to do you to do a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we &apos;re <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say , &quot; different ways of <unk> , &quot; I really want different ways of <unk> .
<unk> for example , this <unk> <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , which <unk> the <unk> of <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s not able to <unk> the blue color from green , because the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> , which we <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; You have to <unk> a person talking about a language .
All of that has <unk> in the past , though , the <unk> is that in these <unk> <unk> , where you &apos;re talking about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> nobody <unk> .
It &apos;s about listening and then I &apos;ll start to talk .
I was going to give one of the most interesting <unk> that I lived , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , an amazing <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;ve done <unk> by the <unk> photographs that <unk> them in <unk> that <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> had never seen anything .
They &apos;ve <unk> the pictures from the land , they <unk> the research <unk> or a <unk> , not <unk> anything , they have <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with the <unk> .
But the <unk> not only <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> with them .
<unk> percent <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We went to eight <unk> and we found two cases of natural death and when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was so <unk> that he died , and then they <unk> it . They <unk> <unk> <unk> . They <unk> <unk> <unk> . They <unk> <unk> , and then they <unk> it .
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> species .
<unk> years old , I was actually <unk> a really interesting task when my <unk> <unk> <unk> , if I was going to go to <unk> between the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
To make sense to <unk> , I should have to understand the culture , and that <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s pretty about a <unk> <unk> view of the world .
<unk> <unk> .
If you ask me to <unk> the great <unk> of the world , what would you like ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that Africa <unk> doesn &apos;t have <unk> <unk> . And instead of yes and the <unk> is nothing else that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> very <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes interesting is that the <unk> between life and death .
So , <unk> do <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by <unk> <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> of alive so that for a moment the <unk> .
For this one of the <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> go to <unk> to the God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . &quot;
And since you &apos;re <unk> , is the spirit that <unk> you , how do you get <unk> ?
So , you start to these incredible events : <unk> in the state of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather strong <unk> of the power of mind on the body when it was <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> that I lived the most <unk> <unk> are the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> <unk> that once <unk> <unk> <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> never had been <unk> by <unk> .
In fact , I &apos;m <unk> today are <unk> by a <unk> , but their education is extraordinary <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> away from <unk> to <unk> , and they &apos;re four years in a world that was <unk> and <unk> in a world that has been <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the base of the <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> of nine years <unk> <unk> by the nine months of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of the mother , now are <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
For all this time , they &apos;re <unk> to the values of their society , values that they <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> .
In the <unk> , this <unk> <unk> , they come out and for the first time , they see a <unk> <unk> . And in that moment of <unk> <unk> , <unk> . And that moment of <unk> <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk> , everything that they learned in <unk> <unk> , everything that they learned in the theory is <unk> . The <unk> <unk> ago , and says :
&quot; <unk> ? <unk> as I said .
It &apos;s <unk> . Now it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
They call the major <unk> and they say that we are , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think about the <unk> <unk> and the old story of the <unk> <unk> , and the old story of the <unk> <unk> , or maybe <unk> and say that these <unk> are <unk> to the Earth .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> <unk> by <unk> .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> , but by the time and the <unk> , have created a <unk> of the Earth , we &apos;re <unk> not on the concept of <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> : the concept that the Earth can only be living because it is by human <unk> .
What does it mean ?
I mean , a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> the mountain is a very different <unk> and <unk> <unk> its <unk> will be a different relationship and going to have a <unk> relationship with the mountain or that place to be <unk> with a <unk> of <unk> that we could be <unk> .
<unk> is <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is that the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
That made me a different human being from my <unk> friends that believe that the <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> .
If we start to <unk> that these <unk> can actually create different , we start to understand some of them <unk> <unk> . They <unk> this <unk> .
I took this picture at <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What makes fascinating is not the potential <unk> is <unk> <unk> , but his <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> by two elements .
From one hand , this <unk> <unk> <unk> that has a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> you have a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit of <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> with a <unk> of a <unk> of the family <unk> said ,
This <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you &apos;re going to see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> that make a different <unk> , it <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . &#91; <unk> &#93;
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of the <unk> <unk> in the &apos; <unk> in the &apos; <unk> .
<unk> to my <unk> , you can &apos;t <unk> these <unk> as <unk> , because if you &apos;re done , you can &apos;t tell anybody to be <unk> . <unk> , but they can &apos;t be <unk> because they &apos;re <unk> by a <unk> that &apos;s <unk> in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s possible to <unk> <unk> only if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now , it &apos;s a good thing : the <unk> that are <unk> in this <unk> <unk> , the same kind of <unk> <unk> . The question <unk> : in a <unk> <unk> , <unk> . The question <unk> : in a <unk> of plants , how do these <unk> <unk> <unk> , they make these <unk> <unk> <unk> , they make a <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you go to the <unk> , we &apos;ll <unk> , we &apos;ll talk about plants .
What does it mean ?
This <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that our eyes in the same species .
If you <unk> them as you <unk> their <unk> , they will <unk> us , &quot; <unk> <unk> , you don &apos;t know everything ? &quot; I said , &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take the <unk> <unk> in a <unk> of the moon and <unk> with a different <unk> .
And with this <unk> , you can &apos;t <unk> , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> .
Now , the problem is that the ones that have to us who have to heart <unk> <unk> them , but somehow we <unk> to the <unk> of the history of our real world , and <unk> <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , not <unk> <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk> , but rather like the was that we <unk> and we have <unk> <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> diversity and <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the diversity of the <unk> diversity and <unk> the planet . Now the problem is not the change change .
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a new chance of life .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , they have <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> <unk> and <unk> like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It &apos;s the power .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And if you look at a look at the world , you know that these are not <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> and <unk> <unk> out of <unk> forces that go beyond their ability to <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> , a <unk> that lived in the forest until a generation ago , and now we &apos;re going to <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that seems to be <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> ,
<unk> to <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> .
If we <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> , where I &apos;m doing many research , you &apos;ll see the <unk> <unk> of politics .
As <unk> <unk> , <unk> physics , <unk> physics , is <unk> to <unk> , but the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> of <unk> life , not only is <unk> , but <unk> in some <unk> , because it &apos;s a lot of development .
And you can &apos;t understand the <unk> <unk> until you get <unk> out of the beginning .
I <unk> miles from <unk> miles from <unk> in China , through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> <unk> to <unk> me understand what I understand .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> at the <unk> <unk> .
which means that it &apos;s been <unk> to the Chinese times in the <unk> time .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that led the <unk> <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and her <unk> was <unk> .
It was taken by <unk> in <unk> at <unk> at the age of two <unk> under his <unk> , because he couldn &apos;t live without him .
The <unk> , which has done the same , was <unk> in <unk> .
One day he <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to work for seven years .
The pain of the <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> of <unk> is from there .
At the end , it &apos;s all about a choice .
<unk> to live in the world of <unk> or we want to <unk> the world of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died said that his greatest fear was that , in our <unk> <unk> to this <unk> view of the world , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination to <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of thought , but a day we <unk> us from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it &apos;s <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , which <unk> us <unk> to the <unk> , which has made us <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has to <unk> 300 years .
The <unk> story I didn &apos;t tell you that we have the answers to all the challenges that we <unk> to come .
When you know , these <unk> <unk> of the world , what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all <unk> the chance of being what we are : a <unk> species , that has to <unk> that all the <unk> and all the <unk> that are <unk> . And there are great times of <unk> .
I took this picture on the <unk> <unk> <unk> , when I went to <unk> with <unk> <unk> , and this man , <unk> me , and this man , <unk> , <unk> me , he <unk> the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The government <unk> wasn &apos;t always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the &apos; <unk> to <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> for his life , <unk> away all the <unk> , and all of his <unk> .
You want to know that <unk> don &apos;t <unk> the cold , you know .
The <unk> <unk> were made of <unk> fish were made fish <unk> in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn &apos;t <unk> <unk> from night or <unk> that <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> away , it &apos;s <unk> the <unk> <unk> in the skin of <unk> and <unk> in their hand . When I did <unk> , he <unk> them by , he <unk> it by <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when he <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> created a <unk> , he <unk> another dog and he &apos;s <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> you talk to <unk> with nothing ? &#91; <unk> &#93; And this , in different ways , &#91; <unk> &#93; is the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> the government <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> control of an area of larger California and <unk> <unk> together .
It &apos;s their new <unk> . It &apos;s called <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s about all the <unk> resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> at least <unk> at least , at least , let me realize that they &apos;re not <unk> at all .
For somebody is home .
<unk> <unk> of human imagination that <unk> at the time . And for us all , the dreams of these children , as the dreams of our children , they become part of hope .
<unk> , we &apos;re <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> never to anything .
I would say that the <unk> --
&#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; They &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; , but we believe that stories can change the world , and perhaps we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our website <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public in places to bring our public places to <unk> from which they <unk> away from which they &apos;ve seen and , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , for a <unk> world of <unk> within a <unk> world , and we have to find a <unk> world and <unk> .
where the <unk> of all of the <unk> can <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I hope you &apos;ve heard and <unk> some <unk> , in the case you &apos;re not going to <unk> them .
I &apos;d like to start with what I call &quot; the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
<unk> <unk> what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> : If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens . &quot; The way to do it is <unk> freedom . &quot;
The reason is , on one side , in fact that freedom is itself a value , is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , for human beings .
<unk> else is going to do anything in the fact that if we &apos;re <unk> , we &apos;re all going to <unk> our <unk> , no one that we would <unk> our <unk> , no one that we would <unk> to our <unk> , no one that we &apos;re <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> , each of us can act for ourselves to do anything that we love our <unk> , and we can do anything that we do with our <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> ,
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> the choice .
More choices , people have , more they are <unk> , and more <unk> of the <unk> , the more of the <unk> .
This , <unk> , it &apos;s so <unk> <unk> in society that nobody has <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it &apos;s also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to give you a simple note on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> and the 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> that nobody has already been <unk> to you in your <unk> .
That &apos;s what the <unk> is .
Then go to the <unk> store for <unk> <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a great number of <unk> <unk> .
We can do six and half million different <unk> of <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one <unk> .
<unk> <unk> there is choice .
<unk> <unk> : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the <unk> services , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It <unk> the phone , you don &apos;t <unk> it .
A <unk> of that , in the other , was that the phone never <unk> .
These days , they went .
We have now a <unk> <unk> <unk> , especially between cell phones .
Here is <unk> <unk> .
My <unk> is that in the middle , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
If you haven &apos;t seen it in the <unk> <unk> , you &apos;re very soon certain that we &apos;re going to get some <unk> that soon .
And what happens to be people <unk> in the <unk> and they do this question . And you know , what &apos;s the answer is , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t make things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , you <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : It &apos;s not going on in the United States that you &apos;re <unk> from <unk> and the <unk> you &apos;ve got to do .
But , you go from <unk> , and the <unk> says , &quot; OK , we could do it , or <unk> , &quot; A <unk> <unk> and these <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> these <unk> and these <unk> . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You were saying , &quot; <unk> , what would you do ? &quot;
And the <unk> says , &quot; A <unk> <unk> these <unk> , and <unk> <unk> these <unk> and <unk> these <unk> . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; <unk> if you were me , what would you say ? &quot;
And the <unk> , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call it &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; , <unk> that makes it look like a great thing .
But actually , it &apos;s not that a <unk> the <unk> and the responsibility for the <unk> of <unk> that you know something , <unk> the <unk> , to somebody else that doesn &apos;t know -- and so that we don &apos;t know -- and so in the <unk> <unk> to make decisions , the patient .
There &apos;s a huge <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> to people like me and you , that if you think about it , you don &apos;t think it makes any sense , because we can &apos;t <unk> .
But if we can &apos;t <unk> , why would we <unk> them ?
The answer is , which they want to <unk> that we call the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> of so <unk> is our <unk> now is a question of choice , how we see in this <unk> . &quot; We want to <unk> the children . They want to <unk> their sex . We &apos;re not going to be a <unk> : we have to <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times we get there .
which means that every <unk> , at <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
<unk> to the family and <unk> , a time the common perspective , almost for anyone , was that we had to get the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> to <unk> them to be possible .
The only one that real choice was with who , not , and what to do after .
<unk> , it &apos;s really to play .
<unk> to students very smart , and they <unk> their 20 percent <unk> less than a time .
And not because they &apos;re less <unk> , not because they &apos;re less <unk> .
but why am I <unk> , I &apos;m going to ask you , &quot; <unk> or not ? <unk> ? I &apos;m going to do it now ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> later ? I have to think before or children ? I have to think before or a ? &quot;
I &apos;m <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this <unk> doesn &apos;t <unk> the <unk> that I don &apos;t get a great <unk> to my <unk> .
And they really have to do that . They &apos;re important questions .
Now , the work : we &apos;re <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because technology <unk> us to work every minute , from every day , from every corner of the planet , <unk> that from the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> , and I &apos;m not going to tell anyone who , where the <unk> works .
I &apos;m not saying , because I want to use it .
What does it mean , this incredible choice of choice we have to decide , <unk> , <unk> every time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son , with the mobile phone , with a <unk> , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , on the <unk> .
And even though they &apos;re all <unk> , every minute that we see our son <unk> , we &apos;re also <unk> , &quot; I have to answer this to be ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> I have to answer this <unk> ? I got to <unk> this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , that &apos;s all about your <unk> son of your <unk> son very different from what would be in other conditions .
So , any <unk> , we look at , little , things and great , and <unk> and objects , life is a question of choices .
And once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibility , but not everything was about choice .
The world today &apos;s going to be here today to this : <unk> is , or <unk> ?
The answer is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about those <unk> .
<unk> this choice <unk> two effects of people on people .
The first one , <unk> , is that it <unk> instead of <unk> .
With a lot of <unk> that you choose , it &apos;s very difficult to do it .
I &apos;ll give you an example of a <unk> example : a <unk> study <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of my <unk> has had access to data , the <unk> <unk> society , with about a million <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> more , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s 10 percent less than it &apos;s only about five to them . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> <unk> between which choice is , is difficult to decide , and choice is <unk> to the <unk> .
And <unk> , and still <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> never comes up .
<unk> that means not only that these <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don &apos;t have enough money , even want to say that the decision is so <unk> that we also <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re not <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> until five to <unk> <unk> , which would be <unk> <unk> .
So , <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices .
And I think we &apos;ll <unk> the world like this .
&quot; And finally , to end the <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
You just want to make the right decision , if it &apos;s for <unk> , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong <unk> , and you &apos;ll get the wrong <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second effect is that even if we can <unk> <unk> and make choice , at the end , we &apos;re less <unk> by the result of how we &apos;ve been <unk> with less <unk> than we choose .
And that for different reasons .
One of them is that with a lot of <unk> between you , and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s really easy to imagine that we could have a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the decision , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the decision , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by the decision , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by the decision ,
even when it was a <unk> decision .
More choices there are , <unk> , it &apos;s easier to <unk> than any <unk> that is <unk> of choice .
<unk> , there &apos;s what <unk> call <unk> call .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well <unk> how the value we <unk> things from what we <unk> .
<unk> , you know , when there are lots of <unk> , it &apos;s easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and be less <unk> than the <unk> that is choice .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m going to <unk> with everyone who &apos;s not in New York .
But that &apos;s what you &apos;re probably going to be <unk> .
There &apos;s this <unk> to the <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . It &apos;s all about them . It &apos;s all for them .
It &apos;s not going to be what he thinks is , &quot; Well , <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; All my <unk> <unk> are away . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> right in front of home . &quot;
And it <unk> two weeks <unk> from the idea that &apos;s <unk> -- every day -- the possibility of <unk> where they want .
The <unk> <unk> the <unk> for what we have , even when we choice was <unk> .
And the more of the <unk> that we have <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It &apos;s about how to live the moment , and maybe it &apos;s going to live on .
But the most important thing is that you &apos;re <unk> , you &apos;re not going to be doing other .
The things that we don &apos;t know many <unk> that they can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk> .
It &apos;s almost always <unk> .
And once the <unk> were of only like , and they were <unk> , and they were <unk> , only after <unk> a <unk> and <unk> a lot of times , you &apos;ll get to do good .
So , I started to <unk> a couple of new when they went , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . &quot;
And the <unk> said , &quot; <unk> wants to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
<unk> wants to <unk> with <unk> or with <unk> ? &quot; <unk> &quot; or &quot;
&quot; <unk> wants to <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> wants to <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- &quot; <unk> to <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after I was a little bit of a <unk> , I was able to say , &quot; I want to the kind of -- which was the only kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> , then I &apos;d <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk> , then I was <unk> to <unk> , and then I was going to <unk> <unk> that I &apos;ve ever had .
It was the <unk> . With that choice I had to do the best .
But I &apos;ll get worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that I was worse , with all that choice was <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I was <unk> <unk> . I didn &apos;t <unk> to <unk> me when I just had a guy , but when I was <unk> 100 different , I was at least 100 different , at least one .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
And after I was <unk> to what I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in life of people don &apos;t do that <unk> the <unk> that these have <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> .
And this is <unk> <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of <unk> , you know .
Because if I <unk> , I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth to this is more to this .
&quot; He was better when he was worse was worse , &quot; The reason he was worse , he was when he was worse was <unk> possible to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are at the <unk> .
You &apos;ve never <unk> <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you &apos;re here is , is , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; Yes , you want to . &quot;
I mean -- small <unk> moment -- that I &apos;m really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn &apos;t do , I &apos;m not <unk> .
But <unk> is not always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> a couple of <unk> <unk> when there is only that kind of <unk> is that when you &apos;re not <unk> , and I &apos;ll tell you , &quot; Why ? &quot;
Who is <unk> ? &quot; <unk> , the answer is <unk> .
The world is <unk> . What can I do ?
When there are hundreds of <unk> , and you &apos;ll get one <unk> , and you &apos;ll tell you who &apos;s the <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> <unk> that the <unk> you are .
You could have to do better .
With hundreds of <unk> <unk> , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even if the result is <unk> , they <unk> and they <unk> their own .
In the last years , the <unk> is <unk> in the world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but -- of this <unk> of <unk> is just that people have experiences <unk> experiences because the <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation think that <unk> is their .
So the final result is that in general we &apos;re better , but we &apos;re going to have worse .
Let me show you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all get to good and it &apos;s completely <unk> . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no <unk> that some choice is better than not to <unk> at all , but it &apos;s not <unk> that much choice is better than a little bit .
There &apos;s a <unk> value , <unk> . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve <unk> from a piece that we &apos;ve <unk> the choices that the choices that we <unk> choices to our life .
Now , from the <unk> point of view -- I almost finished -- from the point of view , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What allows all of this choice in <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you &apos;re going to be <unk> , where the problem is not that they have choice .
The problem is that they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I &apos;m talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> talked about yesterday about how those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> are <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> of money .
I mean , these choices , <unk> and <unk> , not that they are simply <unk> .
I &apos;m <unk> <unk> .
They do have worse to be .
If a little bit of what we do in our <unk> society , it was <unk> in those where people have too few <unk> , not only would be their life to <unk> , but our <unk> .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income is good at all -- not only to the poor -- not just to the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we <unk> .
So , let me just end up , you can become everything you want , &quot;
<unk> , people of culture , you know , &quot; What <unk> that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s <unk> that you can &apos;t do anything in a glass <unk> . &quot;
&quot; A <unk> imagination , a <unk> vision of the world --
and I <unk> it , I <unk> it , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I realized that fish know that fish know , the <unk> knows .
Because the reality of fact is that if you <unk> in <unk> , so that , &quot; everything is possible . &quot; You can &apos;t <unk> the freedom . &quot;
If you <unk> the <unk> in a way that you can <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Everybody needs a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
