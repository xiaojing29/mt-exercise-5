<unk> year I showed these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years , has been <unk> the United States had the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m going to <unk> this <unk> of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a way , the heart <unk> of climate system .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> and <unk> of summer .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years .
<unk> are <unk> in red .
And you see , you can see , it &apos;s <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That &apos;s the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> of summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , of five years or more , it &apos;s like the blood , that &apos;s where you &apos;re <unk> from the body .
In 25 years , it &apos;s been to like this .
This is a problem because the <unk> is <unk> <unk> around the ocean <unk> , where there are huge <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , are <unk> in <unk> by the <unk> .
We &apos;re going to <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> , that amount of <unk> , that amount of <unk> could <unk> this <unk> point .
In some of the <unk> <unk> in <unk> , the <unk> is already <unk> by water .
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> last team .
<unk> : <unk> ! Al <unk> : She &apos;s OK . The question is if we <unk> it .
One is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the north .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> never <unk> like that .
This is the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how to know how to go <unk> <unk> on <unk> , here is where the sea <unk> .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
On the other hand on the planet : <unk> , the greatest <unk> of ice on the planet .
<unk> month scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of ice is in <unk> , and that the <unk> <unk> , which is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> at six feet of the <unk> , like in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of ice , you see ice <unk> , which few years ago , and a few years ago ,
<unk> percent of the world population <unk> <unk> by that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : This <unk> is the source of <unk> water <unk> this city .
It &apos;s <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same happens to the <unk> water .
In California , we &apos;re <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of 40 percent .
The <unk> are in crisis .
<unk> , as you read , are <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in the world <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> are <unk> to a normal <unk> <unk> and without <unk> .
<unk> times over the last 30 years , than the <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> .
If you look at it in the <unk> context , you can see it .
In the last five years we &apos;ve <unk> 70 million <unk> of every day , 25 million <unk> in the ocean every day .
Look at <unk> the area of the <unk> <unk> , from <unk> , to <unk> , and on both of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean .
The greater cause of global warming , together to the <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
The oil is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of two countries with more emissions , with China .
And you &apos;re going to build a lot of other <unk> .
But we &apos;re <unk> to a <unk> of direction .
These are the projects that over the last years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
And every way , there is a political <unk> in our own country .
The <unk> of <unk> and oil have <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I <unk> image something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen it on the <unk> .
This is the second largest flow of <unk> in America .
It &apos;s happened around <unk> .
<unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> <unk> is a <unk> and happy .
It &apos;s <unk> here in America , and grow our economy .
<unk> the <unk> is <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And so , from here , you know , from here , you know , <unk> <unk> .
The greatest society <unk> on the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
And so the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> two <unk> .
This is a <unk> , a <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : We have to see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business .
So , for this <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> the truth .
In fact , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it &apos;s <unk> -- it &apos;s also <unk> .
So not <unk> of climate change .
We can do it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you &apos;ve heard about this very <unk> .
So we &apos;re going to <unk> a <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> are a little <unk> , but this is the sound of <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> is between the main <unk> of global warming , but the <unk> technology that you see all changes .
So let &apos;s look at this : this is the <unk> technology of <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic <unk> and the national security .
<unk> : <unk> America is in crisis ; the <unk> , national security , the <unk> crisis .
The <unk> that all the <unk> : our <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and oil <unk> .
Now , there &apos;s a new one , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A <unk> to <unk> America to work , <unk> more <unk> , and to help <unk> the global <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we &apos;ll try to solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
And he &apos;s the last one .
<unk> : It &apos;s about energy <unk> in America .
One of the most <unk> ways to <unk> the <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , a new <unk> network .
<unk> <unk> 2 : <unk> <unk> <unk> for jobs <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> America . It &apos;s time to be <unk> .
And he &apos;s a <unk> <unk> : &quot; If you want to go to alone .
If you want to go far , go , go and go together . &quot;
We have to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED I made a <unk> on the <unk> .
And I &apos;m trying to <unk> to <unk> on how the machine works .
So , I &apos;m going to go . And for the ones that the other time , the <unk> is the greatest experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were in less than a <unk> of the second <unk> from the beginning of the universe -- to <unk> million times a second .
This is just <unk> .
This is the <unk> machine .
We had these <unk> <unk> into the <unk> .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> feet and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> feet .
This is a <unk> image of <unk> <unk> in construction . And so you can see the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> last year we <unk> the car for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in the <unk> room .
It &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> of particles that had done all the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles into the <unk> .
In other words , when I <unk> that the <unk> <unk> , <unk> that the <unk> machine , which is a great <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if that was that <unk> to do this , when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the <unk> page was this .
So that means we had a <unk> impact over to be scientific .
And so , in a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to be these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works in the <unk> of <unk> .
Now , the <unk> of you <unk> the <unk> and <unk> , &quot; It &apos;s not true . I &apos;m <unk> too <unk> . &quot;
And they can do that because when they &apos;re very <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , at least they &apos;re <unk> degrees , to <unk> temperature to that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a electric <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> about 30 <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
Now they &apos;re now <unk> everybody to their <unk> .
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> is going to be new <unk> .
We <unk> it , and we &apos;ll get it to <unk> or <unk> , and to continue so our <unk> to discover what are the <unk> that <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering <unk> . It &apos;s easy to <unk> .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact , the fact that I think is the value of things like <unk> .
I &apos;d like to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> with his <unk> , his <unk> <unk> , his <unk> <unk> <unk> , he said , &quot; No is that <unk> to human mind as the <unk> of human mind as the <unk> that ideas are <unk> , that we don &apos;t have to <unk> <unk> in nature , and that our <unk> are <unk> , and not new <unk> .
Thank you .
I want to <unk> <unk> to when , as children , <unk> with <unk> .
<unk> like <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , actually <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way most of the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with objects , together to my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> , I started to <unk> , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having the <unk> <unk> of <unk> as digital <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> on a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with both <unk> and information with both hands ,
and we &apos;re going to <unk> our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that I was <unk> to explore the answer , building the answer , and we had the <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , can <unk> them , and they have a screen and they have a screen and they have a <unk> and they have a screen and they <unk> .
But <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> .
The <unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> the digital information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement of the other , and as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement , <unk> of their movement , and how we <unk> them , we can explore new <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ll start with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show up the video . If you put it in a direction , the <unk> video , so if you were <unk> on the other side .
These <unk> are <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , they &apos;re <unk> to what they &apos;re going around .
If they &apos;re <unk> , they can <unk> and they can <unk> a little bit .
If they &apos;re <unk> , they can <unk> and they can <unk> a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We then realized that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was the <unk> of data , for example , which is a color <unk> like if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> them to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> in that central .
and I can <unk> them to <unk> color in that central to the <unk> , where they <unk> .
And we can <unk> them a little bit of a <unk> .
There are also <unk> possibilities of <unk> , like <unk> , <unk> and games where people can try things , and <unk> <unk> where people can try and <unk> things , and <unk> the results immediately .
I &apos;m --
This is a <unk> <unk> that I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a game of words that &apos;s in half between <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> a letter to <unk> a letter to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> every <unk> <unk> a letter to <unk> , and while he <unk> <unk> on a <unk> .
And then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try to do it .
Thank you .
There are <unk> kids in <unk> to the <unk> <unk> , I did <unk> them and I <unk> them and <unk> a video .
They &apos;re very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things about this <unk> is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just say , &quot; <unk> of the words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
Here &apos;s other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , right there .
In fact , he wanted to just <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
We had to build a <unk> <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> . He &apos;s <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So , it &apos;s <unk> out .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now he brought a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! Yeah ! Yeah ! <unk> !
So , we <unk> <unk> and <unk> can make the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
-- let &apos;s <unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with the final story , and it can decide how to do it .
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with the final story , and it can decide how to do it .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time to show you is a <unk> , that was <unk> , to <unk> and <unk> music .
It &apos;s a <unk> , that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , to <unk> music .
The <unk> here are <unk> by <unk> like base , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of these have four different <unk> , and you can choose what to use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
And we just wanted to <unk> a sound <unk> and a <unk> sequence .
These are effects that you can control from alive , like the <unk> and <unk> .
We <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are the <unk> effects as time and <unk> , and <unk> , and it <unk> to the whole sequence .
<unk> how it works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> in two <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> ,
Now , we &apos;re going to take a <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : Now , <unk> <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> : And now I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> , so I can control the <unk> effect in alive .
<unk> : I can <unk> the entire sequence of time on one side or the other .
<unk> : <unk> : And now we &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> to give more <unk> .
<unk> : I can <unk> the &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> . &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> , <unk> <unk> or more <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the entire <unk> on the left the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain works and body .
And today , I &apos;ve been <unk> to show you one of the results of this <unk> , and also some possibilities we &apos;re trying to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to <unk> is that it &apos;s <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> with media <unk> , which <unk> in our world in the way we want to do .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time to talk to you .
I &apos;m a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It &apos;s also love love and my <unk> .
And I don &apos;t look like this can change .
But , I said this , something particular happened in my life and in my career , that he brought me to <unk> the whole relationship to this work with this work .
The particular thing is I <unk> wrote this book , this <unk> called &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which , <unk> , &quot; which , <unk> , &quot; which , <unk> <unk> , &quot; for some reason in the world and <unk> a big <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that <unk> everywhere we are <unk> now , people like I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I &apos;m going to <unk> all now and say , &quot; <unk> &apos;t you &apos;re afraid to be able to do better ?
You &apos;re not afraid to go to write all life without being able to create a book that can <unk> people ? &quot;
So , can you get to somebody ? &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , except I remember that over 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to talk to the same <unk> <unk> from fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you <unk> not to be able to have success ?
<unk> you have no fear <unk> <unk> you ?
You &apos;re not afraid to do this <unk> for the whole life without any life <unk> out and die on a <unk> of <unk> dreams with the mouth of <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yeah , I &apos;m afraid of all of those things .
I &apos;ve always had fear .
And I also <unk> of many other things that people can &apos;t <unk> .
As the <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as I was , I was <unk> to write what I thought and <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It &apos;s <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel to do .
But what &apos;s so particular about the <unk> <unk> <unk> about health <unk> in a way that other <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not ?
How do my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I don &apos;t remember one time in his <unk> years of activity in his <unk> , in fact , if he was afraid to be <unk> ?
It never -- that <unk> of the <unk> John , as it goes ?
Don &apos;t you like that , <unk> ?
<unk> , the <unk> are <unk> as a group of not have , in the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we &apos;ve got enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> but <unk> of all kinds of , we have this <unk> <unk> to be <unk> <unk> .
And so , not someone else you look at the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often to their <unk> .
And the ones that don &apos;t seem to be <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before he died , in the last <unk> said , &quot; Every my book <unk> me a little bit more <unk> than a <unk> <unk> about his life .
But we didn &apos;t know when we say that because we &apos;ve heard these things so long , we &apos;ve got <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> that creativity and <unk> , and that art , at the end , <unk> , <unk> always <unk> to the <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> to all over here today is : are you agree with this idea ?
You &apos;re OK to that -- because it &apos;s also going to be <unk> by a <unk> distance to me not OK .
I think that &apos;s <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s also <unk> and I don &apos;t want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better <unk> our <unk> <unk> to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start to <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> where I &apos;m in in my career .
<unk> -- look , I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;m quite young <unk> , I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;m quite young <unk> , I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;m quite young <unk> , I &apos;m quite young , I &apos;m not <unk> , I &apos;m a young ,
I &apos;ve got about four <unk> of work in me .
And it &apos;s very <unk> that anything you know what we &apos;re going to be <unk> by the world like the work that I <unk> after my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we &apos;re all <unk> friends in here -- it &apos;s <unk> that my greatest <unk> is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
You know , this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start <unk> at nine <unk> <unk> in the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I &apos;m going to continue doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so I think , after many <unk> , that the way to work to go on and write it &apos;s the <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to have a <unk> <unk> between me , that I &apos;m <unk> , and my natural <unk> <unk> on what this <unk> <unk> <unk> to get . And while I was going to <unk> this last year , how to look at the time , to look through time , looking through the <unk> ideas and more <unk> .
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research brought me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s because we &apos;re going to go back and then we go back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> -- people don &apos;t believe that creativity is <unk> by men , OK ?
It <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men with some <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for reasons and <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity <unk> of creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
The <unk> were the same idea , but they <unk> that kind of spirit without a <unk> .
And that &apos;s <unk> , because the <unk> didn &apos;t really understand that a <unk> was particularly <unk> .
And I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the study of an artist , a little artist like <unk> , and <unk> out of <unk> to <unk> the work of that work .
<unk> <unk> , that &apos;s the distance of the <unk> I talk -- that <unk> <unk> you from your <unk> results .
And everybody <unk> that was so <unk> , right ?
So , the <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like , for example , not ?
If your work was <unk> <unk> , you all <unk> <unk> , you all <unk> that you would have been <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it wasn &apos;t you all <unk> , right ?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
And then the <unk> <unk> and everything , and we <unk> this great idea , we put the human being in the center of the universe over all and <unk> and no longer to leave space on the <unk> .
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people started to think that creativity is completely <unk> by the <unk> .
And for the first time in history , it <unk> to <unk> to this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> , a person with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think that was a big <unk> .
I think that &apos;s going to <unk> to be like a <unk> person , like a <unk> like the source , the source of all the <unk> , <unk> and the <unk> of all the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s like to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> the <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in the <unk> .
And if that &apos;s true , and I think that &apos;s , the question becomes , the question now ?
Can we do that ?
They can go back to a <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t do it <unk> 500 years of thinking about <unk> in a talk of 18 minutes .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> on their projects .
You probably don &apos;t all <unk> to you all this .
But the question I &apos;d like to <unk> is -- why not ?
Why not we &apos;re going to <unk> this way ?
Because more sense of everything that I &apos;ve ever heard about to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process .
A process that , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so basically , all of course , you &apos;re not <unk> .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seem to completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s now 90 years , but he was a <unk> for the whole life and he said that during his <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the fields , and I <unk> it , in the fields of <unk> , and I <unk> it , in the <unk> <unk> .
He said that he was like a <unk> <unk> .
And he <unk> to her from the <unk> .
They <unk> it to get it , because it <unk> the earth under his feet .
We had one thing to do to do that point and it was to have one thing to do , &quot; <unk> as a <unk> . &quot;
And so he went to home and he was <unk> by this <unk> , and he didn &apos;t have to take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> , and he <unk> and he <unk> and he <unk> on the page .
<unk> times , I didn &apos;t want to be enough fast , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> them and <unk> them through and <unk> and she would <unk> them through the <unk> , looking for me through the <unk> , looking for me , like she said , &quot; another <unk> . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this piece of the time -- there were almost no <unk> -- right ?
So , he was <unk> at home and he was looking for paper and <unk> through , and he <unk> a <unk> just in the while he was <unk> , and he said , &quot; What was like you were <unk> with the other hand and <unk> .
It <unk> the tail and <unk> in his body and <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk> but <unk> , from the last word to the first word .
So when I <unk> <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not all my <unk> process -- I &apos;m not a <unk> !
I &apos;m a <unk> , and my way to <unk> is ; I <unk> <unk> every day and <unk> and work and <unk> and work and <unk> over <unk> .
But even I , in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I thought that &apos;s a lot of you <unk> the fact .
You know , even though the work and ideas I <unk> myself from a certain source of I could not <unk> <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it in a way to not <unk> our head , but , rather , that it <unk> us <unk> ?
And as far as I think , the best example , I have <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;ve <unk> several years ago for a <unk> .
I &apos;m talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the artist <unk> <unk> , trying to control these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then he went down , and one day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> everything .
We &apos;re going fast and everything about a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> , and it &apos;s in his head like <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and <unk> , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the <unk> , but not knows how to <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , it has not a <unk> , it has no <unk> .
So he starts to hear this <unk> <unk> species to grow up in him like , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose it and <unk> <unk> by this <unk> song .
I &apos;m not <unk> enough and I can &apos;t <unk> . &quot;
And instead of going to go to the <unk> , <unk> .
He <unk> the whole process and made something completely new .
He just just <unk> the sky and said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t you see that I &apos;m <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Do you think it can write a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you &apos;re going to get a <unk> moment when I can <unk> care about you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> <unk> more today .
I started <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And his process <unk> <unk> after this .
Not work , it was not <unk> as always <unk> .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> had been <unk> when he <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that out of him <unk> and <unk> it <unk> back to where it was , and he <unk> it back to where he was , he didn &apos;t have to be a <unk> thing and <unk> .
but I was <unk> this <unk> , <unk> <unk> a conversation with <unk> and this <unk> thing , but it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
So , as I &apos;m <unk> that story to change a little bit , even the way I &apos;m going to talk about and I &apos;m <unk> once .
This idea , I was <unk> when I was <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; and <unk> in one of those <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re all working in something and we don &apos;t and we can &apos;t , and we &apos;re not going to have the <unk> book , which will be the <unk> book .
Not only <unk> , the <unk> book .
And we started thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I &apos;m <unk> to <unk> that I was <unk> to <unk> and <unk> .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I said <unk> , &quot; <unk> , what , we both know that if this book is not going to be <unk> <unk> , not my <unk> , right ?
Because as I see I &apos;m <unk> everything I have , I &apos;m not going to do more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t , you know what , I don &apos;t do anything .
I started writing the same because it &apos;s my job .
And I &apos;d like to please that it was <unk> that I &apos;ve been <unk> to do my own part . Because -- <unk> is so , OK -- let &apos;s do in the <unk> of Africa , people <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> . And they would <unk> <unk> on for hours and so to the <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every while , I <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> .
And I know that you know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you &apos;ve all got to do , at some point , a <unk> .
It was if the time <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> through a species of <unk> and he was not doing anything different from the usually , like <unk> <unk> before , but everything <unk> .
And suddenly , not only <unk> as a human .
But it <unk> up from the <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> .
And when this <unk> , in the days , people would <unk> what was , he <unk> it with his name .
And I went to <unk> my hands and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> by &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; which you can still feel in the <unk> or in <unk> .
In <unk> , when a artist <unk> <unk> , something impossible , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it &apos;s <unk> because we need to do it .
But , the problem comes the day , for the <unk> itself , when you go and <unk> that are <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of God doesn &apos;t have more .
It &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and maybe not to <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God , while I was <unk> , and what &apos;s so he must do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so <unk> if you can &apos;t believe , <unk> , <unk> , that the most <unk> of your being being being from yourself .
But let &apos;s just show you that data in <unk> from a <unk> of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk> when you &apos;re finished .
And , you know , if we think it in this way everything changes .
And so I started <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> like I <unk> it for several months during the <unk> of the book that was <unk> soon , the <unk> , <unk> of my <unk> .
And what I have to keep <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , I don &apos;t fear .
Don &apos;t just give me your work .
<unk> to your <unk> , whatever it is .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , you &apos;re going to <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for one moment through your <unk> , then you &apos;re going to <unk> . &quot;
<unk> , you do the same <unk> .
And &quot; <unk> ! &quot; to you <unk> this .
I think and I think that &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; to yourself , &quot; I just for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know , I &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can <unk> and <unk> of new genes .
We &apos;re now <unk> a new <unk> : we &apos;re beginning to <unk> biology and now start by that digital code we &apos;re <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We &apos;ve been trying to <unk> questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; is something that many <unk> I think have <unk> to understand how many different <unk> .
We tried <unk> <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> for almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> <unk> from the world of computer biology in the digital world of computers .
Now , we can <unk> the life , or to create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species of the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> a little <unk> .
We &apos;re able to <unk> a <unk> <unk> of about 500 <unk> that are here .
But when we take a look at his <unk> map , it &apos;s simple than our own .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes we can <unk> , one at a time , it &apos;s very <unk> that this can bring a cell <unk> .
So we thought the only way to <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> this <unk> <unk> to <unk> some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of the <unk> we can <unk> a <unk> ?
Can the chemistry <unk> to produce these big molecules that we &apos;ve never done before ?
And in case we can make a <unk> <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The speed we &apos;re able to <unk> the life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the code , instead , <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> .
And our most <unk> results <unk> <unk> on a <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve been <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before .
But we found that DNA <unk> is very hard .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that we have little <unk> of DNA <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> process : the more <unk> is a <unk> process .
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , <unk> <unk> of digital information <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a little <unk> that bacteria .
We designed the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of about <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part of it is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> and we <unk> it in bacteria , and we <unk> them into the bacteria , and they <unk> the <unk> particles .
<unk> particles have been <unk> by cells , they &apos;ve <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ve been talking about the <unk> <unk> industry that they &apos;ve been <unk> this model .
They &apos;ve <unk> more than you .
And I think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we could do things in big .
We had to build the entire <unk> of the <unk> .
They &apos;re more than <unk> <unk> <unk> code .
So we thought we could <unk> in the size of the <unk> of the virus , so that we can change the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> with information <unk> in a computer , they must be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> , the <unk> <unk> was <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
We found , we had 30 , 30 <unk> . If we were used that original sequence never <unk> to do it .
One of the process is design <unk> <unk> <unk> with all the other <unk> <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk> than <unk> .
<unk> elements here .
You probably read that you &apos;ve seen <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
So we &apos;re going to have a <unk> code that &apos;s <unk> <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about 20 <unk> , and there &apos;s a <unk> order of <unk> to every <unk> .
So we can use the <unk> code for writing words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did at the beginning was <unk> .
Some of them have been <unk> by the fact that it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> by just <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started <unk> <unk> of parts , <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> to them to <unk> <unk> .
So , at all we <unk> these <unk> <unk> in <unk> so that we &apos;re <unk> to create a very <unk> <unk> as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to <unk> the process .
So , this looks like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
When we started these <unk> <unk> much , more than 100 <unk> <unk> , no <unk> <unk> into the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> biology .
So we &apos;ve <unk> other <unk> .
We &apos;re going to talk about another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA <unk> .
Here &apos;s an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In 12 hours , it &apos;s <unk> exactly like before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can <unk> completely .
We should live under <unk> .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and it <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
In fact , NASA <unk> showed that this happens .
This is a picture of the <unk> we built these <unk> , just using the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This picture wasn &apos;t <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> so big we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we &apos;ve done a little <unk> .
They &apos;re more than <unk> <unk> code .
It &apos;s the greatest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> by man .
It has a <unk> weight <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> <unk> 10 <unk> <unk> , just to <unk> pages to <unk> this <unk> code .
Now , how do we make it work ? How can we <unk> it ?
<unk> , <unk> is a <unk> game .
It &apos;s a little bit more <unk> when you use bacteria .
It &apos;s <unk> cells , even when it comes to <unk> cells like our : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the process of <unk> .
In <unk> , the <unk> is instead of <unk> in the cell , but we &apos;ve <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re able to do a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> cell to a <unk> cell to another and <unk> .
We had a <unk> <unk> by a <unk> species .
The two different are the different than men from the <unk> .
We &apos;ve <unk> a few <unk> <unk> in a way to <unk> to choose what you &apos;d choose to do to <unk> .
He then <unk> it with the <unk> so that we <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> went into the cell .
And we had to <unk> that we didn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to <unk> it <unk> in there .
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere , and we <unk> into a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So , who thinks in evolution as a <unk> <unk> at a time that <unk> doesn &apos;t have much <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> DNA .
The <unk> that was in the cell , didn &apos;t take one .
The <unk> <unk> we <unk> it .
It &apos;s <unk> , and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> , he <unk> it , and we <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk> .
It has become blue because of the genes we &apos;ve <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species are <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> of all in a new species , <unk> on software that we <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code that will be <unk> exactly to what we &apos;ve <unk> .
Now , this may seem <unk> <unk> , but we <unk> the software DNA we can change things in the <unk> <unk> enough .
Now , I &apos;ve already <unk> that you &apos;re not talking about <unk> -- but <unk> <unk> from three million years and a half million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> in which we &apos;re going to create new species <unk> on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion people to <unk> billion in the next 40 years .
Just to give an example : I was born in <unk> .
Now , there are three people on the planet to <unk> in <unk> ; in the <unk> , 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re going to <unk> now to find food , water and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for six billion people .
We &apos;re going to have to do this for nine billion .
We &apos;re going to have more than five billion <unk> , over 30 billion <unk> .
That means 100 million <unk> a day .
When we &apos;re trying to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process to <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
In the <unk> we &apos;re going to have to realize that we &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> .
And I think I &apos;ve been <unk> with <unk> <unk> around the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that they are the <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> <unk> industry only one <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out of the <unk> .
Our <unk> here are <unk> data from reality and our imagination .
We now have <unk> , because of these <unk> <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think of these 20 million genes of different genes or try to <unk> the <unk> to make <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology <unk> than in the last 20 years of science .
And it &apos;s just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to choose to <unk> , chemistry or chemistry or chemistry or <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we &apos;re working on to be able to <unk> and design species on computers .
Well , we don &apos;t know how to be .
We know exactly what their <unk> code .
We &apos;re <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You saw this <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We &apos;ve <unk> <unk> and third generation that we &apos;ll get enough to <unk> from the <unk> to <unk> of <unk> or different types of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of food and <unk> before , so we &apos;re working on design , and we think we can get the first <unk> <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> solar <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> we <unk> in the <unk> .
We &apos;re going to go into the deep ocean , at about <unk> feet of water .
We &apos;re <unk> by using hydrogen <unk> as hydrogen as energy .
We &apos;re trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2 , that can easily be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So we &apos;re going to think we might be able to <unk> what we might be able to <unk> what life is . We , we <unk> <unk> the whole <unk> goal of <unk> the whole <unk> .
<unk> . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can &apos;t do it from TED , where can &apos;t do it from TED , where can &apos;t do it from TED , where can &apos;t do it from TED , where can &apos;t do it from TED , where can &apos;t do it from TED , where can &apos;t do it from TED , where can &apos;t do it from TED , where can &apos;t you do it from TED , where can &apos;t you ?
We &apos;re going to have a major source of energy .
We also , working on the same <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
You saw this year with the flu , we &apos;re always <unk> a year and with a dollar in less when it comes to find the right .
I think that you can change building <unk> in <unk> .
Here &apos;s how the future might begin to look like <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , and finally cells .
We &apos;re so far from <unk> people .
Our goal is to make a way of living long to try to <unk> . Thank you very much .
First of all , I &apos;m going to show you , the <unk> <unk> , some <unk> , new technology that we took to <unk> to a <unk> <unk> to a year ago . This is <unk> .
It &apos;s a environment in which you can <unk> it is in the local level that <unk> with a huge amount of data <unk> .
We &apos;re seeing here <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a quick <unk> , <unk> <unk> images like .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much the amount of information that we see , how big it is these <unk> of data or images .
Most of them are common photographs <unk> , but this is a <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that <unk> <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on the screen . It &apos;s also very <unk> architecture .
This is a book whole , example of data not images .
This is the <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
And so we thought that it &apos;s just the text and not about images , we can do something like that , to make a really <unk> <unk> , not a picture .
It could be a little <unk> to read a little <unk> book .
I &apos;m not going to give you a <unk> .
This is a more <unk> . It &apos;s about a <unk> number of <unk> .
And every great image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And you really gives you the <unk> and the beautiful experience of <unk> the real version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> <unk> .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of The <unk> .
We created a <unk> <unk> much <unk> than what you use in the normal <unk> , and we <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see it here .
Or even models , or even the <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
We think this <unk> <unk> to <unk> and other <unk> <unk> , not to be <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And I don &apos;t want to lose time , if not to say we have <unk> <unk> to give us a <unk> .
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> over a <unk> image of NASA .
So now we &apos;re going to try to do this .
This is actually live on the Web ; you can see it .
It &apos;s a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> student of <unk> <unk> , a student of the <unk> of Washington , with the help of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s live on the Web , <unk> <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from an image to another and have this kind of experience <unk> .
But the <unk> of the images here actually has a meaning .
The <unk> <unk> of the computer <unk> <unk> , so that we <unk> the <unk> <unk> where the <unk> <unk> all <unk> to the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> . Here are <unk> . So you see some <unk> elements of a <unk> <unk> or <unk> , and these things are all <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of <unk> and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that we &apos;ve done for the first <unk> last summer to show you what &apos;s really the key to this technology , the <unk> technology behind this technology , <unk> . And it &apos;s not <unk> that much <unk> by looking at the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> and so forth .
This is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> and <unk> pictures of types of <unk> and <unk> and so on . <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> a picture that has been discovered in this model of a <unk> image .
So they &apos;re all <unk> <unk> and have been <unk> all <unk> on this way .
And it &apos;s possible to <unk> this <unk> way .
You know , I never thought to end up to work to work for <unk> .
It &apos;s very <unk> to <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think we &apos;ll see that it &apos;s a lot of different types of <unk> : from those cell phones to those <unk> <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> number , <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I can , I &apos;ll get those <unk> .
A lot of these are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
And some of the <unk> here is a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from <unk> to the physics of this environment .
The <unk> is that we can do things with social environment . This is now <unk> data from the entire <unk> memory of how the earth <unk> , from the whole <unk> <unk> of how the earth <unk> , from the <unk> point of view and <unk> all that data .
All those pictures become <unk> together , greater of the <unk> of the parts .
You have a model of the earth that you <unk> .
Think about this as the <unk> of <unk> <unk> on Earth <unk> .
It &apos;s something that you can <unk> in complexity by hand , as people <unk> it , and the <unk> <unk> to the use of the <unk> with the use of .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people .
If somebody comes the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name , my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of all these data , and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> to <unk> into that space , in that space , in that <unk> , using the pictures of anyone , and to have a social experience of <unk> and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of this is <unk> <unk> <unk> of every interesting <unk> of the land , <unk> not only by <unk> and by <unk> images and <unk> . But from <unk> .
Thank you very much .
CA : I understand that ? What &apos;s the software ? What &apos;s going to do is that at some point , in the next years , all the pictures <unk> from anybody in the entire world , <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is we &apos;re going to discover .
It &apos;s creating <unk> , if you want , in pictures .
And he &apos;s doing it on the content of images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> information that a lot of these <unk> pictures .
As you do a <unk> <unk> on the web , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the page , it &apos;s a lot of information about pictures .
Now , what happens if that picture <unk> , you get all of your pictures ?
So , the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really enormous . It &apos;s a <unk> effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it &apos;s really incredible . <unk> .
<unk> : I &apos;m going to <unk> you very much .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is the to live between the <unk> , the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of plants .
We think that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , or that in <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , and that the idea that the world in which we live in there is no sense , but it &apos;s only a model of reality ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> <unk> that our <unk> has done , well , or bad , a lot of <unk> .
And , of course , all of course , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Everybody is <unk> . Everybody <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We have to <unk> the death <unk> , so we don &apos;t get <unk> if we were <unk> and <unk> --
We all have an art .
What <unk> is the particular <unk> of the song , the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter whether they &apos;re the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> .
He was my <unk> <unk> in the <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> , the <unk> of the world .
All these <unk> <unk> us that are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And if you <unk> a second , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of the world create a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and is important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the total <unk> of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to be from the human imagination .
<unk> is the fantastic <unk> of humanity .
It &apos;s the <unk> of what we can be in and what we can be as a <unk> species .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or on the <unk> of the <unk> just because it &apos;s <unk> , or -- in the <unk> <unk> -- in the field of diversity -- and not even <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> diversity .
The <unk> of that is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just <unk> by a <unk> or a series of rules of <unk> .
One language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of the <unk> that the <unk> of every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , while we &apos;re sitting in <unk> , at least half not <unk> in the <unk> of children .
They &apos;re not <unk> to children , the <unk> , which is not going to <unk> something , which are already <unk> .
What is more <unk> than the <unk> of being <unk> by the <unk> , of the last few decades to talk about a language , not to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> was the <unk> of some of the world every two weeks , every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> with it <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of a language <unk> .
And I know somebody of you say , &quot; <unk> &apos;t that better ?
The world would not be a better place if we were all the same language ? &quot; <unk> , we &apos;re all talking about . &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> a <unk> thing that means not to talk about your language .
I &apos;d like to do a journey to do a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we &apos;re <unk> .
A lot of us <unk> that when I say &quot; different ways of <unk> &quot; I mean different ways of <unk> .
So , for example this <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s not able to <unk> the blue color from green because the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> time , which <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; : you have to <unk> a person talking about a language .
And all of that has <unk> in the <unk> past , <unk> is that in these <unk> families , and they &apos;re talking about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> nobody <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> to listen and then he &apos;s going to talk .
I had one of the most interesting <unk> that I lived , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> , five <unk> have <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
They did <unk> by the <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> had never seen anything .
They &apos;ve <unk> the earth , <unk> them up , have <unk> <unk> to a form or a <unk> and , and they didn &apos;t know anything , they <unk> that they <unk> the five with the <unk> .
But <unk> not only <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> to them .
<unk> percent of <unk> had <unk> from themselves .
We went down to eight <unk> and we found two cases of natural death and when we went to know , they <unk> that one of them was so <unk> , and then they <unk> it . And then they <unk> it . And so they had a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> for 40 <unk> and to <unk> species .
<unk> years early &apos; <unk> , I was <unk> a really interesting <unk> when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> between <unk> society and <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
And to make sense of the <unk> , I should have to understand the <unk> culture and the <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s quite a <unk> view of the world .
<unk> interesting .
If you were to <unk> the <unk> of the world , what would you <unk> me ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent is always <unk> out , thinking that Africa <unk> has no <unk> . And instead of the <unk> is not the other than the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
What makes interesting is the <unk> of life and death .
So the <unk> make the <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> to live in a <unk> way that , the <unk> becomes the <unk> .
For this <unk> <unk> to say , &quot; <unk> go to <unk> to <unk> to talk about God .
We <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> God . &quot;
And as you &apos;re <unk> , is the spirit that you have to <unk> , as you can &apos;t <unk> you ,
So you &apos;re <unk> to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> in the state of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather strong <unk> of the power of mind on the body when it was <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
And we &apos;re all <unk> with the <unk> that I &apos;ve lived the most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> civilization <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> has never been <unk> by the <unk> .
And in fact , I &apos;m <unk> from a <unk> , but their education is extraordinary <unk> .
<unk> are <unk> by <unk> <unk> by <unk> and <unk> , and they live in a world of <unk> and <unk> in a world that was <unk> and <unk> to the base of the <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> years of the <unk> <unk> of the nine years of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of the mother , now they are <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
For that time , they &apos;re <unk> to the values of their society , values that they <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> .
And in this incredible <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> <unk> out and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 , see a <unk> . And in that moment of <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , everything that they learned in <unk> <unk> , everything they learned in <unk> <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ? <unk> as I said .
It &apos;s <unk> . Now it &apos;s <unk> .
It &apos;s called <unk> <unk> <unk> and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think about the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the old story of the <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> in his <unk> or maybe <unk> and say that these <unk> are closer to Earth .
The <unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by <unk> .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> , but by the time and the <unk> , and the <unk> , have created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> . But on a <unk> <unk> <unk> : the concept that the Earth can only have to live because it &apos;s <unk> by human <unk> .
What does that mean ?
I mean that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> the mountain is a <unk> <unk> <unk> to be a different human being <unk> and <unk> relationship with the mountain or that would have a different relationship with the mountain or that would be <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
This made me a human being different from my friends , <unk> who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> that live north of the world , <unk> that live north of the world , <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> .
If we were to <unk> that these <unk> can create different , we could actually <unk> some of their <unk> <unk> . They <unk> this <unk> .
I took this <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard of the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What makes fascinating is not the potential of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , but the <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> by two elements .
On one hand , this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> <unk> a little <unk> that <unk> a little bit of the <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> with a <unk> of a <unk> of the family <unk> said <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you ever see the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> the <unk> that make a different <unk> of species , <unk> it <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . <unk> &apos;t creates a <unk> of reality .
I often talk to my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> the man who <unk> the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> to my <unk> you can &apos;t <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you &apos;re not <unk> , because if you &apos;re not <unk> to be <unk> because if you &apos;re done by a <unk> that is <unk> <unk> , you know , you can &apos;t be <unk> because they &apos;re <unk> by a <unk> that is <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s possible to <unk> <unk> only if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
Now it &apos;s the <unk> : the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> of the <unk> , the same kind of necessary to <unk> the <unk> . The question is , in a <unk> of plants , like these <unk> <unk> two <unk> <unk> don &apos;t <unk> , but that if you <unk> in this way , they create a <unk> version that &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
We use the great <unk> of evidence and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you go to the <unk> , we &apos;ll <unk> &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; <unk> <unk> us . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that our eyes <unk> in the forest , and that our eyes are <unk> in the same species .
If you <unk> it as <unk> their <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> of plants , you don &apos;t know everything ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take the <unk> <unk> in a <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> with a different <unk> .
And so , you don &apos;t get <unk> to <unk> , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , &#91; <unk> &#93; the problem is that even those of us who have to heart <unk> <unk> them , but somehow <unk> to the history of history of our real world , and it <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk> , but rather like the <unk> <unk> , but as the <unk> of mass <unk> of <unk> diversity and <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> of mass diversity and <unk> <unk> of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All the <unk> were <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> don &apos;t have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> in <unk> and <unk> like <unk> don &apos;t have <unk> to be <unk> when they put on the <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It &apos;s the power .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you look at the world , you &apos;ll see that these are not <unk> <unk> .
They are <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of their <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that has lived in the forest until a generation ago , and now you can see the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
We &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of the <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> .
If we go to the <unk> of the <unk> , where I &apos;m doing many research , you &apos;ll see the <unk> <unk> of politics .
As the <unk> , the <unk> of a <unk> , is <unk> to <unk> , but the <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> &apos;s <unk> , not only is <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in some <unk> , because of course , is <unk> <unk> .
And you can &apos;t understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you go from the beginning .
I <unk> the <unk> miles to <unk> in China through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> , I got to understand what &apos;s behind the <unk> that we &apos;re going to talk about .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> to the <unk> <unk> .
That means that it &apos;s been <unk> to the <unk> of Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that led the <unk> in <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> to <unk> at the age of two <unk> under his <unk> because he couldn &apos;t live without <unk> .
The <unk> , which has done the same , was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
One day he <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to work for seven years .
The pain of the <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> of <unk> is <unk> .
And then , all <unk> up to a choice .
<unk> to live in the world of <unk> or <unk> the world or <unk> the <unk> world of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died said he said that his greatest fear was that , in our <unk> view of the world , not only <unk> the entire <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> <unk> of thinking , but one day , we <unk> us from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it &apos;s <unk> to <unk> that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , who gave us <unk> to <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , by creating the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , and we &apos;re talking about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has <unk> 300 years old .
That <unk> story not <unk> me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we <unk> to get to the challenges that we could <unk> in the <unk> to come .
When these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all <unk> the chance of being what we are : a <unk> species , that has to <unk> that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are great moments of <unk> .
I took this picture on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The government has not been <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> to our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
The family , <unk> for his life , <unk> <unk> all the <unk> , and all of his <unk> .
You have to know that <unk> don &apos;t <unk> the cold , you know .
The <unk> of the <unk> were made of fish <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn &apos;t <unk> from night or <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> away , it &apos;s <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did <unk> , he <unk> them and <unk> them and creating a <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> <unk> and when <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> created a <unk> , he <unk> another dog and he &apos;s <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to talk about <unk> ? &#91; <unk> &#93; And this , in different ways , &#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> the government <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> of an area of <unk> bigger <unk> California and <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s their new <unk> . It &apos;s called <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> all the <unk> resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , to end , I think , I think , at least , at least , to the <unk> areas of the planet , <unk> that &apos;s not <unk> at all .
For somebody is home .
We had to <unk> of the human imagination that we <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> . And for us all , the dreams of these kids , become part of the <unk> <unk> of hope .
And finally , we &apos;re <unk> <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> --
&#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; but &#93; we don &apos;t think stories can change the world , maybe we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our site <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in the <unk> to bring our public <unk> in places to <unk> <unk> by which <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> world of <unk> in <unk> , and we have to find a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> world and we have to find a <unk> world and <unk> .
where the <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope <unk> other than you &apos;ve heard and <unk> them to <unk> some <unk> , in case you don &apos;t know .
I &apos;d like to start with what I call the &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
<unk> <unk> to what ?
The <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens . &quot; The way to do it is to <unk> freedom . &quot;
The reason is , on one hand , in fact that freedom is <unk> , <unk> for humans .
And so , there &apos;s the fact that if we &apos;re <unk> , every one of us can act to do everything that we <unk> our <unk> , without any <unk> that we &apos;re going to <unk> in our <unk> .
The way to <unk> the freedom is <unk> the choice .
More choices , are more <unk> , and more <unk> , is their <unk> , greater their <unk> .
This , <unk> , is so <unk> <unk> in society that no one <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
And it &apos;s also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m going to have a simple note on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> <unk> <unk> and 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy to make a huge amount of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> that nobody <unk> in your <unk> .
This is what the <unk> .
And then you go to the <unk> store a <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there &apos;s a big number of <unk> <unk> .
We can make six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are only one store .
<unk> that there &apos;s <unk> choice .
<unk> fields : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the <unk> services , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , you don &apos;t <unk> it .
A <unk> of that , the <unk> never <unk> .
These days have gone .
We now have a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , especially between cell phones .
Here &apos;s cell phones .
My <unk> is the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
If you haven &apos;t seen that in the store , you &apos;re very soon going to be <unk> .
And what happens is that people <unk> <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> this question . And you know what the answer is ? The answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than the <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : It &apos;s not going on in the United States that you &apos;re <unk> from the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> you have to do .
Instead , <unk> by the <unk> , and the <unk> says , &quot; OK , we can do A , or <unk> , &quot; A <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> these <unk> and these <unk> and these <unk> . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You were like , &quot; <unk> , what would you do ? &quot;
And the <unk> says , &quot; He has these <unk> and these <unk> , and <unk> <unk> these <unk> and these <unk> <unk> . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; <unk> if you were me , what would you say ? &quot;
And the <unk> , &quot; I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call it &quot; <unk> of the <unk> , &quot; <unk> that makes it look beautiful .
But in fact , it &apos;s not that a <unk> weight and the <unk> of making decisions by somebody who knows something , <unk> the <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and so not in the <unk> <unk> to make , which is the patient .
There &apos;s a huge <unk> of products , <unk> to people like me and you , that if you think about it not that sense , because you can &apos;t think of it .
But if we can &apos;t <unk> , why would we <unk> them ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> <unk> the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
So , let &apos;s talk about how we &apos;re now going to be a question of choice , as you see in this <unk> . &quot; We don &apos;t want to <unk> kids to sex . &quot; We don &apos;t want to <unk> . &quot; We have to <unk> it .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
That means that every <unk> , at the <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
We &apos;re going to go to the family and to the <unk> , almost to anybody , was that you would have to get the <unk> soon , and you &apos;re going to get kids to the <unk> .
The only real <unk> <unk> was with who , not when , and what to do after .
<unk> , everything is really to play .
We &apos;re going to <unk> students very smart , and they <unk> them 20 percent <unk> .
And they &apos;re not because they &apos;re <unk> , not because they &apos;re <unk> .
But why I &apos;m <unk> , I &apos;m <unk> to <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> or not ? <unk> to do that ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> later ? <unk> I have to think before kids or career ? &quot;
I &apos;m <unk> <unk> .
And they &apos;re trying to answer these questions , even though this <unk> doesn &apos;t <unk> the <unk> <unk> that <unk> and not get a <unk> <unk> to my <unk> .
And they really have to do that . I &apos;m important questions .
Now , the job : we &apos;re <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because the technology <unk> us to work every minute , from every day on the planet , <unk> that the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> , and I don &apos;t say any one , where the <unk> works .
I don &apos;t say that because I want to use it .
What does that mean , this incredible <unk> of choice , is that we have to decide , <unk> at any time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son to <unk> , with the cell phone in a <unk> , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> on the <unk> .
And even though they &apos;re all <unk> , every minute that we see our <unk> son , <unk> the <unk> , we &apos;re also <unk> , &quot; I &apos;ve got to answer this ? &quot;
&quot; I have to answer this <unk> ? I have to <unk> this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , this makes the experience of your <unk> , very different child than what would be in other conditions .
So , any of any way we look , little things and big , objects and <unk> life , life is a question of choices .
And once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but not everything was about choice .
The world today is going to be <unk> to this : The <unk> is , or <unk> ?
The answer is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> we all know , so I &apos;ll talk about the <unk> .
We &apos;re going to have this <unk> two <unk> people .
The first , <unk> , is that it <unk> instead of <unk> .
With a lot of <unk> between you , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I &apos;ll give you an example of <unk> : a study of <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> different <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What she discovered is that for the 10 to solutions that are <unk> <unk> in more , the <unk> <unk> of two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s 10 percent <unk> in less than they are available to five . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> between them , is <unk> <unk> to decide , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And in <unk> , and yet <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course <unk> never comes from .
<unk> that doesn &apos;t just mean that these <unk> are <unk> <unk> for <unk> because they don &apos;t have enough money , it &apos;s so <unk> that you can see the decision is so <unk> that you also <unk> the <unk> <unk> of work .
They &apos;re not going to be <unk> until five <unk> <unk> per year from the <unk> of work , which would be well <unk> to <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices .
And I think we &apos;re going to <unk> the world like this .
&quot; And to end up , to the <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
You can just make the right decision , if it &apos;s for the <unk> , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and you <unk> the wrong <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even though we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice , at the end is less <unk> by the result of how we <unk> with less <unk> .
And that for different reasons .
One of them is that with so many <unk> between the <unk> , if you <unk> one and it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could make a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of choice , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by the decision , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> by the decision ,
even when it was a decision .
More choices there are , easier to <unk> than any <unk> that is <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> , there &apos;s what <unk> call <unk> .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well known as the value that we give things to <unk> .
You know , when there are many <unk> possible , it &apos;s easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and be <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m not in New York City .
But that &apos;s what you probably <unk> .
There &apos;s this <unk> to the <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It &apos;s all for them .
I didn &apos;t know anything . But what he thinks , &quot; Well , <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; All my <unk> <unk> are <unk> . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> right in front of home . &quot;
And it goes two weeks , we &apos;re <unk> -- every day , the possibility of <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> the <unk> for what we have , even when we <unk> it was <unk> .
And the <unk> are the <unk> we &apos;ve got to <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It &apos;s about living the moment , and maybe it &apos;s going to live .
But the most important point is that anything you <unk> , you &apos;re not going to <unk> .
The things that don &apos;t have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new <unk> .
It &apos;s almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were just one guy , and <unk> them from <unk> , and they were <unk> , only after <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of times , you could go well .
So , I went to <unk> a couple of <unk> when the <unk> were gone , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> said , &quot; <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
<unk> them wants to <unk> or with <unk> ? &quot; <unk> &quot; or &quot; <unk> &quot; or &quot; <unk> &quot; ?
&quot; <unk> wants to <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> them <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> -- &quot; <unk> to <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a while I was able to say , &quot; I want the guy that was the only kind of , &quot; I didn &apos;t have any idea what it was , so for a time , I was <unk> <unk> , and then I was <unk> <unk> , and then I was <unk> <unk> , and then I had to <unk> it .
It was the <unk> . With all that choice I had <unk> the best .
But I &apos;m <unk> worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that with all of that choice , my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn &apos;t <unk> anything <unk> when I was just one guy , but when I was 100 different , <unk> , at least one guy had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After I had <unk> to what I was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in life of people don &apos;t <unk> the <unk> that have these <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> .
And this is <unk> <unk> , even when results are good .
<unk> in the world , if it &apos;s <unk> .
Because if I <unk> it , I &apos;m not going to talk about what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth is more about this .
&quot; You were better when he was worse , &quot; The reason he was better when he was worse was <unk> possible .
In the world , we live in -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> we can <unk> is that things to <unk> <unk> .
You never <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> are <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; Yes , you want to do it . &quot;
I mean -- small <unk> moment -- that I &apos;m really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn &apos;t do better , I didn &apos;t have <unk> .
But I don &apos;t always know it &apos;s a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> of a couple of <unk> <unk> when there is only that kind of <unk> is that when you &apos;re not <unk> , and you &apos;re <unk> , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is <unk> ? &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot;
The world is <unk> . What could I do with it ?
When there are hundreds of types of <unk> , and you get a <unk> , and you &apos;ll see who &apos;s the <unk> , is <unk> <unk> that the <unk> you are .
We could have to do better .
With hundreds of <unk> <unk> , there are no <unk> for the <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even though the result , they get <unk> and they give them their own .
over the last years , the <unk> is <unk> in the world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only important , but -- I &apos;m just -- I &apos;m <unk> to <unk> is that people have experiences because the <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation think that <unk> is their .
So the final result is that in general we &apos;re better , but we &apos;re going to take a little bit worse .
Let me just give you a <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and is completely <unk> . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no <unk> that some of choice is better than at all , but by this is not going to be a lot of choice .
There &apos;s a <unk> value , <unk> . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ve <unk> from a piece of the level of which choices <unk> our life .
Now , from the <unk> point of view -- I almost finished -- from the point of view , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What <unk> this <unk> in the <unk> society is the <unk> <unk> .
There are many places in the world , and you &apos;re <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that they have choice .
The problem is that they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I &apos;m talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> has talked about yesterday about how those <unk> and <unk> to <unk> are <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> of money .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , not that they are just <unk> .
I &apos;m <unk> <unk> .
They make us worse .
If a little bit of what in our society <unk> , <unk> , it would be <unk> to those where people have too few possibilities , not only their life to <unk> but also .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of the income is good at all -- not only to the poor -- not only because of this choice in <unk> that <unk> us .
So to <unk> , &quot; <unk> , you can become everything you want to --
<unk> , people in culture , I said , &quot; What are you going to do that fish ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s <unk> that you can &apos;t get anything in a glass <unk> . &quot;
&quot; A <unk> imagination , a <unk> vision of the world --
and I <unk> it like this , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , I realized that fish knows that fish knows the long knows that fish knows the long knows .
Because the reality of the fact of the fact of the <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk> , so that &quot; everything is possible . &quot; <unk> the <unk> . &quot;
If you <unk> the <unk> <unk> so that it &apos;s all possible to <unk> the <unk> .
We <unk> the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
They all need a <unk> .
This is almost certainly <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for the <unk> .
Thank you very much .
