<unk> year , I showed these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years , <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years , it &apos;s <unk> .
I &apos;ll take this <unk> <unk> of the problem because it doesn &apos;t show the ice <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a sense , the heart <unk> <unk> system .
They <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You see , you can see , you <unk> to the blue <unk> .
That &apos;s the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> .
You can see that the ice <unk> <unk> , five years or more , it &apos;s like the blood , which here is <unk> from the body .
<unk> years , 25 years , so .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> around the ocean <unk> , where there are huge amount of <unk> <unk> that , <unk> are <unk> <unk> , <unk> are <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , that <unk> may be <unk> , that <unk> <unk> , <unk> this point of not <unk> .
In a few <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is already <unk> by water .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> last <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : She &apos;s good . The question is , if we <unk> it .
One is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the north .
This is a river in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> had never <unk> levels .
This is the <unk> river , in the <unk> <unk> .
If you want to know how to <unk> the sea level to <unk> <unk> on <unk> , here is where the sea <unk> .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> on the planet : <unk> , the largest <unk> of ice <unk> of the planet .
<unk> month , scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of the ice is in <unk> , and that the Western <unk> , which <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> feet of <unk> <unk> , like <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the third largest <unk> <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , <unk> , which few years ago were <unk> .
40 percent of the world &apos;s population <unk> half of <unk> water from that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : This is the source of <unk> water <unk> of this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same happens to <unk> water .
In California , <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> percent .
The <unk> <unk> are in crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they &apos;re <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in the world <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> to a normal <unk> out of normal and without <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years , <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of all <unk> .
If you look in the context , you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we &apos;ve <unk> 70 million <unk> <unk> every day of <unk> in the oceans every day .
Look at the <unk> area of the <unk> <unk> , from <unk> , to <unk> , and on both the parts of the <unk> <unk> , where there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the oceans .
The <unk> of global warming , together to <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
The oil is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions , together .
And it <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> .
But we &apos;re <unk> to a <unk> of direction .
These are the projects that are <unk> in the last years , and some <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In fact , there &apos;s a political <unk> in our country .
<unk> <unk> and oil <unk> have <unk> million dollars in the last year for <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I <unk> image to me something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
Maybe you &apos;ve seen on the <unk> .
This is the second largest flow flow in America .
It &apos;s happened around <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> â™« <unk> <unk> is a <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> here in America , and it &apos;s <unk> our economy .
<unk> the <unk> is <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> here is a lot of <unk> <unk> .
The largest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> -- not know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al <unk> : So the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a part of them , a part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> , we see changes like a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So our <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> for public and <unk> the truth in <unk> and <unk> the <unk> truth .
In fact , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it &apos;s <unk> -- it also has a good <unk> .
So , we don &apos;t <unk> to climate change .
We could do it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> -- you &apos;ve heard about a lot of you &apos;ve heard a lot of .
So I &apos;ll take a <unk> <unk> <unk> for how it &apos;s <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> are a little bit <unk> , but this is the sound of <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is between the global <unk> of global <unk> , but the <unk> technology of <unk> that you see all changes .
And let &apos;s look at this : this is the <unk> technology of <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to economic issue and the economic <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> America is in the crisis , the <unk> , national security crisis , <unk> crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and <unk> oil .
Now , but there &apos;s a new , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A <unk> for <unk> America , <unk> more <unk> , <unk> more <unk> , and help <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we <unk> to solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
Al <unk> : This is the last .
<unk> : <unk> : This is <unk> energy .
One of the most <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> new <unk> network .
<unk> <unk> two : <unk> <unk> for <unk> jobs for <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> America . It &apos;s time to be <unk> .
And he &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> says , &quot; If you want to go out , you go from alone .
If you want to go away , you go away , you go away , you go away , you go away . &quot;
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year I did a <unk> on <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to try to <unk> on how the machine works .
So , I &apos;m going to go . And for the other time , there were no , the <unk> experiment is the largest experiment .
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were <unk> less than a <unk> <unk> of the second universe -- until <unk> million times <unk> per second .
All that &apos;s just <unk> .
This is the <unk> machine .
They <unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk> .
This is what I work . It &apos;s called <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> feet and it &apos;s got <unk> feet <unk> .
This is a picture of <unk> in <unk> so you can see the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> last year , we <unk> the machine for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was because of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
It &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> of particles that had made everything around the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles in the <unk> .
In other words , when you <unk> that image the 10 <unk> , <unk> <unk> that the machine <unk> , which is a great <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if it was this to make us <unk> more or this , when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> and <unk> the page was this .
That means we &apos;ve had a <unk> impact on the scientific .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to just these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine works at the <unk> of <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you <unk> and <unk> , &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot; It &apos;s not true . &quot;
And instead they can do it because when they &apos;re very <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees , at a temperature <unk> to that the space between stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> between the <unk> <unk> in <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> about 30 <unk> .
They <unk> about 50 <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> and <unk> .
Now they &apos;re <unk> all about their <unk> place .
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> will be new <unk> .
And it <unk> , and we <unk> to get data to <unk> or <unk> , and continue so our <unk> to find out what the universe <unk> to find out what the universe is .
Now , of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering and engineering of <unk> . It &apos;s easy to <unk> .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that it &apos;s so hard , I think it &apos;s the value of things like <unk> .
I want to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> experiments , <unk> experiments of <unk> experiments , he said , &quot; No , it &apos;s not <unk> for the progress of human mind , how the <unk> that ideas of science are <unk> , which are not <unk> in nature , which our <unk> and <unk> . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to <unk> when , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> as we were <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , actually , to think and <unk> problems and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way most of the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I started <unk> , &quot; And if we use a computer , instead of having the <unk> <unk> <unk> as digital <unk> <unk> as a digital <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
and we &apos;re going to <unk> ?
And the question was so interesting that I could <unk> the answer , building the answer , building the <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer like a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer like a <unk> .
You can <unk> with your hand , they can <unk> them , and they &apos;re <unk> , and they have a screen and they have a <unk> and <unk> .
But <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> is the example of a new <unk> of tools for <unk> information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement , <unk> of the movement , of the other , and as they become <unk> , <unk> of the movement , the other , of how we can explore and <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ll start with a few simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you about the video -- if you <unk> it into a <unk> , the <unk> video <unk> so , if we were <unk> on the other side .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of other .
If you <unk> them , they &apos;re <unk> to what they &apos;re doing .
If they &apos;re <unk> , and they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
If they &apos;re <unk> , and they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We realized that one of the interesting <unk> of the interesting <unk> was that we could use common on data , for example , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> &quot; a color &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot;
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> for <unk> of the color in the central <unk> , where they <unk> .
and I can <unk> for <unk> of the color in the central <unk> , where you &apos;re <unk> .
If you <unk> too , we can <unk> a little bit .
There are also <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> , like the <unk> , the math and games are going to be <unk> , and they <unk> the results immediately .
I &apos;m --
This is a <unk> sequence I do with a <unk> <unk> program .
Here we have a game of words that is <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> <unk> a letter to every <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , at every <unk> <unk> <unk> a letter to every <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And then , after about 30 seconds , and you &apos;ve got a new <unk> of <unk> and new <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the children <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , I did so that I <unk> them and <unk> them and <unk> a video .
They &apos;re very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things that this is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just say , &quot; <unk> &quot; and they know exactly what they do .
Here &apos;s other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , there on the right .
In fact , it was just <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
I could build a <unk> <unk> <unk> . He &apos;s <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So , it &apos;s doing the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now , he took a <unk> <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> !
So , <unk> <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
-- <unk> their story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide how they <unk> .
<unk> : It &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide how they <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I &apos;ve been <unk> to show you is a <unk> , <unk> , to <unk> and <unk> music .
It &apos;s a <unk> , <unk> recently , to <unk> and <unk> music .
The <unk> here is <unk> <unk> as base , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of these has four different <unk> , and you can choose .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of <unk> to your <unk> .
And I just wanted to do a &quot; sound &quot; and a sequence &quot; sequence . &quot;
These are actually , these are actually , like the <unk> and the <unk> .
I &apos;ll start to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are the effects of <unk> as time and <unk> , which <unk> the whole sequence .
<unk> like it works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> a base in two <unk> <unk> &quot; sequence , &quot; <unk> <unk> in a series , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , other base .
Now , I &apos;ll take a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> : And now I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> , so I can control the effect of alive .
<unk> : <unk> , I can <unk> the entire sequence <unk> time from one side or another .
<unk> : <unk> : And now I &apos;m going to <unk> the bottom to give <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , I can <unk> the sequence &quot; <unk> &quot;
So I don &apos;t have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the entire <unk> on the left the left <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain work and body .
And today , I &apos;ve had time to show you one of the results of this path , and some of the <unk> that we &apos;re looking for from the lab .
The concept that I want to <unk> is that this new generation of <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> information in our world in the way we want to do .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t see the time of talk to you .
I &apos;m a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it &apos;s more than this , of course .
It &apos;s also love and love of my life .
And it doesn &apos;t look like that .
But , said , this particular thing is <unk> <unk> in my life and in my career , which has brought me to <unk> the entire relationship with this job .
The particular thing is I <unk> wrote this book , this <unk> called &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that it &apos;s <unk> everywhere , people <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I &apos;m going to be now , and they say , &quot; You don &apos;t want to be able to do better ?
You don &apos;t fear on the <unk> for the whole life without being able to create a book that can <unk> to someone ? &quot;
What can you do ? &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> , you know .
But it may go worse , and I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I was <unk> to say to people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
I was going to go to the same <unk> from fear .
And people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you know , &quot; Don &apos;t you know , you don &apos;t know ?
You don &apos;t fear the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ?
You &apos;ve never fear of <unk> for all life without any life that nothing has ever come out and <unk> and die on a <unk> of dreams with the <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
So you know , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yeah , I &apos;m afraid of all of those things .
I always <unk> .
And I also fear of many other things that people can &apos;t <unk> .
As the <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as I &apos;m going to write what I thought and <unk> <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It &apos;s <unk> that anyone who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you could be born to do .
But what &apos;s about so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not ?
And my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> , and I didn &apos;t remember one time in his <unk> years of <unk> , and I didn &apos;t be <unk> ?
So , there was never -- that &apos;s that <unk> John , like ?
Don &apos;t you think that , <unk> ?
<unk> , the engineers <unk> like group not have , in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> but <unk> of all kinds , we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
And not even though , you know , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often for them .
And even the ones that are not <unk> seem to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before I die , in the last <unk> said , &quot; &quot; Every my book <unk> <unk> me a little bit more &quot; <unk> <unk> about the work of their life .
But it doesn &apos;t <unk> when we say that because we &apos;ve heard these things so long , we &apos;ve got <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> the <unk> are <unk> that creativity and the art , at the end , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> always <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> to all here today is : you &apos;re agree with this idea ?
You &apos;re good at this thing -- because it &apos;s going to be <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
I think it &apos;s <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s also <unk> and I don &apos;t want to be <unk> in the next century .
I think it &apos;s better <unk> our great <unk> to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to that <unk> <unk> to that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I am in my career .
<unk> -- <unk> , they &apos;re pretty young , I &apos;m about 40 years .
I still have about four <unk> of work .
And it &apos;s very <unk> that anything that <unk> <unk> in the world , as the job that <unk> after the world &apos;s been <unk> after the <unk> of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we &apos;re all <unk> friends -- is <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , what thinking !
You know , this is the kind of <unk> that <unk> a person to start <unk> <unk> to nine <unk> <unk> <unk> in the morning and I don &apos;t want to do it .
I &apos;m going to continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it looks , after many <unk> , which the way to work to be doing is that I was a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I &apos;ve got to find some way from me , which I &apos;m <unk> , and my natural <unk> about what I was going to do . And as I was going to get all last year , models for the time , trying to look through time , trying to find other society to see if we were better ideas and more <unk> .
as to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research took me to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s because they were <unk> and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don &apos;t believe that creativity is <unk> <unk> by men , OK ?
And it turns out that creativity was this <unk> <unk> and that <unk> to men from a few <unk> and <unk> , for <unk> reasons .
The <unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> were the same idea , but it <unk> that kind of spirit without a <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> , because the <unk> doesn &apos;t really <unk> that a <unk> was particularly <unk> .
And I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> literally in the <unk> of the study of a artist &apos;s <unk> , a little bit like the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> out of <unk> <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the work of that .
<unk> <unk> , that &apos;s the distance of the distance I talk -- that <unk> <unk> you from the results of your work .
And they all <unk> that was so <unk> , right ?
So the artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like that , for example , right ?
If your job was to <unk> <unk> all the <unk> , you all <unk> that <unk> state of <unk> <unk> .
If your <unk> work , it was not your <unk> , right ?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so the people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
And then the <unk> <unk> and everything , and we <unk> this great idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe above all the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
This was the <unk> principle of <unk> and people think that <unk> creativity is <unk> <unk> .
And for the first time in history , <unk> to <unk> this or that artist &apos;s like a <unk> <unk> that person with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think I &apos;ll be able to tell someone , a simple person to believe that they &apos;re like a source , the source and the <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a responsibility to give us a <unk> too much to give the human <unk> .
It &apos;s like to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely the <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s been this pressure to have been <unk> artists in <unk> 500 years .
And , if that &apos;s true , and I think that &apos;s , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do it ?
They go back to a more <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t <unk> 500 years of thinking about <unk> in a <unk> talk .
And there &apos;s probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you do that people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on their projects .
<unk> doesn &apos;t tell you all about this thing .
But the question I &apos;d like to <unk> is -- why don &apos;t ?
Why don &apos;t we <unk> this way ?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that I &apos;ve ever heard about <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A process that , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so basically , basically , everyone here -- you know , you don &apos;t <unk> <unk> .
And , in fact , it can be completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the amazing <unk> <unk> , who has now 90 years old , but that was a <unk> for all life and said that during his <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> out in the fields , and they <unk> it , inside the <unk> and <unk> , within the <unk> .
He said , he was like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> <unk> towards her <unk> .
I <unk> it to get , because he was <unk> the earth under its feet .
I decided to have one thing to do , and it was , words , &quot; <unk> as a <unk> . &quot;
And so it <unk> and it was <unk> by this <unk> , and it didn &apos;t have to be able to get a piece of paper and a <unk> <unk> enough to the <unk> , and <unk> on the page .
<unk> times , I couldn &apos;t get enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without being able to get into the house and <unk> the <unk> through the <unk> , and she would <unk> <unk> through the <unk> , looking for , looking for how she said , &quot; another <unk> . &quot;
And then there were those times -- this piece never -- there were some moments of the moments when the time was almost <unk> , OK ?
So , he was <unk> at home and he was looking for paper and he was looking at the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and he said , that was like , and then he said , that it was like , if you <unk> with the other hand and the <unk> .
I <unk> the tail and <unk> in his body and <unk> in his body and <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the page <unk> and <unk> , but the <unk> , from the last word of the first word .
So when I <unk> <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not all my <unk> process -- I &apos;m not a <unk> .
I &apos;m a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; I &apos;m <unk> at the same <unk> every day and <unk> and work on top of it .
But even my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I think it &apos;s also a lot of you <unk> the <unk> .
You know , even though , and the ideas , I &apos;ll be <unk> by a certain source I could not <unk> <unk> .
And what &apos;s this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it in a way to do not get us to <unk> the head , but rather , what do you do <unk> <unk> ?
And as I &apos;m going to , the best example , which I &apos;ve <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;ve <unk> different years ago for a <unk> .
I &apos;m talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life has been the <unk> of the artist <unk> <unk> , trying to control , <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , it <unk> , and a day while she was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> everything for him .
<unk> fast and everything , and everything is a little <unk> of <unk> , who &apos;s in his head as a <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and the <unk> , you know , it &apos;s wonderful , and the <unk> , but it doesn &apos;t know how to <unk> .
He doesn &apos;t have a <unk> of paper , it doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
So , it starts to feel this kind of old <unk> <unk> in him , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose , and I &apos;m going to get <unk> from this song .
I &apos;m not <unk> enough , and I can &apos;t <unk> . &quot;
And instead of going to go into the <unk> , they <unk> .
<unk> the entire <unk> process and made something completely new .
I just wanted the sky and said , &quot; <unk> , you don &apos;t see what I &apos;m <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Do you think it &apos;s going to write a song ? &quot;
If you really want to <unk> , you want to take care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And his <unk> process <unk> <unk> after this .
I didn &apos;t work , it was still <unk> as I always <unk> .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when I was <unk> <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> that was <unk> , which was <unk> , <unk> that was not going to be a <unk> thing .
but I <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this thing , and it <unk> , but it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
So how much that story I &apos;m going to change a little bit as I <unk> and I &apos;ve already <unk> , and I &apos;m already <unk> a time .
This idea , when I was <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; and <unk> , &quot; and I was going to be in one of those <unk> <unk> that we all when we &apos;re working on something and we can &apos;t think that it &apos;s a <unk> , which is the <unk> book .
Not only <unk> , just the <unk> book .
And I started thinking about this project .
But then I &apos;m going to <unk> that <unk> the air and <unk> .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my face to a <unk> <unk> of the room .
And I said to <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; What , what , both of this book is not going to be <unk> my , no ?
Because you see I &apos;m <unk> all I &apos;m <unk> all I have , I don &apos;t have more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
OK . But if you don &apos;t do it , you know what , you don &apos;t <unk> me .
I was writing the same because it &apos;s my job .
And I &apos;d like to please be <unk> that I &apos;m <unk> to do my own part . &quot; Because I &apos;m -- at the end is so , OK , let &apos;s go -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> music and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> hours to <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every <unk> , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these artists are actually <unk> .
And I know what I talk about , because you know , because you &apos;ve all seen , at some point , a <unk> <unk> .
It was like the time , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it was not doing anything different from the <unk> , like the <unk> <unk> before , but it &apos;s all <unk> .
And it all of a sudden , not just like a human .
But it <unk> from <unk> and <unk> under fire of <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at time , people <unk> what was , they <unk> what was , they <unk> the name of his name .
<unk> hands and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , &quot; God , &quot; God , &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
In <unk> , when an artist &apos;s done something impossible to be <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
And it &apos;s <unk> because we need .
But the problem comes the day , for the same , for the same , when you <unk> and <unk> that are the 11 of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s just a <unk> with <unk> , and perhaps not <unk> <unk> , and perhaps never <unk> <unk> to that <unk> .
And maybe no one <unk> the name of God still as <unk> , and what &apos;s going to do with the rest of his life ?
It &apos;s hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so <unk> if you could not believe , <unk> , <unk> , the most <unk> <unk> of your being being being <unk> by you .
But let me just give you data from a <unk> source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk> when you &apos;re finished .
And , you know , if we think , we think about it all changes .
And so I started to <unk> , and it &apos;s certainly like the <unk> , for several months during the <unk> of the book that <unk> soon , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And what I have to keep <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , I don &apos;t fear .
Don &apos;t <unk> . You just <unk> your job .
<unk> to <unk> your <unk> , whatever it is .
If your job is , you know , you know .
If the <unk> , you &apos;re going to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for a <unk> , for a <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
<unk> , you do the same <unk> .
And &quot; <unk> ! &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
I think you know , and I think it &apos;s <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
And as I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects on the human genome , on what it can <unk> and discovery of new <unk> .
Now we &apos;re <unk> a new way : we started <unk> biology and now starting to <unk> the biology and now from that digital code we &apos;re <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We &apos;ve always been trying to <unk> <unk> questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; is something that many <unk> I think they &apos;ve <unk> to understand how to do I think they &apos;re <unk> to <unk> .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to <unk> terms .
We &apos;re <unk> from almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome is <unk> to go from the world <unk> of the digital world of computers .
Now we <unk> : Can we <unk> life , or <unk> new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> a little bit more small .
We can be able to <unk> a <unk> of about 500 that are here .
But when we take a look at his map , it &apos;s just <unk> than our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at time , it &apos;s very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell .
So I thought the only way that the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> in a way that <unk> <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of &quot; can we <unk> a <unk> ? &quot;
Can the chemistry <unk> to produce these big molecules that we &apos;ve never been doing before ?
And , in <unk> case , we can make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The speed with which we are able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> .
Our ability to write the code , <unk> , rather <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> .
And our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve been <unk> more than 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> many <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before <unk> the first experiments .
But we found out that <unk> of DNA is very hard .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA , the <unk> of 30 to 50 <unk> and it &apos;s a <unk> process : the <unk> is <unk> , <unk> there are .
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And this was the first <unk> , <unk> from information <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a little virus that <unk> .
We designed <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA <unk> <unk> .
And the interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> and we <unk> it in the bacteria , the bacteria <unk> , the bacteria <unk> to read this <unk> <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> particles .
<unk> particles have been <unk> by cells , they &apos;re <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ve talked about recently members of the <unk> industry that they &apos;ve been <unk> this model .
They <unk> more than you .
And I think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we could do things in big .
They wanted to build the entire <unk> of <unk> .
They &apos;re more than <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we thought about <unk> in <unk> of the <unk> of the virus , so that we can change the <unk> to figure out what the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if we <unk> with information in a computer , these have to be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> the <unk> <unk> was to <unk> every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We found , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If we were <unk> that <unk> sequence never <unk> states .
One of the process is going to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> elements are <unk> .
You probably read that you have read that <unk> .
So we said , we have a <unk> code on four <unk> : In <unk> , <unk> and <unk>
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , about 20 <unk> <unk> , and there &apos;s a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk> .
So we can use the <unk> code for words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did at the beginning was <unk> .
Some of the <unk> were <unk> by the fact that it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
We designed these <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> and <unk> them .
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , we &apos;ve made these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re <unk> to create a extremely <unk> <unk> as you &apos;ll see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to <unk> the process .
So , this seems the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When I started these <unk> <unk> much , more than 100 <unk> <unk> , no longer <unk> directly to the <unk> in the <unk> .
It comes to the <unk> of the tools of <unk> biology .
So we have <unk> other <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to try to <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA <unk> to <unk> DNA .
Here &apos;s an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> is <unk> .
In 12 hours , it &apos;s <unk> exactly like this .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely <unk> .
You can live under <unk> .
They &apos;re absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and it &apos;s <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
In fact , NASA has shown that this is happening .
This is a picture of the <unk> we &apos;ve built these <unk> , just using the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> design of <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This image not been <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a time of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we &apos;ve done a little bit ago .
They &apos;re more than <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s the largest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> that <unk> by man .
It has a <unk> <unk> <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 without spaces , we &apos;ll <unk> <unk> pages to <unk> this <unk> code .
Now , how do we do it work ?
Of course , through a virus is a <unk> game .
It &apos;s a little bit more <unk> when they use bacteria .
It &apos;s more simple when it &apos;s a <unk> cells like our : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the <unk> process .
In <unk> , the <unk> <unk> is instead of <unk> in the cell , but we <unk> <unk> that we are able to do a <unk> <unk> from a cell phone .
We &apos;ve <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> .
The two different are how men are <unk> .
We &apos;ve <unk> some <unk> <unk> in a way that we could decide what to choose for this <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> into the new <unk> .
And they were <unk> <unk> that they didn &apos;t go beyond , but we tried to <unk> more in there .
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> from some <unk> , <unk> in a second thousands of <unk> to that species .
So , who thinks about evolution as a <unk> at the time you <unk> doesn &apos;t understand much of biology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell .
<unk> <unk> we <unk> the <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> , <unk> , and we <unk> with only the cell and we &apos;re <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk> .
It &apos;s become blue because of the genes we &apos;ve <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species , and it &apos;s <unk> of all in a new species , <unk> on the software that we &apos;ve <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the <unk> code exactly what we <unk> .
Now , this may be <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s software , <unk> the software software that we can change things in a way .
Now , I &apos;ve already <unk> that here is not about <unk> -- but to progress from three million years , and I &apos;ve already said that maybe we &apos;re going to create a new version of <unk> <unk> in which we &apos;re <unk> new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We &apos;re going to go from six billion people to <unk> billion people in <unk> billion in the next 40 years .
Right to give me a example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in <unk> ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We &apos;re going to be <unk> now , <unk> water , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> for six billion people .
<unk> even more <unk> to do it for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> .
That means 100 million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or whatever process is going to be a huge challenge .
In the more we have to realize that all the CO2 <unk> from these materials that <unk> into the atmosphere .
At the day today , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all over the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry just only one about <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here are <unk> data from the reality of <unk> and our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We can actually build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think of these 20 million genes or try to <unk> <unk> <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , to make <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of a small team , and <unk> biology <unk> .
And it &apos;s just a standard <unk> .
We can choose for <unk> , chemistry , chemistry , or chemistry , production , <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we &apos;re working on for being able to <unk> and design species .
Well , we don &apos;t know how to be .
We know exactly what their <unk> code .
Now we &apos;re <unk> on the <unk> <unk> generation .
You &apos;ve seen <unk> you that <unk> <unk> from <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We &apos;ve been <unk> <unk> and third generation that will be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> than the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> to <unk> the CO2 , and we think we can get this goal , and we think we can get the first <unk> of <unk> <unk> in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> months .
<unk> solar <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk> .
It &apos;s going to be in the deep ocean , about <unk> feet <unk> to the <unk> of water .
It &apos;s <unk> by using hydrogen <unk> as energy as much as much energy .
We &apos;re trying to figure out if we can <unk> CO2 , which can easily be <unk> through <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , we think that we could be able to <unk> what the basic question , &quot; which is life &quot; which is life &quot; We <unk> , we <unk> the entire <unk> industry .
<unk> . If you can &apos;t do it from TED , where can you ?
It &apos;s a main source of energy .
And also , we &apos;re working for using the same <unk> to create <unk> .
You &apos;ve seen this year with flu , we &apos;re always <unk> back a year and a dollar <unk> in less when it &apos;s about finding the <unk> .
I think you can change building <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s how the future may start looking at <unk> , now , the tree , <unk> the tree , <unk> the evolution with <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and finally <unk> cells .
We &apos;re <unk> so that we &apos;re <unk> to <unk> .
Our goal is to do so that we can live enough to try to <unk> . Thank you very much .
First of all , I &apos;m going to show you , the <unk> possible , some fundamental <unk> , the new technology that we took to <unk> <unk> to a <unk> almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
This is a environment where you can <unk> is at local level that <unk> with a huge amount of data .
Here we &apos;re seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , for a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> the images like we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these <unk> <unk> of data or <unk> .
Most common are common photographs , but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and they were <unk> in <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that <unk> <unk> <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in the screen . It &apos;s also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a book , example of data not images .
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And so it &apos;s just about <unk> and not images , we can do something like that , to actually see that it &apos;s a real <unk> <unk> .
It could be a little bit <unk> to read a book .
I &apos;m not going to tell you .
This is a <unk> example . This is a number of The <unk> .
Every big image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of read the real <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> <unk> .
We also made something with the corner of this particular number of The <unk> .
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much <unk> much <unk> than what you use in a normal <unk> , and we <unk> the content .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
I <unk> that this <unk> <unk> , and <unk> other <unk> , not <unk> <unk> .
Now , the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this not to lose time , if not to say that we have <unk> <unk> to even though , we &apos;ve been <unk> from <unk> in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. <unk> <unk> over an image of NASA .
So now I &apos;m going to try to do something else .
This is actually alive from the Web ; you can see it .
This is a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> to the very interesting computer <unk> <unk> , a student of <unk> , a student of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s alive on the web , <unk> <unk> .
You can see when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from a picture of the other and have this experience to be <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of images here has a meaning .
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> have <unk> these pictures together , so that <unk> to <unk> <unk> where the <unk> <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> . So here you see some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;ve been <unk> to show you a few other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> data , and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that we &apos;ve done for the first time , the first time , to show you what &apos;s really the key to show you what &apos;s the key to be really <unk> by looking at <unk> <unk> that we put in the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So they &apos;re all <unk> images and they were all <unk> at the <unk> level .
And it &apos;s possible to <unk> this way .
You know , I would never thought to end up working on <unk> .
It &apos;s very <unk> <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think you can see that it &apos;s a lot of different kinds of <unk> : from those cell phones to those <unk> <unk> , a number <unk> , <unk> <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I can go and look at those <unk> .
Many of these are <unk> <unk> , etc .
So , you know , you find a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from <unk> to the physics of this environment .
The <unk> point is that we can do things with the social environment . This is now <unk> data from <unk> from the entire memory of how the earth <unk> the earth , from <unk> <unk> and <unk> all those data together .
All those pictures become <unk> together , the <unk> of the parts .
You have a model of the earth that <unk> .
Think about this as the <unk> of the <unk> work on Earth .
It &apos;s something that <unk> in complexity , as people will be <unk> , and the <unk> that <unk> for the people who <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> by other people .
If somebody &apos;s the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name , my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of those data , and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> to <unk> in that space , in that <unk> , using the pictures of <unk> and <unk> .
Now , of course , a <unk> of all that are <unk> <unk> <unk> of every part of the earth , <unk> not just by <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> thank you .
Chris Anderson : I understand that ? What &apos;s your software <unk> us to do is that at some point in the next few years , all the photographs <unk> are going to be <unk> with anybody in the entire world &apos;s <unk> . <unk> are basically <unk> ?
<unk> : Yeah . What &apos;s doing is we &apos;re doing is we &apos;re going to find .
It &apos;s creating <unk> , if you want , in images .
And it &apos;s doing it in the <unk> of the <unk> .
And the thing becomes very interesting if you think about <unk> information that a lot of these <unk> <unk> .
As you do a research <unk> on the web , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the web has a lot of information about images .
Now , what &apos;s going on that picture your <unk> ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s really huge . It &apos;s a <unk> effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it &apos;s really amazing . <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> you .
One of the major <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> is the <unk> that you don &apos;t have the <unk> <unk> <unk> , between the <unk> in the wind , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> plants .
<unk> you think that <unk> <unk> <unk> still beyond the <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> still <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , and that the idea that we live in there is no <unk> , but it &apos;s just a model of , but it &apos;s just a model of , reality ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that our <unk> did , well , <unk> <unk> .
And , of course , all of course , all <unk> <unk> .
All <unk> . All <unk> . All <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We have to deal with the <unk> of death , so we don &apos;t <unk> if you could <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art .
What <unk> is the <unk> of the song , the <unk> of the song of every culture , the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn &apos;t matter that it &apos;s the <unk> of <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
He was my <unk> <unk> on a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> <unk> , the mother &apos;s <unk> , the <unk> mother &apos;s world .
All these <unk> <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And , if you <unk> a second , it &apos;s a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of <unk> of the world create a <unk> of life and <unk> <unk> that <unk> the planet and <unk> the planet , and it &apos;s important for the <unk> of the planet as <unk> .
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the total <unk> of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being from the human imagination .
<unk> is the great <unk> of humanity .
It &apos;s the <unk> of what we are and what we can be in as <unk> species .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> to <unk> and <unk> much more <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all the species has been or is on the <unk> of the <unk> that just because it &apos;s <unk> , or -- in the <unk> of diversity -- and not even <unk> <unk> -- that &apos;s <unk> .
The <unk> of all that is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just <unk> <unk> or <unk> or <unk> <unk> or a series of <unk> rules .
One language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the middle of the middle of every culture is in the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we &apos;re sitting here at <unk> , at least half not <unk> in the <unk> of the children .
They &apos;re not <unk> to children , the <unk> , the less than <unk> , which is already death .
What there is more <unk> than the <unk> of being <unk> by <unk> , of being the last to talk about a language , of course , not to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of somebody in a few weeks , every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , every two weeks of a <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And I know somebody of you say , &quot; Well , is not better ?
The world would not be a better place if you <unk> all the same language ? &quot; <unk> , then we all talk . &quot;
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> of a <unk> thing that means that you can &apos;t talk about their own language .
Today I &apos;d like to give you a trip through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we &apos;re <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say , &quot; different ways to <unk> &quot; I really want to <unk> different ways of <unk> .
So , for example , this <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> from the river of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> that it &apos;s not able to <unk> the blue color from green because the <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> of the forest , which <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a rule , <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; : you have to <unk> a different language .
All of that has <unk> in the past <unk> , <unk> is that in these <unk> families , where they &apos;re talking about six or seven <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> no one language .
They <unk> and then I went to listen to .
I was going to take one of the most interesting <unk> with what I lived , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> <unk> have <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
They did <unk> by the top photographs that they <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> <unk> had never seen anything of <unk> .
They <unk> the pictures of the earth , the <unk> to <unk> of a form or a <unk> and , not <unk> , they <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with the <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> not only <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> with them .
<unk> percent of the <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We &apos;re <unk> at eight <unk> and we found two cases of death and when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was so that he &apos;s dead , and then they <unk> the same .
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , first , I was <unk> a really interesting task when my <unk> <unk> <unk> , if my <unk> <unk> <unk> me , if I wanted to go to <unk> to <unk> <unk> between the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
To give a sense of <unk> , I should have understand the culture <unk> and that <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s pretty <unk> <unk> vision of the world .
Very interesting .
If you &apos;re going to <unk> the great <unk> of the world , what would you <unk> me ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent always <unk> out , thinking about Africa , <unk> Africa doesn &apos;t have <unk> <unk> . And instead of , yes , and the <unk> is not the other than the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes interesting is that <unk> is the <unk> of life and death .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of alive in a short time that <unk> becomes the <unk> .
So , for the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> go to <unk> to <unk> to <unk> .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . &quot;
And from the moment you &apos;re <unk> , is the spirit that <unk> you , how do you get <unk> ?
So it <unk> to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> in state of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather <unk> <unk> of the power of mind when it &apos;s <unk> in a state of <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> with the <unk> that I &apos;ve lived the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> civilization that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> has never been <unk> by <unk> .
In <unk> , I &apos;m <unk> from a <unk> , but their <unk> is <unk> .
The young <unk> are <unk> <unk> by <unk> , or four years , and they &apos;re <unk> in a world of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> of the nine months of <unk> about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of the mother , now are <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
And so , all of this time , they &apos;re <unk> to the values of their <unk> , and only their <unk> <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or for the <unk> <unk> .
And so that &apos;s <unk> <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> <unk> out and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 , and that moment of <unk> . And that moment of <unk> <unk> , everything that they &apos;ve learned in <unk> <unk> , everything that they learned in <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , everything that they learned in the <unk> theory and <unk> says .
&quot; <unk> ? <unk> as I said .
It &apos;s <unk> . Now he &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
They call the <unk> <unk> <unk> and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think about <unk> <unk> and the environment <unk> and the <unk> <unk> history , which is a <unk> <unk> in his <unk> or <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and we say that these <unk> are <unk> to the Earth .
The <unk> <unk> are not <unk> <unk> <unk> .
There &apos;s no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> , but because of the <unk> and <unk> , but because of the <unk> and <unk> , they created a <unk> of the Earth is not about <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> : the concept that the Earth can only be <unk> because it &apos;s human <unk> .
What does that mean ?
<unk> to say that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that the mountain is <unk> that <unk> its <unk> is going to be a different <unk> , and it &apos;s going to be a different <unk> , or that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
That &apos;s the <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
And that <unk> me a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If we were trying to <unk> that these <unk> can actually create different , we start to understand some of their <unk> <unk> . They <unk> this <unk> .
I took this picture to <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you &apos;ve heard about <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> .
What makes it fascinating is not the potential <unk> is not the potential of <unk> , but his <unk> . It &apos;s <unk> by two elements .
On one side , this <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> of the <unk> family said <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> .
If you &apos;ve ever <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that make a different <unk> of species , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity .
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> was <unk> , with his <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> my <unk> <unk> can &apos;t be <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you &apos;re done not <unk> to anybody who &apos;s <unk> . <unk> <unk> , but they can &apos;t be <unk> because they &apos;re <unk> by a <unk> that &apos;s <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s possible to <unk> just if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Now it &apos;s the beautiful : the <unk> that are in this <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> <unk> , the same kind of <unk> <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> <unk> , how do these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , they make these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . But that if you <unk> in this way , they create a <unk> <unk> ?
We use the great <unk> of evidence and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you <unk> to <unk> , &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> plants are talking . &quot;
What does that mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , who <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that &apos;s eyes in the same species .
If you <unk> how to <unk> their <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; rest ? &quot; I said , &quot; No . &quot;
The solution is : you take the <unk> <unk> in a night of the moon and <unk> with a different <unk> .
With this doesn &apos;t <unk> , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> .
Now , <unk> the problem is that even the ones that have to heart <unk> <unk> them , but somehow <unk> them are <unk> <unk> them , but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of history of our real world , and it &apos;s beyond .
In fact , the <unk> century , 300 years , not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or his <unk> <unk> , but rather like the <unk> was where we <unk> and we <unk> and we <unk> <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of mass <unk> . Now the problem is not change .
All the <unk> <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new <unk> for new <unk> <unk> .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It &apos;s the power .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you look at the world , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , if you look like , you know , you know , you know , you don &apos;t <unk> to <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> creatures and <unk> out of <unk> forces that go beyond their ability to <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> in the forest until a generation , and now <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , where you can see the river <unk> <unk> , which seems to be <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
I started to <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are the disease that are <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> .
If you <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the <unk> <unk> of politics .
As the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> physics of a <unk> , is <unk> to <unk> , but the <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> life , the <unk> of life of a <unk> , not only is not <unk> , but <unk> <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it &apos;s part of the development of <unk> .
And you can &apos;t understand the <unk> of the <unk> until the beginning of the beginning .
I &apos;ve <unk> miles from <unk> in the Western China through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> to <unk> , I realized what &apos;s behind the <unk> that I could talk about .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> at <unk> <unk> .
The means that it &apos;s been <unk> at the time of <unk> Chinese .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk> .
It was <unk> to <unk> at age of two <unk> under the age of two <unk> under his <unk> because he couldn &apos;t have any of them .
The <unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
One day he <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to work for seven years .
The pain of the <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> of <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> , all , all <unk> <unk> to a choice .
<unk> to live in the world of <unk> or <unk> , or do we want to <unk> the world of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he said that his greatest fear was said that , in our <unk> <unk> to this <unk> view of the world , not only <unk> the entire <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> <unk> of thinking , but day , it <unk> us from <unk> <unk> <unk> that they were <unk> us .
And it &apos;s <unk> to remember our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , who <unk> us , which <unk> us <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has been <unk> 300 years .
That <unk> story , I didn &apos;t <unk> that we have the answers to all the challenges that I could <unk> in <unk> to come .
When you get these <unk> <unk> of the world is what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s in these answers that we all <unk> the chance to be what we are : a <unk> species , which has to <unk> , which all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are big <unk> moments of <unk> . And there are big <unk> moments .
I took this picture on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> , and this man , <unk> me , he <unk> me the story of his <unk> .
The government didn &apos;t always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , and in the &apos; <unk> for <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
The family , <unk> for his life , <unk> <unk> all the <unk> , and all his <unk> .
You know , you know , <unk> <unk> not the cold , <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> were made of fish were made fish <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn &apos;t <unk> from the night or <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> away , it &apos;s <unk> the <unk> in the skin of <unk> and <unk> in their hand . When I did <unk> , he <unk> them , he <unk> them by creating a <unk> .
He &apos;s <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> created a <unk> , he &apos;s <unk> another dog , and it &apos;s <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to talk about <unk> ? <unk> . And this , in different ways , <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> <unk> the government <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> the total <unk> area of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s their new <unk> . It &apos;s called <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s all the resources <unk> .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , finally , I think it &apos;s pretty <unk> at least <unk> at least , at least , <unk> , <unk> that they &apos;re not <unk> at all .
For somebody &apos;s home .
<unk> <unk> of human imagination that <unk> at the time . And for us all , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our children , become part of the <unk> <unk> .
So finally , we &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> <unk> that <unk> never <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> --
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and perhaps we are the best <unk> to tell stories of the world . Every month our <unk> <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public places in <unk> <unk> that they <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> from how they &apos;ve seen and , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> for <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> : the world &apos;s <unk> <unk> in diversity , and we have to find a <unk> of <unk> world . And we have to find a <unk> world in a <unk> world and <unk> <unk> .
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope <unk> , and I &apos;m going to talk about some <unk> <unk> , in case , not <unk> them .
I &apos;d like to start with what I call &quot; the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> society <unk> <unk> . &quot; If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens &quot; The way to do it is <unk> freedom <unk> . &quot;
The reason is , from one side , in fact that freedom is <unk> , is <unk> , <unk> for human beings .
And so , it &apos;s what if we &apos;re <unk> , each of us can do it for just to do everything that <unk> our <unk> , without any <unk> that <unk> in the name .
The way to <unk> the freedom is <unk> the choice .
The more choices people have , more <unk> , and more <unk> is their freedom , the <unk> , the <unk> is their <unk> .
This , <unk> , it &apos;s so <unk> <unk> in society that no one <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it &apos;s also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I &apos;m going to show you some examples of what progress has made .
This is my <unk> . It &apos;s not particularly big .
I &apos;m just going to take a simple <unk> on the <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that no one of the <unk> already <unk> is <unk> .
Here &apos;s what the <unk> is .
And then you go to buy a <unk> <unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a big number of <unk> <unk> .
We can make six million <unk> and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in only one store .
<unk> <unk> that there is choice .
<unk> fields : the world of <unk> .
And when I was a kid , you could get all the <unk> services , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , not <unk> it .
A <unk> of that , in the other , was that the phone never <unk> .
These days , they went .
Now we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> , especially between <unk> .
Here &apos;s cell phones .
My <unk> is that in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
If you haven &apos;t seen the <unk> <unk> in the house , you &apos;re <unk> <unk> soon .
And what &apos;s going on is that people get into <unk> and <unk> and makes this question . And you know , it &apos;s the answer is , &quot; No . &quot;
It &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : It &apos;s not going on in the United States you will be <unk> in the United States you &apos;ve got to do .
Instead , <unk> from the <unk> , and the <unk> says , &quot; OK , we could do , or <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> and these <unk> . What do you want to do ? &quot;
You <unk> : &quot; <unk> , what do you do ? &quot;
And the <unk> says , &quot; At this <unk> , &quot; At this <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> and <unk> and these <unk> <unk> . &quot;
&quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you said , &quot; <unk> if she was me , what would you say ? &quot;
And the <unk> , &quot; But I &apos;m not her . &quot;
The result we call it &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot;
But actually , it &apos;s not that a <unk> the weight and the responsibility for somebody who knows something , <unk> the <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> , <unk> , and so it doesn &apos;t know -- and so it doesn &apos;t -- and then it &apos;s not in <unk> <unk> to take a patient .
There &apos;s a huge <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> to people like me and you , if you think of it doesn &apos;t make any sense , because you think you can &apos;t <unk> .
But if we can &apos;t <unk> , why do we <unk> them ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> , we call the <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of how fundamental is our <unk> <unk> is a question of how we <unk> is a question of how you see in this <unk> , &quot; We don &apos;t want to <unk> the children . They don &apos;t want to <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
The one that means that every <unk> , you have to decide you want to be .
<unk> to the family and <unk> , a time the common perspective , <unk> almost for anyone , was that you <unk> the <unk> soon as possible , and they were able to <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
The only one that the real choice was with who , not when , and even ,
<unk> , all it &apos;s really to play .
I &apos;m going to take a lot of students , and they &apos;re going to be 20 percent <unk> .
And they &apos;re not because they &apos;re less <unk> , not because they &apos;re less <unk> .
But why I &apos;m <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> or not ? <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> later ? I &apos;ve got to think before kids or career ? &quot;
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this <unk> doesn &apos;t <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and not get a great <unk> to my <unk> .
And they have to do that . They have to do it .
Now , the job : we &apos;re <unk> , like <unk> <unk> , because the technology <unk> us to work every day , from every day , from the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> , and I &apos;m not going to tell anybody what <unk> works .
I &apos;m not saying , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this incredible choice of choice we have about work ? It &apos;s that we have to decide , <unk> at all , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son , <unk> , with the cell phone in a <unk> , the <unk> <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> on the <unk> .
And even though they &apos;re all <unk> , every minute we see our <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re also <unk> , we &apos;re also <unk> , &quot; I &apos;ve got to answer this called &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve got to answer this <unk> ? I have to <unk> this letter ? &quot;
And even when the answer is , &quot; no , &quot; all this makes the experience the experience of your <unk> child , very different from what would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the things we look , things , and big , <unk> materials and <unk> of life , life is a question of choices .
And once the world was this : <unk> , there were some chance , but not all was a question of choice .
The world &apos;s world today is : &quot; <unk> is , &quot; It &apos;s a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? &quot;
The answer is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> we all know , so I &apos;m going to talk about the <unk> .
I &apos;ll take this choice , two effects <unk> people .
The first , <unk> , is that it <unk> instead .
With a lot of <unk> that you want to choose , it becomes very difficult to do .
I &apos;ll give you a <unk> example : a <unk> study on <unk> <unk> .
My <unk> has had access to data , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , with about a million <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What she found out is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> in more , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s 10 percent <unk> <unk> , there is 10 percent <unk> <unk> <unk> . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> <unk> between what you want to decide , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And <unk> , and still <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> <unk> , and of course , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
<unk> that doesn &apos;t mean only means that these <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don &apos;t have enough money , it &apos;s so <unk> that the decision is so <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re not <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> until five <unk> <unk> for year from <unk> <unk> , which would be <unk> to <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of having choices .
And I think that <unk> the world .
&quot; And finally , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
You know , you could take the right decision , if it &apos;s for the <unk> , right ?
You don &apos;t want to choose the wrong , and you &apos;ll get the wrong <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even though we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice , at the end of the <unk> of how we were <unk> with less <unk> in which we choose .
And that &apos;s for several reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of <unk> between what you want , if you &apos;re going to be a different choice , it &apos;s easy to imagine that it could be better . And what &apos;s going on , what &apos;s going on , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the decision , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the decision , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> decision ,
even when it was a <unk> decision .
The more choices you have , <unk> <unk> to any <unk> that &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there is what <unk> call <unk> .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well <unk> how the value we do things with <unk> from what they <unk> .
And you know , when there are a lot of <unk> , it &apos;s easy to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> to be <unk> .
Here &apos;s an example . I &apos;m <unk> with all the people who are not in New York .
But that &apos;s what it probably <unk> .
There &apos;s this <unk> to <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It &apos;s all for them .
Not anything . But what he thinks he thinks , &quot; Well , <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
&quot; All my <unk> <unk> are <unk> . &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> right in front of home . &quot;
And it &apos;s two weeks that &apos;s <unk> -- every day , the <unk> of <unk> where they want .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the <unk> are the <unk> that we have <unk> , more the <unk> <unk> <unk> us <unk> against how to <unk> .
Here &apos;s another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It &apos;s about a living time , and maybe it &apos;s going to be slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> to not <unk> .
The things that don &apos;t <unk> have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> point : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new <unk> .
It &apos;s almost always <unk> .
And once the <unk> were just a kind of , <unk> them and <unk> <unk> , they were <unk> , just after <unk> , they were <unk> , just after <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of times , <unk> to go .
So , I went to <unk> a couple of when you were <unk> , and I said , &quot; I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And the <unk> said , &quot; I want to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
I want them to <unk> or <unk> ? &quot; <unk> &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> -- &quot; <unk> to <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a little bit , I mean , &quot; I want the guy that was the only kind of , &quot; he had the only kind of , &quot; I &apos;m <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> , and then <unk> out of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with the best <unk> I had ever <unk> .
It was the <unk> . With that choice I had to <unk> the best .
But I &apos;ll be worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that with all the choice of my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
And I had <unk> <unk> . I didn &apos;t <unk> anything about <unk> when I was just a kind of , but when I was <unk> 100 , at least a great time , at least a perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
And after I was going to <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in life of people don &apos;t make the <unk> that these have <unk> <unk> <unk> that these have <unk> <unk> .
And this <unk> less <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> <unk> in the world , it makes .
Because if I <unk> , I don &apos;t understand what I &apos;m talking about .
The truth <unk> <unk> to this .
&quot; You were better when you were worse , &quot; The reason he was better when you were worse , it was worse , when you were worse , you could still be <unk> .
<unk> , in the world we live -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are at the <unk> <unk> .
You &apos;ve never <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you &apos;re here -- is , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; Yes , you want to do it . &quot;
I mean -- small <unk> moment -- that I &apos;m really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn &apos;t have to do better , I &apos;m not <unk> .
But it doesn &apos;t always <unk> is a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> , when there &apos;s only that kind of <unk> is that when you &apos;re not <unk> , and I &apos;m going to <unk> you &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Who is <unk> ? &quot; , the answer is <unk> .
The world is the <unk> . What can I do that ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of <unk> , and you &apos;ll be a <unk> , and you &apos;ll see who &apos;s the <unk> , it &apos;s clear that the <unk> you are .
You could have to do better .
With hundreds of <unk> <unk> , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people take decisions , even though the result is <unk> , they <unk> and they <unk> and they <unk> and they <unk> their own .
In the last years , the <unk> is <unk> in the world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but -- of this <unk> of <unk> is just that people have <unk> experiences because the <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation think that <unk> is they &apos;re <unk> .
So the <unk> result is that in general , we &apos;re better , <unk> , but we &apos;re worse .
I &apos;m going to tell you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and it &apos;s completely <unk> . It &apos;s not true .
There &apos;s no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than not <unk> , but it &apos;s not a lot of choice .
There &apos;s a <unk> value , <unk> . I don &apos;t know what it is .
But I &apos;m sure that we &apos;ve <unk> from a piece of the level that the choices that the <unk> choices that the choices that we <unk> our life .
Now , from the <unk> point -- I &apos;ve almost finished -- from the point of view , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What it allows all of this choice in <unk> society is the <unk> <unk> .
There are many places in the world , and you &apos;re <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice .
The problem is that they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I &apos;m talking about is a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> of money .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , it &apos;s not just that are <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
They do have worse .
If a little bit of what we do in our society <unk> <unk> <unk> in those where people are too much <unk> , it would not only be their lives to <unk> , but also our life .
This is what <unk> call <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income is good at all -- not only the poor people -- not only the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we <unk> .
So , &quot; <unk> , you can become everything you want &quot; --
<unk> , people &apos;s culture , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; What &apos;s going to happen ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s <unk> that you can &apos;t <unk> anything in a <unk> . &quot;
&quot; A <unk> imagination , a <unk> vision of the world --
and I <unk> it , and I <unk> it , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I realized that the fish know that the fish knows the long knows .
Because the reality of fact is that if you <unk> in <unk> the <unk> , so that &quot; everything is possible &quot; You can &apos;t <unk> the freedom . You <unk> the <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> <unk> so that it &apos;s <unk> to <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
Everybody needs a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
