S@@ ever@@ al years ago here at TED , P@@ eter S@@ kill@@ man intro@@ duc@@ ed a design challenge called the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge .
And the idea &apos;s pretty simple :
T@@ e@@ ams of four have to build the t@@ all@@ est fre@@ e-@@ st@@ anding structure out of 20 st@@ ic@@ ks of sp@@ ag@@ h@@ etti , one y@@ ard of t@@ ape , one y@@ ard of str@@ ing and a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
The mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low has to be on top .
And , though it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually pretty hard because it for@@ ces people to collabor@@ ate very quickly .
And so , I thought this was an interesting idea , and I incor@@ por@@ ated it into a design wor@@ k@@ sho@@ p .
And it was a huge succ@@ ess .
And since then , I &apos;ve cond@@ uc@@ ted about 70 design wor@@ k@@ sh@@ ops across the world with students and desig@@ ners and archit@@ ects , even the C@@ T@@ O@@ s of the For@@ t@@ une 50 ,
and there &apos;s something about this ex@@ erci@@ se that re@@ ve@@ als very deep less@@ ons about the nature of collabor@@ ation , and I &apos;d like to share some of them with you .
So , norm@@ ally , most people begin by ori@@ ent@@ ing themselves to the t@@ ask .
They talk about it , they figure out what it &apos;s going to look like , they j@@ ock@@ ey for power . Then they spend some time plan@@ ning , organi@@ zing ,
they sk@@ et@@ ch and they l@@ ay out sp@@ ag@@ h@@ etti .
They spend the maj@@ or@@ ity of their time as@@ sem@@ bl@@ ing the st@@ ic@@ ks into ever@@ -@@ growing struc@@ tures . And then finally , just as they &apos;re running out of time , someone takes out the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and then they g@@ ing@@ er@@ ly put it on top , and then they stand back , and -- ta@@ -@@ da ! --
they ad@@ mi@@ re their work .
But what really happens , most of the time , is that the &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; turns into an &quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ oh , &quot; because the we@@ ight of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low ca@@ uses the entire structure to buc@@ k@@ le and to coll@@ ap@@ se .
So there are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ oh &quot; mom@@ ents than others , and am@@ ong the wor@@ st are rec@@ ent grad@@ u@@ ates of business school .
They li@@ e , they che@@ at , they get distr@@ ac@@ ted and they produce really l@@ ame struc@@ tures .
And of course there are te@@ ams that have a lot more &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; struc@@ tures , and am@@ ong the best are rec@@ ent grad@@ u@@ ates of kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten .
And it &apos;s pretty amazing .
As P@@ eter tel@@ ls us , not only do they produce the t@@ all@@ est struc@@ tures , but they &apos;re the most interesting struc@@ tures of them all .
So the question you want to ask is : How come ? Why ? What is it about them ?
And P@@ eter li@@ kes to say that n@@ one of the kids spend any time trying to be C@@ E@@ O of S@@ pag@@ h@@ etti , In@@ c . Right ?
They don &apos;t spend time j@@ oc@@ ke@@ ying for power .
But there &apos;s another reason as well .
And the reason is that business students are train@@ ed to find the single right pl@@ an , right ?
And then they ex@@ ec@@ ute on it .
And then what happens is , when they put the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on the top , they run out of time and what happens ?
It &apos;s a c@@ ris@@ is .
S@@ ound famili@@ ar ? Right .
What kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten@@ ers do differ@@ ently is that they start with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and they build prot@@ ot@@ y@@ pes , successi@@ ve prot@@ ot@@ y@@ pes , always ke@@ ep@@ ing the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on top , so they have multi@@ ple times to fi@@ x when they build prot@@ ot@@ y@@ pes along the way .
D@@ es@@ ig@@ ners recogni@@ ze this type of collabor@@ ation as the ess@@ ence of the iter@@ ative process .
And with each version , kids get inst@@ ant fe@@ ed@@ back about what works and what doesn &apos;t work .
So the capac@@ ity to play in prot@@ ot@@ y@@ pe is really ess@@ ential , but let &apos;s look at how different te@@ ams per@@ form .
So the average for most people is around 20 in@@ ches ; business schools students , about half of that ; la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , a little better , but not much better than that , kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten@@ ers , better than most adul@@ ts .
W@@ ho does the very best ?
Ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ects and engine@@ ers , th@@ an@@ k@@ fully .
Th@@ ir@@ ty@@ -@@ n@@ ine in@@ ches is the t@@ all@@ est structure I &apos;ve seen .
And why is it ? Because they understand tri@@ ang@@ les and self-@@ re@@ in@@ for@@ c@@ ing ge@@ ome@@ tr@@ ical patter@@ ns are the key to building st@@ able struc@@ tures .
So C@@ E@@ O@@ s , a little bit better than average ,
but here &apos;s where it gets interesting .
If you put you put an ex@@ ec@@ uti@@ ve ad@@ min@@ . on the team , they get signific@@ antly better .
It &apos;s incredible . You know , you look around , you go , &quot; Oh , that team &apos;s going to win . &quot; You can just tell be@@ for@@ e@@ hand . And why is that ?
Because they have speci@@ al sk@@ ill@@ s of facil@@ it@@ ation .
They man@@ age the process , they understand the process .
And any team who man@@ ages and p@@ ays close attention to work will signific@@ antly im@@ prove the team &apos;s performan@@ ce .
S@@ pe@@ ci@@ ali@@ zed sk@@ ill@@ s and facil@@ it@@ ation sk@@ ill@@ s are the combin@@ ation that lead@@ s to strong succ@@ ess .
If you have 10 te@@ ams that ty@@ pic@@ ally per@@ form , you &apos;ll get maybe six or so that have st@@ anding struc@@ tures .
And I tried something interesting .
I thought , let &apos;s up the ante , once .
So I off@@ ered a 10@@ ,000 dol@@ l@@ ar pri@@ ze of software to the w@@ inning team .
So what do you think happened to these design students ?
What was the result ?
Here &apos;s what happened :
Not one team had a st@@ anding structure .
If anyone had built , say , a one in@@ ch structure , they would have taken home the pri@@ ze .
So , isn &apos;t that interesting ? That high sta@@ kes have a strong impact .
We did the ex@@ erci@@ se again with the same students .
What do you think happened then ?
So now they understand the value of prot@@ ot@@ y@@ ping .
So the same team went from being the very wor@@ st to being am@@ ong the very best .
They produc@@ ed the t@@ all@@ est struc@@ tures in the least amount of time .
So there &apos;s deep less@@ ons for us about the nature of inc@@ enti@@ ves and succ@@ ess . So , you might ask : Why would anyone actually spend time writ@@ ing a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge ?
And the reason is , I help create dig@@ ital tools and process@@ es to help te@@ ams build cars and video g@@ ames and visu@@ al eff@@ ects .
And what the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge does is it hel@@ ps them identi@@ fy the hi@@ d@@ den assum@@ p@@ tions .
Because , fr@@ an@@ k@@ ly , every project has its own mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , doesn &apos;t it ?
The challenge prov@@ ide@@ s a shar@@ ed experience , a common language , a common st@@ ance to build the right prot@@ ot@@ y@@ pe .
And so , this is the value of the experience , of this so simple ex@@ erci@@ se .
And those of you who are interested may want to go to Mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low@@ Ch@@ all@@ eng@@ e@@ .@@ com@@ .
It &apos;s a blog that you can look at how to build the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lows .
There &apos;s ste@@ p@@ -@@ b@@ y-@@ step in@@ struc@@ tions on this .
There are cra@@ z@@ y examples from around the world of how people tw@@ ea@@ k and ad@@ just the system .
There &apos;s world recor@@ ds that are on this as well .
And the fundament@@ al less@@ on , I believe , is that design tru@@ ly is a cont@@ act s@@ port .
It dem@@ ands that we bring all of our sens@@ es to the t@@ ask , and that we app@@ ly the very best of our thinking , our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand .
And sometimes , a little prot@@ ot@@ y@@ pe of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an &quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ oh &quot; moment to a &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; moment .
And that can make a big difference .
Thank you very much .
Let &apos;s pre@@ tend right here we have a machine . A big machine , a cool , TED@@ -@@ ish machine , and it &apos;s a time machine .
And everyone in this room has to get into it .
And you can go back@@ wards , you can go for@@ wards ; you cannot st@@ ay where you are .
And I won@@ der what you &apos;d cho@@ ose , because I &apos;ve been asking my friends this question a lot l@@ ately and they all want to go back .
I don &apos;t know . They want to go back before there were autom@@ o@@ bil@@ es or Tw@@ itt@@ er or &quot; American I@@ do@@ l . &quot;
I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m conv@@ inc@@ ed that there &apos;s some sort of pul@@ l to n@@ os@@ tal@@ gia , to wi@@ sh@@ ful thinking .
And I understand that .
I &apos;m not part of that cro@@ w@@ d , I have to say .
I don &apos;t want to go back , and it &apos;s not because I &apos;m ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ ous . It &apos;s because possi@@ bil@@ ities on this planet , they don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
So I want to get in the machine , and I want to go forward .
This is the gre@@ at@@ est time there &apos;s ever been on this planet by any meas@@ ure that you wish to cho@@ ose : health , we@@ al@@ th , mo@@ bility , opportunity , de@@ clin@@ ing r@@ ates of disease ...
There &apos;s never been a time like this .
My gre@@ at@@ -@@ grand@@ parents died , all of them , by the time they were 60 .
My grand@@ parents p@@ ush@@ ed that number to 70 .
My parents are clos@@ ing in on 80 .
So there better be a n@@ ine at the beginning of my death number .
But it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger deal than that .
A kid born in New D@@ el@@ hi today can exp@@ ect to live as long as the ri@@ ch@@ est man in the world did 100 years ago .
Th@@ ink about that , it &apos;s an incredible fact .
And why is it true ?
S@@ m@@ all@@ po@@ x . S@@ m@@ all@@ po@@ x kill@@ ed bil@@ lions of people on this planet .
It res@@ hap@@ ed the dem@@ ograp@@ hy of the g@@ lo@@ be in a way that no war ever has .
It &apos;s gone . It &apos;s v@@ an@@ i@@ shed .
We v@@ an@@ qui@@ shed it . Pu@@ ff .
In the r@@ ich world , dise@@ ases that thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed millions of us just a generation ago no longer ex@@ ist , har@@ d@@ ly .
Di@@ ph@@ ther@@ ia , ru@@ bella , pol@@ io ...
does anyone even know what those things are ?
V@@ acc@@ ines , moder@@ n medicine , our ability to fe@@ ed bil@@ lions of people , those are tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s of the scientific me@@ th@@ od .
And to my mind , the scientific me@@ th@@ od -- trying stuff out , seeing if it works , changing it when it doesn &apos;t -- is one of the great ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ments of human@@ ity .
So that &apos;s the good news .
Un@@ fortun@@ ately , that &apos;s all the good news because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve been men@@ tion@@ ed many times . And one of them is that des@@ p@@ ite all our ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ments , a billion people go to bed hun@@ gr@@ y in this world every day .
That number &apos;s ris@@ ing , and it &apos;s ris@@ ing really rapid@@ ly , and it &apos;s dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ eful .
And not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagin@@ ation to th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly tras@@ h this g@@ lo@@ be .
Pot@@ able water , ar@@ able land , ra@@ in@@ for@@ ests , oil , gas : they &apos;re going away , and they &apos;re going away soon , and un@@ less we innov@@ ate our way out of this m@@ ess , we &apos;re going away too .
So the question is : Can we do that ? And I think we can .
I think it &apos;s clear that we can make food that will fe@@ ed bil@@ lions of people without rap@@ ing the land that they live on .
I think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t also des@@ tro@@ y it .
I really do believe that , and , no , it ain &apos;t wi@@ sh@@ ful thinking .
But here &apos;s the thing that ke@@ ep@@ s me up at night -- one of the things that ke@@ ep@@ s me up at night :
We &apos;ve never needed progres@@ s in science more than we need it right now . N@@ ever . And we &apos;ve also never been in a pos@@ ition to de@@ plo@@ y it proper@@ ly in the way that we can today .
We &apos;re on the ver@@ ge of amazing , amazing ev@@ ents in many fiel@@ ds ,
and yet I actually think we &apos;d have to go back hundreds , 300 years , before the En@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ment , to find a time when we batt@@ led progres@@ s , when we f@@ ought about these things more vi@@ g@@ or@@ ously , on more fron@@ ts , than we do now .
People w@@ ra@@ p themselves in their beli@@ ef@@ s , and they do it so ti@@ gh@@ tly that you can &apos;t set them free .
Not even the truth will set them free .
And , list@@ en , everyone &apos;s ent@@ it@@ led to their opini@@ on ; they &apos;re even ent@@ it@@ led to their opini@@ on about progres@@ s . But you know what you &apos;re not ent@@ it@@ led to ?
You &apos;re not ent@@ it@@ led to your own fac@@ ts . S@@ or@@ ry , you &apos;re not .
And this took me a@@ while to figure out .
Ab@@ out a dec@@ ade ago , I wrote a story about vacc@@ ines for The New Yor@@ ker . A little story .
And I was amaz@@ ed to find op@@ pos@@ ition : op@@ pos@@ ition to what is , after all , the most eff@@ ective public health meas@@ ure in human history .
I didn &apos;t know what to do , so I just did what I do : I wrote a story and I moved on .
And soon after that , I wrote a story about gen@@ et@@ ically engine@@ ered food .
S@@ ame thing , only bigger .
People were going cra@@ z@@ y .
So I wrote a story about that too , and I couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; Fran@@ k@@ en@@ f@@ oo@@ ds , &quot; why they thought moving molec@@ ules around in a speci@@ fic , rather than a hap@@ h@@ az@@ ard way , was tr@@ es@@ pass@@ ing on nature &apos;s ground .
But , you know , I do what I do . I wrote the story , I moved on .
I mean , I &apos;m a jour@@ n@@ al@@ ist . We type , we fi@@ le , we go to d@@ inn@@ er . It &apos;s fine .
But these stories bo@@ ther@@ ed me , and I couldn &apos;t figure out why , and ev@@ entu@@ ally I did .
And that &apos;s because those fan@@ at@@ ics that were driv@@ ing me cra@@ z@@ y wer@@ en &apos;t actually fan@@ at@@ ics at all .
They were thou@@ gh@@ t@@ ful people , educ@@ ated people , dec@@ ent people .
They were exactly like the people in this room .
And it just dist@@ urb@@ ed me so much .
But then I thought , you know , let &apos;s be hon@@ est . We &apos;re at a point in this world where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progres@@ s that we used to .
We talk about it ambi@@ val@@ ently .
We talk about it in ir@@ on@@ ic terms with little quot@@ es around it : &quot; progres@@ s . &quot; Okay , there are reasons for that , and I think we know what those reasons are .
We &apos;ve lost fa@@ ith in institu@@ tions , in auth@@ or@@ ity , and sometimes in science itself , and there &apos;s no reason we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t have .
You can just say a few nam@@ es and people will understand .
Ch@@ er@@ no@@ b@@ y@@ l , B@@ hop@@ al , the Ch@@ all@@ eng@@ er , Vi@@ ox@@ x , we@@ ap@@ ons of mass des@@ truc@@ tion , h@@ ang@@ ing ch@@ ad@@ s .
You know , you can cho@@ ose your li@@ st .
There are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right ,
so be sk@@ ep@@ tical .
A@@ s@@ k questions , dem@@ and pro@@ of , dem@@ and evid@@ ence .
Don &apos;t take anything for gran@@ ted .
But here &apos;s the thing : When you get pro@@ of , you need to acc@@ ept the pro@@ of , and we &apos;re not that good at doing that .
And the reason that I can say that is because we &apos;re now in an epi@@ de@@ mic of fe@@ ar like one I &apos;ve never seen and hope never to see again .
Ab@@ out 12 years ago , there was a story publi@@ shed , a hor@@ ri@@ ble story , that lin@@ ked the epi@@ de@@ mic of auti@@ s@@ m to the meas@@ les , m@@ um@@ ps and ru@@ bella vacc@@ ine sho@@ t .
V@@ ery sc@@ ary .
T@@ ons of studi@@ es were done to see if this was true .
T@@ ons of studi@@ es should have been done ; it &apos;s a seri@@ ous issue .
The data came back .
The data came back from the United States , from En@@ g@@ land , from S@@ we@@ den , from C@@ an@@ ada , and it was all the same : no cor@@ rel@@ ation , no connec@@ tion , n@@ one at all .
It doesn &apos;t matter . It doesn &apos;t matter because we believe an@@ ec@@ dot@@ es , we believe what we see , what we think we see , what makes us feel real .
We don &apos;t believe a b@@ unch of docum@@ ents from a government off@@ ici@@ al giving us data , and I do understand that , I think we all do .
But you know what ?
The result of that has been dis@@ astr@@ ous .
Dis@@ astr@@ ous because here &apos;s a fact : The United States is one of the only countries in the world where the vacc@@ ine rate for meas@@ les is going down .
That is dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ eful , and we should be ash@@ am@@ ed of ourselves .
It &apos;s hor@@ ri@@ ble .
What kind of a thing happened that we could do that ?
Now , I understand it . I do understand it .
Because , did anyone have meas@@ les here ?
H@@ as one person in this audience ever seen someone die of meas@@ les ?
D@@ o@@ esn &apos;t happen very much .
D@@ o@@ esn &apos;t happen in this country at all , but it happened 1@@ 6@@ 0,000 times in the world last year .
That &apos;s a lot of death of meas@@ les -- 20 an hour .
But since it didn &apos;t happen here , we can put it out of our min@@ ds , and people like J@@ enn@@ y Mc@@ Car@@ thy can go around pre@@ ach@@ ing mess@@ ages of fe@@ ar and ill@@ iter@@ ac@@ y from pl@@ at@@ forms like &quot; O@@ pr@@ ah &quot; and &quot; L@@ ar@@ ry K@@ ing Li@@ ve . &quot;
And they can do it because they don &apos;t lin@@ k ca@@ us@@ ation and cor@@ rel@@ ation .
They don &apos;t understand that these things seem the same , but they &apos;re almost never the same .
And it &apos;s something we need to learn , and we need to learn it really soon .
This guy was a h@@ ero , J@@ on@@ as S@@ alk .
He took one of the wor@@ st sc@@ our@@ ges of man@@ kind away from us .
No fe@@ ar , no ag@@ ony . P@@ ol@@ io -- pu@@ ff , gone .
That guy in the middle , not so much .
H@@ is name is Paul O@@ ff@@ it .
He just developed a rot@@ av@@ ir@@ us vacc@@ ine with a b@@ unch of other people .
It &apos;ll save the lives of 400 to 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 kids in the developing world every year .
P@@ ret@@ ty good , right ?
Well , it &apos;s good , exc@@ ept that Paul goes around talking about vacc@@ ines and says how val@@ u@@ able they are and that people ought to just stop the wh@@ in@@ ing .
And he actually says it that way .
So , Paul &apos;s a terr@@ or@@ ist .
When Paul spe@@ a@@ ks in a public hear@@ ing , he can &apos;t tes@@ ti@@ fy without ar@@ m@@ ed guar@@ ds .
He gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school .
And why ? Because Paul made a vacc@@ ine .
I don &apos;t need to say this , but vacc@@ ines are ess@@ ential .
You take them away , disease comes back , hor@@ ri@@ ble dise@@ ases . And that &apos;s happening .
We have meas@@ les in this country now .
And it &apos;s getting wor@@ se , and pretty soon kids are going to die of it again because it &apos;s just a numbers game .
And they &apos;re not just going to die of meas@@ les .
What about pol@@ io ? Let &apos;s have that . Why not ?
A colle@@ ge class@@ m@@ ate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought I was a little str@@ id@@ ent .
No one &apos;s ever said that before .
She wasn &apos;t going to vacc@@ inate her kid against pol@@ io ,
no way .
F@@ ine .
Why ? Because we don &apos;t have pol@@ io . And you know what ?
We didn &apos;t have pol@@ io in this country y@@ ester@@ day .
To@@ day , I don &apos;t know , maybe a guy got on a plane in L@@ ag@@ os this morning , and he &apos;s fl@@ ying to L@@ A@@ X , right now he &apos;s over O@@ h@@ io .
And he &apos;s going to land in a couple of hours , he &apos;s going to r@@ ent a car , and he &apos;s going to come to L@@ ong Be@@ ach , and he &apos;s going to atten@@ d one of these fab@@ ul@@ ous TED d@@ inn@@ ers t@@ oni@@ ght .
And he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s inf@@ ected with a par@@ al@@ y@@ tic disease , and we don &apos;t either because that &apos;s the way the world works .
That &apos;s the planet we live on . Don &apos;t pre@@ tend it isn &apos;t .
Now , we love to w@@ ra@@ p ourselves in lies . We love to do it .
Every@@ one take their vit@@ am@@ ins this morning ?
E@@ ch@@ in@@ ac@@ ea , a little anti@@ ox@@ id@@ ant to get you going .
I know you did because half of Americ@@ ans do every day .
They take the stuff , and they take altern@@ ative medic@@ ines , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find out that they &apos;re us@@ eless .
The data says it all the time .
They dar@@ ken your ur@@ ine . They almost never do more than that .
It &apos;s o@@ kay , you want to pay 2@@ 8 billion dollars for dark ur@@ ine ? I &apos;m totally with you .
Dar@@ k ur@@ ine . Dar@@ k .
Why do we do that ? Why do we do that ?
Well , I think I understand , we h@@ ate Bi@@ g P@@ har@@ ma .
We h@@ ate Bi@@ g G@@ over@@ n@@ ment . We don &apos;t tr@@ ust the M@@ an .
And we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t : Our health care system su@@ c@@ ks .
It &apos;s cru@@ el to millions of people .
It &apos;s absolutely ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ ingly col@@ d and s@@ ou@@ l@@ -@@ b@@ end@@ ing to those of us who can even af@@ ford it .
So we run away from it , and where do we run ?
We le@@ a@@ p into the ar@@ ms of Bi@@ g P@@ l@@ ac@@ eb@@ o .
That &apos;s fantast@@ ic . I love Bi@@ g P@@ l@@ ac@@ eb@@ o .
But , you know , it &apos;s really a seri@@ ous thing because this stuff is cra@@ p , and we spend bil@@ lions of dollars on it .
And I have all sor@@ ts of little prop@@ s here .
N@@ one of it ... g@@ in@@ k@@ go , fr@@ au@@ d ; e@@ ch@@ in@@ ac@@ ea , fr@@ au@@ d ; ac@@ ai -- I don &apos;t even know what that is but we &apos;re spen@@ ding bil@@ lions of dollars on it -- it &apos;s fr@@ au@@ d .
And you know what ? When I say this stuff , people scre@@ am at me , and they say , &quot; What do you care ? Let people do what they want to do .
It makes them feel good . &quot;
And you know what ? You &apos;re wrong .
Because I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s the sec@@ ret@@ ary of H@@ H@@ S who &apos;s saying , &quot; H@@ m@@ m , I &apos;m not going to take the evid@@ ence of my ex@@ per@@ ts on mam@@ m@@ og@@ ram@@ s , &quot; or some cancer qu@@ ack who wants to tre@@ at his patient with co@@ ff@@ ee en@@ em@@ as .
When you start down the road where beli@@ ef and mag@@ ic re@@ place evid@@ ence and science , you end up in a place you don &apos;t want to be .
You end up in Th@@ ab@@ o M@@ be@@ k@@ i South Africa .
He kill@@ ed 4@@ 0@@ 0,000 of his people by in@@ sist@@ ing that be@@ e@@ tr@@ oot , gar@@ li@@ c and lem@@ on oil were much more eff@@ ective than the anti@@ re@@ trov@@ ir@@ al dru@@ gs we know can s@@ low the course of AIDS .
H@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of thousands of ne@@ ed@@ less de@@ a@@ ths in a country that has been pl@@ ag@@ u@@ ed wor@@ se than any other by this disease .
P@@ le@@ ase , don &apos;t tell me there are no con@@ sequ@@ ences to these things .
There are . There always are .
Now , the most min@@ d@@ less epi@@ de@@ mic we &apos;re in the middle of right now is this ab@@ sur@@ d batt@@ le between prop@@ on@@ ents of gen@@ et@@ ically engine@@ ered food and the organ@@ ic el@@ ite .
It &apos;s an idi@@ ot@@ ic deb@@ ate . It has to stop .
It &apos;s a deb@@ ate about words , about met@@ ap@@ h@@ ors .
It &apos;s ide@@ ology , it &apos;s not science .
E@@ very single thing we eat , every gr@@ ain of r@@ ice , every s@@ pri@@ g of par@@ s@@ ley , every Br@@ us@@ sel@@ s spr@@ out has been modi@@ fied by man .
You know , there wer@@ en &apos;t t@@ ang@@ er@@ ines in the gar@@ den of E@@ den .
There wasn &apos;t any can@@ tal@@ ou@@ pe .
There wer@@ en &apos;t Ch@@ rist@@ m@@ as trees . We made it all .
We made it over the last 1@@ 1@@ ,000 years .
And some of it worked , and some of it didn &apos;t .
We got ri@@ d of the stuff that didn &apos;t .
Now we can do it in a more preci@@ se way --
and there are ris@@ ks , absolutely --
but we can put something like vit@@ am@@ in A into r@@ ice , and that stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , pr@@ ol@@ ong their lives .
You don &apos;t want to do that ?
I have to say , I don &apos;t understand it .
We object to gen@@ et@@ ically engine@@ ered food .
Why do we do that ?
Well , the things I con@@ st@@ antly hear are : To@@ o many chem@@ ic@@ als , pes@@ tic@@ ide@@ s , hor@@ mon@@ es , mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ ture , we don &apos;t want gi@@ ant fiel@@ ds of the same thing , that &apos;s wrong .
We don &apos;t companies pat@@ ent@@ ing life .
We don &apos;t want companies ow@@ ning se@@ eds .
And you know what my respon@@ se to all of that is ?
Yes , you &apos;re right . Let &apos;s fi@@ x it .
It &apos;s true , we &apos;ve got a huge food problem , but this isn &apos;t science .
This has nothing to do with science .
It &apos;s law , it &apos;s mor@@ ality , it &apos;s pat@@ ent stuff .
You know science isn &apos;t a company .
It &apos;s not a country .
It &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
It &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &apos;t , but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we &apos;re afr@@ aid , is really very de@@ ad@@ ening , and it &apos;s pre@@ vent@@ ing millions of people from pros@@ per@@ ing .
You know , in the next 50 years we &apos;re going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now , 70 percent .
This invest@@ ment in Africa over the last 30 years .
Dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ eful . Dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ eful .
They need it , and we &apos;re not giving it to them .
And why ? G@@ en@@ et@@ ically engine@@ ered food .
We don &apos;t want to en@@ cour@@ age people to eat that r@@ ott@@ en stuff , like c@@ ass@@ ava for inst@@ ance .
C@@ ass@@ ava &apos;s something that half a billion people eat .
It &apos;s kind of like a pot@@ ato .
It &apos;s just a b@@ unch of cal@@ or@@ ies . It su@@ c@@ ks .
It doesn &apos;t have nu@@ tri@@ ents , it doesn &apos;t have prote@@ in , and scientists are engine@@ ering all of that into it right now .
And then people would be able to eat it and they &apos;d be able to not go bl@@ ind .
They wouldn &apos;t star@@ ve , and you know what ?
That would be nice . It wouldn &apos;t be C@@ he@@ z P@@ an@@ is@@ se , but it would be nice .
And all I can say about this is : Why are we fi@@ gh@@ ting it ?
I mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves : Why are we fi@@ gh@@ ting it ?
Because we don &apos;t want to move gen@@ es around ?
This is about moving gen@@ es around . It &apos;s not about chem@@ ic@@ als .
It &apos;s not about our ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous pas@@ sion for hor@@ mon@@ es , our in@@ sist@@ ence on having bigger food , better food , sing@@ ular food .
This isn &apos;t about R@@ ice K@@ ris@@ pi@@ es ,
this is about ke@@ ep@@ ing people ali@@ ve , and it &apos;s about time we started to understand what that me@@ ant .
Because , you know something ? If we don &apos;t , if we continu@@ e to act the way we &apos;re ac@@ ting , we &apos;re gu@@ il@@ ty of something that I don &apos;t think we want to be gu@@ il@@ ty of : high-@@ tec@@ h col@@ oni@@ al@@ ism .
There &apos;s no other way to descri@@ be what &apos;s going on here .
It &apos;s sel@@ fish , it &apos;s u@@ g@@ ly , it &apos;s ben@@ e@@ ath us , and we really have to stop it .
So after this amaz@@ ingly fun convers@@ ation , you might want to say , &quot; So , you still want to get in this ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous time machine and go forward ? &quot;
Ab@@ solutely . Ab@@ solutely , I do .
It &apos;s st@@ uc@@ k in the present right now , but we have an amazing opportunity .
We can set that time machine on anything we want .
We can move it where we want to move it , and we &apos;re going to move it where we want to move it .
We have to have these convers@@ ations and we have to think , but when we get in the time machine and we go a@@ head , we &apos;re going to be happy we do .
I know that we can , and as far as I &apos;m concer@@ ned , that &apos;s something the world needs right now .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
One day , L@@ os An@@ gel@@ es Tim@@ es col@@ um@@ n@@ ist St@@ eve L@@ op@@ e@@ z was walking along the stre@@ ets of do@@ w@@ n@@ town L@@ os An@@ gel@@ es when he heard beautiful music .
And the source was a man , an Afric@@ an@@ -@@ American man , char@@ ming , ru@@ gg@@ ed , hom@@ eless , playing a viol@@ in that only had two str@@ ings .
And I &apos;m telling a story that many of you know , because St@@ eve &apos;s col@@ um@@ ns became the bas@@ is for a book , which was turned into a movie , with Rob@@ ert D@@ ow@@ ney J@@ r. ac@@ ting as St@@ eve L@@ op@@ e@@ z , and J@@ am@@ ie F@@ ox@@ x as N@@ a@@ th@@ an@@ i@@ el An@@ th@@ ony A@@ y@@ ers , the Ju@@ il@@ li@@ ard@@ -@@ train@@ ed d@@ ouble bas@@ si@@ st wh@@ ose prom@@ is@@ ing car@@ e@@ er was cut short by a trag@@ ic aff@@ l@@ ic@@ tion with par@@ an@@ o@@ id schi@@ z@@ op@@ h@@ ren@@ ia .
N@@ a@@ th@@ an@@ i@@ el dr@@ op@@ ped out of Ju@@ il@@ li@@ ard , he suff@@ ered a compl@@ ete bre@@ ak@@ down , and 30 years later he was living hom@@ eless on the stre@@ ets of S@@ kid R@@ ow in do@@ w@@ n@@ town L@@ os An@@ gel@@ es .
I en@@ cour@@ age all of you to read St@@ eve &apos;s book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful b@@ ond that form@@ ed between these two men ,
I &apos;m J@@ ane Mc@@ G@@ on@@ ig@@ al . I &apos;m a game designer .
I &apos;ve been making g@@ ames online now for 10 years , and my goal for the next dec@@ ade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online g@@ ames .
Now , I have a pl@@ an for this , and it ent@@ ail@@ s conv@@ inc@@ ing more people , inclu@@ ding all of you , to spend more time playing bigger and better g@@ ames .
Right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online g@@ ames .
Some of you might be thinking , &quot; That &apos;s a lot of time to spend playing g@@ ames .
May@@ be too much time , consider@@ ing how many ur@@ g@@ ent problems we have to solve in the real world . &quot;
But actually , accor@@ ding to my research at the In@@ st@@ itu@@ te for the F@@ ut@@ ure , actually the op@@ pos@@ ite is true .
Th@@ ree billion hours a week is not ne@@ arly enough game play to solve the world &apos;s most ur@@ g@@ ent problems .
In fact , I believe that if we want to sur@@ vive the next century on this planet , we need to incre@@ ase that tot@@ al d@@ ram@@ at@@ ically .
I &apos;ve calc@@ ul@@ ated the tot@@ al we need at 2@@ 1 billion hours of game play every week .
So , that &apos;s probably a bit of a coun@@ ter@@ -@@ intu@@ itive idea , so I &apos;ll say it again , let it sin@@ k in :
If we want to solve problems like hun@@ ger , poverty , climate change , global confl@@ ic@@ t , ob@@ es@@ ity , I believe that we need to as@@ pi@@ re to play g@@ ames online for at least 2@@ 1 billion hours a week , by the end of the next dec@@ ade . No . I &apos;m seri@@ ous . I am .
Here &apos;s why . This picture pretty much su@@ ms up why I think g@@ ames are so ess@@ ential to the future sur@@ viv@@ al of the human species . T@@ ru@@ ly .
This is a por@@ tra@@ it by photograp@@ her Ph@@ il T@@ ol@@ ed@@ ano . He wanted to cap@@ ture the emoti@@ on of g@@ am@@ ing ,
so he set up a camera in front of g@@ am@@ ers while they were playing .
And this is a clas@@ sic g@@ am@@ ing emoti@@ on .
Now , if you &apos;re not a g@@ am@@ er , you might mis@@ s some of the nu@@ ance in this ph@@ oto .
You probably see the sense of ur@@ gen@@ c@@ y , a little bit of fe@@ ar , but inten@@ se concentr@@ ation , deep , deep focus on t@@ ack@@ ling a really difficult problem .
If you are a g@@ am@@ er , you will not@@ ice a few nu@@ ances here : the cr@@ in@@ k@@ le of the eyes up , and around the m@@ outh is a sig@@ n of op@@ ti@@ mis@@ m ,
and the ey@@ eb@@ ro@@ ws up is sur@@ pri@@ se .
This is a g@@ am@@ er who &apos;s on the ver@@ ge of something called an &quot; epi@@ c win . &quot;
Oh , you &apos;ve heard of that .
OK , good , so we have some g@@ am@@ ers am@@ ong us .
A@@ n epi@@ c win is an out@@ come that is so extra@@ ordin@@ ari@@ ly positive , you had no idea it was even possible until you achi@@ ev@@ ed it .
It was almost beyond the th@@ res@@ hold of imagin@@ ation , and when you get there , you &apos;re sh@@ oc@@ ked to disc@@ over what you &apos;re tru@@ ly cap@@ able of . That &apos;s an epi@@ c win .
This is a g@@ am@@ er on the ver@@ ge of an epi@@ c win .
And this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem@@ -@@ sol@@ ver@@ s all over the world as we try to t@@ ack@@ le the ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les of the next century -- the face of someone who , against all od@@ ds , is on the ver@@ ge of an epi@@ c win .
Now , un@@ fortun@@ ately this is more of the face that we see in every@@ day life now as we try to t@@ ack@@ le ur@@ g@@ ent problems .
This is what I call the &quot; I &apos;m Not G@@ ood At Life &quot; face . This is actually me making it . Can you see ? Yes . G@@ ood .
This is me making the &quot; I &apos;m Not G@@ ood At Life &quot; face .
This is a piece of gr@@ aff@@ iti in my old neigh@@ bor@@ hood in Ber@@ k@@ el@@ ey , California , where I did my Ph@@ D on why we &apos;re better in g@@ ames than we are in real life .
And this is a problem that a lot of g@@ am@@ ers have . We feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in g@@ ames .
I don &apos;t mean just good as in success@@ ful , al@@ though that &apos;s part of it . We do achi@@ eve more in game worl@@ ds .
But I also mean good as in motiv@@ ated to do something that mat@@ ters -- inspi@@ red to collabor@@ ate and to coo@@ per@@ ate .
And when we &apos;re in game worl@@ ds , I believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves -- the most likely to help at a moment &apos;s not@@ ice , the most likely to st@@ ick with a problem as long at it takes , to get up after fail@@ ure and try again .
And in real life , when we face fail@@ ure , when we con@@ front ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les , we often don &apos;t feel that way . We feel over@@ come , we feel over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ed , we feel an@@ x@@ i@@ ous , maybe de@@ press@@ ed , fr@@ ustr@@ ated or cy@@ n@@ ical .
We never have those fe@@ el@@ ings when we &apos;re playing g@@ ames , they just don &apos;t ex@@ ist in g@@ ames .
So that &apos;s what I wanted to study when I was a grad@@ u@@ ate stud@@ ent .
What about g@@ ames makes it im@@ possible to feel that we can &apos;t achi@@ eve everything ?
How can we take those fe@@ el@@ ings from g@@ ames and app@@ ly them to real@@ -@@ world work ?
So I looked at g@@ ames like World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft , which is really the ide@@ al collabor@@ ative problem@@ -@@ sol@@ ving environment .
And I started to not@@ ice a few things that make epi@@ c w@@ ins so possible in online worl@@ ds .
The first thing is wh@@ en@@ ever you show up in one of these online g@@ ames , espe@@ cially in World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft , there are lots and lots of different charac@@ ters who are w@@ ill@@ ing to tr@@ ust you with a worl@@ d-@@ sav@@ ing mission , right away .
But not just any mission , it &apos;s a mission that is perf@@ ec@@ tly mat@@ ched with your curr@@ ent level in the game .
Right ? So you can do it .
They never give you a challenge you can &apos;t achi@@ eve .
But it is on the ver@@ ge of what you &apos;re cap@@ able of , so you have to try hard .
But there &apos;s no un@@ em@@ plo@@ y@@ ment in World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft ; no sitting around , wr@@ ing@@ ing your hands -- there &apos;s always something speci@@ fic and important to be done .
There are also t@@ ons of collabor@@ ators .
Every@@ where you go , hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achi@@ eve your epi@@ c mission .
That &apos;s not something we have in real life that easi@@ ly , this sense that at our fing@@ er@@ ti@@ ps are t@@ ons of collabor@@ ators .
And there &apos;s this epi@@ c story , this inspi@@ r@@ ing story of why we &apos;re there , and what we &apos;re doing ,
and we get all this positive fe@@ ed@@ back .
You guys have heard of lev@@ eling up , + 1 str@@ eng@@ th , + 1 intelligen@@ ce .
We don &apos;t get that kind of con@@ st@@ ant fe@@ ed@@ back in real life .
When I get off this stage , I &apos;m not going to have + 1 spe@@ a@@ king , and + 1 cra@@ z@@ y idea , + 20 cra@@ z@@ y idea .
I don &apos;t get that fe@@ ed@@ back in real life .
Now , the problem with collabor@@ ative online environ@@ ments like World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft is that it &apos;s so s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ying to be on the ver@@ ge of an epi@@ c win all the time , we deci@@ de to spend all our time in these game worl@@ ds .
It &apos;s just better than reality .
So , so far , coll@@ ec@@ ti@@ vely all the World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft g@@ am@@ ers have spent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years sol@@ ving the vir@@ tual problems of A@@ z@@ er@@ ot@@ h .
Now , that &apos;s not necessari@@ ly a bad thing .
It might sound like it &apos;s a bad thing . But to put that in cont@@ ext : 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years ago was when our ear@@ li@@ est prim@@ ate human anc@@ est@@ ors st@@ ood up .
That was the first u@@ pri@@ ght prim@@ ate .
So when we talk about how much time we &apos;re curr@@ ently inv@@ esting in playing g@@ ames , the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de of human evolution , which is an extra@@ ordinary thing . But it &apos;s also ap@@ t , because it turns out that by spen@@ ding all this time playing g@@ ames , we &apos;re actually changing what we are cap@@ able of as human be@@ ings . We &apos;re evol@@ ving to be a more collabor@@ ative and hear@@ ty species .
This is true . I believe this .
So , consi@@ der this really interesting statist@@ ic ;
it was recently publi@@ shed by a resear@@ ch@@ er at Car@@ ne@@ gi@@ e M@@ ell@@ on Univers@@ ity :
The average young person today in a country with a strong g@@ am@@ er culture will have spent 10@@ ,000 hours playing online g@@ ames by the age of 2@@ 1 .
Now 10@@ ,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reasons .
F@@ irst of all , for children in the United States , 10@@ ,@@ 0@@ 80 hours is the ex@@ act amount of time you will spend in school , from fi@@ f@@ th gr@@ ade to high school grad@@ u@@ ation , if you have perfect atten@@ d@@ ance .
So , we have an entire par@@ al@@ le@@ l tr@@ ack of education going on , where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good g@@ am@@ er as they &apos;re learning about everything else in school .
Some of you have probably read Mal@@ col@@ m G@@ lad@@ well &apos;s new book &quot; O@@ ut@@ li@@ ers , &quot;
so you would have heard of his theory of succ@@ ess , the &quot; 10@@ ,000 hours &quot; theory of succ@@ ess .
It &apos;s based on this great c@@ ogn@@ iti@@ ve@@ -@@ science research that says if we can ma@@ ster 10@@ ,000 hours of ef@@ fort@@ ful study at anything by the age of 2@@ 1 , we will be vir@@ tu@@ os@@ os at it .
We will be as good at whatever we do as the gre@@ at@@ est people in the world .
And so , now what we &apos;re looking at is an entire generation of young people who are vir@@ tu@@ oso g@@ am@@ ers .
So , the big question is , &quot; What exactly are g@@ am@@ ers getting so good at ? &quot;
Because if we could figure that out , we would have a vir@@ tually un@@ preced@@ ent@@ ed human resour@@ ce on our hands .
This is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online g@@ ames .
These are our vir@@ tu@@ oso g@@ am@@ ers ,
500 million people who are extra@@ ordin@@ ari@@ ly good at something .
And in the next dec@@ ade , we &apos;re going to have another billion g@@ am@@ ers who are extra@@ ordin@@ ari@@ ly good at whatever that is .
If you don &apos;t know it already , this is coming . The game industry is developing con@@ sol@@ es that are low@@ -@@ energy and that work with the w@@ ir@@ eless phone net@@ works instead of bro@@ ad@@ b@@ and Internet , so that g@@ am@@ ers all over the world , partic@@ ularly in India , China , Br@@ azi@@ l , can get online .
They exp@@ ect one billion more g@@ am@@ ers in the next dec@@ ade .
It will bring us up to 1@@ .@@ 5 billion g@@ am@@ ers .
So I &apos;ve started to think about what these g@@ ames are making us vir@@ tu@@ os@@ os at .
Here are the four things I came up with . The first is ur@@ g@@ ent op@@ ti@@ mis@@ m .
OK , think of this as ex@@ tr@@ eme self-@@ motiv@@ ation .
U@@ r@@ g@@ ent op@@ ti@@ mis@@ m is the des@@ ire to act immedi@@ ately to t@@ ack@@ le an ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le , combin@@ ed with the beli@@ ef that we have a reas@@ on@@ able hope of succ@@ ess .
G@@ am@@ ers always believe that an epi@@ c win is possible , and that it &apos;s always worth trying , and trying now .
G@@ am@@ ers don &apos;t sit around .
G@@ am@@ ers are vir@@ tu@@ os@@ os at we@@ av@@ ing a ti@@ ght social fab@@ ri@@ c .
There &apos;s a lot of interesting research that shows we like people better after we play a game with them , even if they &apos;ve be@@ at@@ en us b@@ ad@@ ly .
And the reason is , it takes a lot of tr@@ ust to play a game with someone . We tr@@ ust that they will spend their time with us , that they will play by the same rules , value the same goal , st@@ ay with the game until it &apos;s over .
And so , playing a game together actually buil@@ ds up b@@ on@@ ds and tr@@ ust and coo@@ per@@ ation .
And we actually build str@@ ong@@ er social relation@@ shi@@ ps as a result .
B@@ lis@@ s@@ ful produc@@ tivity . I love it .
You know , there &apos;s a reason why the average World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft g@@ am@@ er pl@@ ays for 2@@ 2 hours a week -- kind of a hal@@ f-@@ time job .
It &apos;s because we know , when we &apos;re playing a game , that we &apos;re actually hap@@ pi@@ er working hard than we are rel@@ ax@@ ing , or h@@ ang@@ ing out .
We know that we are op@@ ti@@ mi@@ zed as human be@@ ings , to do hard and mean@@ ing@@ ful work .
And g@@ am@@ ers are w@@ ill@@ ing to work hard all the time , if they &apos;re given the right work .
Fin@@ ally : epi@@ c mean@@ ing .
G@@ am@@ ers love to be at@@ ta@@ ched to a@@ we@@ -@@ inspi@@ r@@ ing mis@@ sions to human plan@@ et@@ ar@@ y-@@ scale stories .
So , just one bit of tri@@ via that hel@@ ps put that into per@@ spec@@ tive :
So , you all know Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia , bigg@@ est wi@@ k@@ i in the world .
Secon@@ d bigg@@ est wi@@ k@@ i in the world , with ne@@ arly 8@@ 0,000 artic@@ les , is the World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft wi@@ k@@ i . Fi@@ ve million people use it every month .
They have compi@@ led more information about World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft on the Internet than any other to@@ pi@@ c c@@ over@@ ed on any other wi@@ k@@ i in the world .
They are building an epi@@ c story .
They are building an epi@@ c knowledge resour@@ ce about the World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft .
Okay , so these are four super@@ po@@ wers that add up to one thing :
G@@ am@@ ers are super@@ -@@ em@@ power@@ ed hop@@ eful individu@@ als .
These are people who believe that they are individu@@ ally cap@@ able of changing the world .
And the only problem is , they believe that they are cap@@ able of changing vir@@ tual worl@@ ds and not the real world .
That &apos;s the problem that I &apos;m trying to solve .
There &apos;s an econom@@ ist nam@@ ed E@@ d@@ ward C@@ astr@@ on@@ ov@@ a .
H@@ is work is bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant . He looks at why people are inv@@ esting so much time and energy and money in online worl@@ ds .
And he says , &quot; We &apos;re w@@ it@@ ness@@ ing what am@@ oun@@ ts to no less than a mass ex@@ o@@ du@@ s to vir@@ tual worl@@ ds and online game environ@@ ments . &quot;
And he &apos;s an econom@@ ist , so he &apos;s r@@ ational . And he says -- Not like me , I &apos;m a game designer ; I &apos;m ex@@ u@@ ber@@ ant .
But he says that this makes perfect sense , because g@@ am@@ ers can achi@@ eve more in online worl@@ ds than they can in real life .
They can have str@@ ong@@ er social relation@@ shi@@ ps in g@@ ames than they can have in real life ;
they get better fe@@ ed@@ back and feel more re@@ war@@ ded in g@@ ames than they do in real life .
So he says , for now it makes perfect sense for g@@ am@@ ers to spend more time in vir@@ tual worl@@ ds than the real world . Now , I also ag@@ ree that that is r@@ ational , for now . But it is not , by any means , an op@@ tim@@ al situation . We have to start making the real world work more like a game .
I take my inspi@@ r@@ ation from something that happened 2@@ ,@@ 500 years ago .
These are anci@@ ent dice , made out of sh@@ e@@ ep &apos;s k@@ nuc@@ k@@ les . Be@@ fore we had aw@@ es@@ ome game controll@@ ers , we had sh@@ e@@ ep &apos;s k@@ nuc@@ k@@ les . And these re@@ present the first game equ@@ ip@@ ment designed by human be@@ ings ,
and if you &apos;re famili@@ ar with the work of the anci@@ ent Gre@@ e@@ k hist@@ ori@@ an H@@ er@@ od@@ ot@@ us , you might know this history ,
which is the history of who invent@@ ed g@@ ames and why .
H@@ er@@ od@@ ot@@ us says that g@@ ames , partic@@ ularly dice g@@ ames , were invent@@ ed in the k@@ ing@@ dom of L@@ y@@ dia , during a time of fam@@ ine .
Ap@@ par@@ ently , there was such a s@@ ev@@ ere fam@@ ine that the king of L@@ y@@ dia decided they had to do something cra@@ z@@ y .
People were suff@@ ering . People were fi@@ gh@@ ting . It was an ex@@ tr@@ eme situation , they needed an ex@@ tr@@ eme solution .
So , accor@@ ding to H@@ er@@ od@@ ot@@ us , they invent@@ ed dice g@@ ames , and they set up a k@@ ing@@ dom@@ -@@ wi@@ de polic@@ y :
On one day , everybody would eat ,
and on the next day , everybody would play g@@ ames .
And they would be so im@@ mer@@ s@@ ed in playing the dice g@@ ames , because g@@ ames are so eng@@ aging , and im@@ mer@@ se us in such s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ying , b@@ lis@@ s@@ ful produc@@ tivity , they would ig@@ n@@ ore the fact that they had no food to eat .
And then on the next day , they would play g@@ ames ; and on the next day , they would eat .
And accor@@ ding to H@@ er@@ od@@ ot@@ us , they pass@@ ed 18 years this way , sur@@ viv@@ ing through a fam@@ ine , by e@@ ating on one day , and playing g@@ ames on the next .
Now , this is exactly , I think , how we &apos;re using g@@ ames today . We &apos;re using g@@ ames to es@@ cap@@ e real@@ -@@ world suff@@ ering --
we &apos;re using g@@ ames to get away
from everything that &apos;s bro@@ ken in the real environment , everything that &apos;s not s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ying about real life , and we &apos;re getting what we need from g@@ ames .
But it doesn &apos;t have to end there .
This is really exciting . Ac@@ cor@@ ding to H@@ er@@ od@@ ot@@ us , after 18 years the fam@@ ine wasn &apos;t getting better , so the king decided they would play one fin@@ al dice game .
They divi@@ ded the entire k@@ ing@@ dom in half . They play@@ ed one dice game , and the w@@ inn@@ ers of that game got to go on an epi@@ c ad@@ vent@@ ure .
They would leave L@@ y@@ dia , and they would go out in se@@ ar@@ ch of a new place to live , le@@ av@@ ing behind just enough people to sur@@ vive on the resources that were available , and hop@@ ef@@ ully to take their civi@@ li@@ zation some@@ where else where they could th@@ ri@@ ve .
Now , this s@@ ounds cra@@ z@@ y , right ?
But recently , DNA evid@@ ence has sho@@ wn that the E@@ tr@@ us@@ can@@ s , who then led to the R@@ om@@ an E@@ m@@ pi@@ re , actually share the same DNA as the anci@@ ent L@@ y@@ di@@ ans .
And so , recently , scientists have sugg@@ ested that H@@ er@@ od@@ ot@@ us &apos; cra@@ z@@ y story is actually true .
And ge@@ olog@@ ists have found evid@@ ence of a global co@@ ol@@ ing that l@@ ast@@ ed for ne@@ arly 20 years , that could have expl@@ ain@@ ed the fam@@ ine .
So this cra@@ z@@ y story might be true . They might have actually sav@@ ed their culture by playing g@@ ames , es@@ cap@@ ing to g@@ ames for 18 years , and then been so inspi@@ red , and knew so much about how to come together with g@@ ames , that they actually sav@@ ed the entire civi@@ li@@ zation that way .
Okay , we can do that .
We &apos;ve been playing W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft since 199@@ 4 .
That was the first real@@ -@@ time str@@ at@@ eg@@ y game from the World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft series . That was 16 years ago .
They play@@ ed dice g@@ ames for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft for 16 years .
I say we are ready for our own epi@@ c game .
Now , they had half the civi@@ li@@ zation go off in se@@ ar@@ ch of a new world ,
so that &apos;s where I get my 2@@ 1 billion hours a week of g@@ am@@ e-@@ play from .
Let &apos;s get half of us to ag@@ ree to spend an hour a day playing g@@ ames , until we solve real@@ -@@ world problems .
Now , I know you &apos;re asking , &quot; How are we going to solve real@@ -@@ world problems in g@@ ames ? &quot; Well , that &apos;s what I &apos;ve dev@@ ot@@ ed my work to over the past few years , at the In@@ st@@ itu@@ te for the F@@ ut@@ ure .
We have this ban@@ ner in our off@@ ices in P@@ al@@ o Al@@ to , and it ex@@ press@@ es our view of how we should try to rel@@ ate to the future .
We do not want to try to predic@@ t the future .
What we want to do is make the future .
We want to imagine the b@@ est@@ -@@ case scen@@ ario out@@ come , and then we want to em@@ power people to make that out@@ come a reality .
We want to imagine epi@@ c w@@ ins , and then give people the means to achi@@ eve the epi@@ c win .
I &apos;m just going to very bri@@ ef@@ ly show you three g@@ ames that I &apos;ve made that are an att@@ em@@ pt to give people the means to create epi@@ c w@@ ins in their own fut@@ u@@ res .
This is World Wi@@ th@@ out O@@ il .
We made this game in 200@@ 7 .
This is an online game in which you try to sur@@ vive an oil shor@@ t@@ age .
The oil shor@@ t@@ age is fic@@ ti@@ onal , but we put enough online cont@@ ent out there for you to believe that it &apos;s real , and to live your real life as if we &apos;ve run out of oil . So when you come to the game , you sig@@ n up , tell us where you live , and then we give you real@@ -@@ time news vide@@ os , data fe@@ eds that show you exactly how much oil cos@@ ts , what &apos;s not available , how food sup@@ ply is being aff@@ ected ,
how trans@@ port@@ ation is being aff@@ ected , if schools are clos@@ ed , if there &apos;s ri@@ ot@@ ing , and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true . And then we ask you to blog about it , to pos@@ t vide@@ os , to pos@@ t ph@@ ot@@ os .
We pi@@ l@@ ot@@ ed this game with 1@@ ,@@ 7@@ 00 play@@ ers in 200@@ 7 , and we &apos;ve trac@@ ked them for the three years since . And I can tell you that this is a transform@@ ative experience .
No@@ body wants to change how they live , just because it &apos;s good for the world , or because we &apos;re sup@@ posed to .
But if you im@@ mer@@ se them in an epi@@ c ad@@ vent@@ ure and tell them , &quot; We &apos;ve run out of oil .
This is an amazing story and ad@@ vent@@ ure for you to go on .
Ch@@ all@@ enge yourself to see how you would sur@@ vive , &quot;
most of our play@@ ers have ke@@ pt up the h@@ ab@@ its that they learned in this game .
So for the next worl@@ d-@@ sav@@ ing game , we decided to ai@@ m high@@ er -- bigger problem than just pe@@ ak oil .
We did a game called Su@@ per@@ struc@@ t at the In@@ st@@ itu@@ te for the F@@ ut@@ ure . And the pre@@ mi@@ se was , a super@@ computer has calc@@ ul@@ ated that humans have only 2@@ 3 years left on the planet .
This super@@ computer was called the G@@ lob@@ al Ex@@ t@@ inc@@ tion A@@ war@@ en@@ ess S@@ y@@ stem , of course .
We asked people to come online -- almost like a J@@ er@@ ry Br@@ uc@@ k@@ he@@ im@@ er movie .
You know J@@ er@@ ry Br@@ uc@@ k@@ he@@ im@@ er mov@@ ies , you form a dre@@ am team -- you &apos;ve got the astr@@ on@@ a@@ ut , the scienti@@ st , the ex@@ -@@ con@@ vic@@ t , and they all have something to do to save the world . But in our game , instead of just having five people on the dre@@ am team , we said , &quot; Every@@ body &apos;s on the dre@@ am team , and it &apos;s your job to inv@@ ent the future of energy , the future of food , the future of health , the future of sec@@ ur@@ ity and the future of the social s@@ af@@ ety net . &quot;
We had 8@@ ,000 people play that game for eight weeks . They came up with 500 in@@ san@@ ely creative solu@@ tions that you can go online , Google &quot; Su@@ per@@ struc@@ t , &quot; and see .
So , finally , the last game , we &apos;re la@@ un@@ ching it Mar@@ ch 3@@ r@@ d . This is a game done with the World B@@ ank In@@ st@@ itu@@ te .
If you compl@@ ete the game , you will be cer@@ ti@@ fied by the World B@@ ank In@@ st@@ itu@@ te as a S@@ oci@@ al In@@ nov@@ ator , clas@@ s of 20@@ 10 .
Wor@@ king with univers@@ ities all over sub@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ har@@ an Africa , and we are inv@@ iting them to learn social innov@@ ation sk@@ ill@@ s .
We &apos;ve got a grap@@ hic nov@@ el , we &apos;ve got lev@@ eling up in sk@@ ill@@ s like local insi@@ ght , knowledge net@@ working , sustain@@ ability , vision and resour@@ c@@ ef@@ ul@@ ness .
I would like to inv@@ ite all of you to pl@@ ease share this game with young people , any@@ where in the world , partic@@ ularly in developing areas , who might benef@@ it from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enter@@ pris@@ es to save the world .
So , I &apos;m going to w@@ ra@@ p up now .
I want to ask a question .
What do you think happens next ?
We &apos;ve got all these amazing g@@ am@@ ers , we &apos;ve got these g@@ ames that are kind of pi@@ lots of what we might do , but n@@ one of them have sav@@ ed the real world yet .
Well I hope you will ag@@ ree with me that g@@ am@@ ers are a human resour@@ ce that we can use to do real@@ -@@ world work , that g@@ ames are a powerful pl@@ at@@ form for change . We have all these amazing super@@ po@@ wers : b@@ lis@@ s@@ ful produc@@ tivity , the ability to we@@ ave a ti@@ ght social fab@@ ri@@ c , this feeling of ur@@ g@@ ent op@@ ti@@ mis@@ m and the des@@ ire for epi@@ c mean@@ ing .
I really hope that we can come together to play g@@ ames that matter , to sur@@ vive on this planet for another century . That &apos;s my hope , that you will jo@@ in me in making and playing g@@ ames like this .
When I look forward to the next dec@@ ade , I know two things for sure : that we can make any future we can imagine , and we can play any g@@ ames we want , so I say :
Let the worl@@ d-@@ changing g@@ ames begin .
Thank you .
For some time I have been interested in the plac@@ eb@@ o effect , which might seem like an od@@ d thing for a mag@@ ici@@ an to be interested in , un@@ less you think of it in the terms that I do , which is , &quot; Some@@ thing fa@@ ke is believ@@ ed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real . &quot; In other words , su@@ g@@ ar pi@@ l@@ ls have a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in certain kinds of studi@@ es , the plac@@ eb@@ o effect , just because the person thin@@ ks
that what &apos;s happening to them is a ph@@ ar@@ mac@@ e@@ ut@@ ical or some sort of a --
for p@@ ain man@@ ag@@ ement , for example , if they believe it enough there is a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in the body called the plac@@ eb@@ o effect .
Some@@ thing fa@@ ke becomes something real because of someone &apos;s perc@@ ep@@ tion of it .
In order for us to understand each other , I want to start by showing you a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary , very simple mag@@ ic tr@@ ick .
And I &apos;m going to show you how it works . This is a tr@@ ick that &apos;s been in every children &apos;s mag@@ ic book since at least the 19@@ 5@@ 0s .
I learned it myself from C@@ u@@ b Sc@@ out M@@ ag@@ ic in the 19@@ 7@@ 0s .
I &apos;ll do it for you , and then I &apos;ll explain it .
And then I &apos;ll explain why I expl@@ ain@@ ed it .
So , here &apos;s what happens .
The k@@ ni@@ fe , which you can exam@@ ine ; my hand , which you could exam@@ ine .
I &apos;m just going to hold the k@@ ni@@ fe in my fi@@ st like this .
I &apos;ll get my sle@@ eve back .
And to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ eve
I &apos;m just going to squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze my w@@ ri@@ st right here .
That way you can see that at no time can anything trav@@ el , as long as I &apos;m squ@@ e@@ e@@ zing there nothing can go up or down my sle@@ eve .
And the object of this is quite simple .
I &apos;m going to open my hand , and hop@@ ef@@ ully , if all is well , my pure animal mag@@ ne@@ tis@@ m will hold the k@@ ni@@ fe .
In fact it &apos;s hel@@ d so ti@@ gh@@ tly in place that I can sh@@ ake it , and the k@@ ni@@ fe does not come off .
No@@ thing goes up or down my sle@@ eve ,
no tr@@ ick@@ ery . And you can exam@@ ine everything .
T@@ a-@@ da !
So , this is a tr@@ ick that I often teach to young children
that are interested in mag@@ ic , because you can learn a great deal about dec@@ ep@@ tion by stud@@ ying this very -- even though it &apos;s a very simple tr@@ ick me@@ th@@ od@@ olog@@ ically .
Pro@@ b@@ ably many of you in the room know this tr@@ ick .
What happens is this . I hold the k@@ ni@@ fe in my hand .
I say I &apos;m going to gra@@ b hold of my w@@ ri@@ st
to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ eve , that is a li@@ e .
The reason I &apos;m hol@@ ding onto my w@@ ri@@ st is because that &apos;s actually the sec@@ re@@ t of the il@@ lu@@ sion .
In a moment when my hand mov@@ es from fac@@ ing you to being away from you , this fing@@ er right here , my inde@@ x fing@@ er is just going to shi@@ ft from where it is , to a pos@@ ition poin@@ ting out like this . N@@ ice one .
Some@@ one who didn &apos;t have a chil@@ d@@ hood is out there .
So , it goes like this , from here , right .
And as I move around my fing@@ er shi@@ f@@ ts .
And we could talk about why this is dec@@ ep@@ tive , why you don &apos;t not@@ ice there are only three fing@@ ers down here , because the mind , and the way it process@@ es information , it doesn &apos;t coun@@ t , one , two , three . It grou@@ ps them .
But that &apos;s not really what this is about . Right ? And then I open my hand up . Ob@@ vi@@ ously it &apos;s cl@@ ing@@ ing there , not by animal mag@@ ne@@ tis@@ m , but by ch@@ ic@@ an@@ ery , my inde@@ x fing@@ er being there .
And then when I close my fing@@ er , same thing , as I move back , this moti@@ on kind of c@@ ov@@ ers the moving back of my fing@@ er .
I take this hand away . You give the k@@ ni@@ fe out .
There is a tr@@ ick you can do for your friends and neigh@@ b@@ ors . Th@@ an@@ ks .
Now , what does that have to do with the plac@@ eb@@ o effect ?
I read a study a year or so ago that really b@@ le@@ w my mind wi@@ de open .
I &apos;m not a doc@@ tor or a resear@@ ch@@ er , so this , to me , was an ast@@ oni@@ shing thing .
It turns out that if you ad@@ min@@ ist@@ er a plac@@ eb@@ o in the form of a white pi@@ ll , that &apos;s like as@@ pir@@ in sh@@ ap@@ ed -- it &apos;s just a r@@ ound white pi@@ ll -- it has some certain meas@@ ur@@ able effect .
But if you change the form that you give the plac@@ eb@@ o in , like you make a small@@ er pi@@ ll , and color it blue , and st@@ am@@ p a l@@ etter into it , it is actually meas@@ ur@@ ably more eff@@ ective .
E@@ ven though ne@@ i@@ ther one of these things has any ph@@ ar@@ mac@@ e@@ ut@@ ical -- they &apos;re su@@ g@@ ar pi@@ l@@ ls .
But a white pi@@ ll is not as good as a blue pi@@ ll .
What ? That really f@@ li@@ p@@ ped me out .
Tur@@ ns out though , that that &apos;s not even where it st@@ ops .
If you have cap@@ sul@@ es , they &apos;re more eff@@ ective than t@@ ab@@ l@@ ets in any form .
A col@@ or@@ ed cap@@ su@@ le , that &apos;s y@@ el@@ low on one end and red on the other is better than a white cap@@ su@@ le .
D@@ os@@ age has something to do with this .
One pi@@ ll tw@@ ice a day is not as good at three pi@@ l@@ ls -- I don &apos;t remember the statist@@ ic now . S@@ or@@ ry .
But the point is ...
... these d@@ os@@ ages have something to do with it .
And the form has something to do with it .
And if you want the ul@@ tim@@ ate in plac@@ eb@@ o , you &apos;ve go to the ne@@ ed@@ le .
Right ? A sy@@ r@@ ing@@ e with some in@@ ert -- a couple C@@ C@@ s of some in@@ ert something ,
and you in@@ ject this into a patient ...
Well this is such a powerful image in their mind , it &apos;s so much str@@ ong@@ er than the white pi@@ ll .
It &apos;s a really , this grap@@ h , well I &apos;ll show it to you some other time when we have sli@@ des .
The point is the white pi@@ ll is not as good as the blue pi@@ ll is not as good as the cap@@ su@@ le is not as good as the ne@@ ed@@ le .
And n@@ one of it has any real ph@@ ar@@ mac@@ e@@ ut@@ ical quality ,
it &apos;s only your beli@@ ef that makes it real in your body and makes a str@@ ong@@ er effect .
I wanted to see if I could take that idea and app@@ ly it to a mag@@ ic tr@@ ick .
And take something that is obvi@@ ously a fa@@ ke tr@@ ick and make it seem real .
And we know from that study that when you want reality , you go to the ne@@ ed@@ le .
This is a s@@ ev@@ en@@ -@@ in@@ ch h@@ at@@ p@@ in . It &apos;s very , very shar@@ p ,
and I &apos;m going to just st@@ eri@@ li@@ ze it a tiny bit .
This is really my fl@@ es@@ h . This is not D@@ am@@ i@@ an &apos;s speci@@ al@@ -@@ gro@@ wn fl@@ es@@ h .
That &apos;s my sk@@ in right there . This is not a H@@ oll@@ y@@ wood speci@@ al effect .
I &apos;m going to pi@@ er@@ ce my sk@@ in and run this ne@@ ed@@ le through to the other side .
If you &apos;re qu@@ easy -- if you f@@ ain@@ t easi@@ ly -- I was doing this for some friends in the h@@ ot@@ el room last night , and some people that I didn &apos;t know , and one woman almost pass@@ ed out .
So , I sugg@@ est if you get qu@@ easy easy that you look away for about the next 30 -- in fact , you know what , I &apos;ll do the first bad part behind it .
You &apos;ll get to see , you can look away too if you &apos;d like to .
So , here is what happens , right here , the beginning of my fl@@ es@@ h at the lo@@ wer part of my ar@@ m I just make a little pi@@ er@@ ce .
I &apos;m sor@@ ry , man . A@@ m I fre@@ a@@ king you out ?
OK , and then just through my sk@@ in a tiny bit , and then out the other side like this .
Now , ess@@ entially we &apos;re in the same pos@@ ition we were in with the k@@ ni@@ fe tr@@ ick .
S@@ or@@ t of . But you can &apos;t coun@@ t my fing@@ ers right now can you ?
So , let me show them to you . That &apos;s one , two three , four , five . Yes , well ...
I know what people think when they see this .
They go , &quot; Well , he &apos;s certainly not d@@ um@@ b enough to sta@@ b h@@ im@@ self through the sk@@ in to enter@@ tain us for a few minutes .
So , let me give you a little pe@@ e@@ k .
How &apos;s that look out there ? P@@ ret@@ ty good .
Yeah , I know . And the people in the back go , &quot; OK , I didn &apos;t really see that . &quot;
People in the sat@@ ell@@ ite room are starting to move in now .
Let me give you good close look at this .
That really is my sk@@ in . That is not a H@@ oll@@ y@@ wood speci@@ al effect .
That &apos;s my fl@@ es@@ h , and I can tw@@ ist that around .
I &apos;m sor@@ ry . If you &apos;re getting qu@@ easy , look away , don &apos;t look at the thing .
People in the back or people on video years from now wat@@ ching this will go , &quot; Well ye@@ ah , that looks kind of ne@@ at in some sort of effect there , but if it were real he would be --
see there &apos;s a h@@ ole there and a h@@ ole there , if it were real he would be b@@ le@@ ed@@ ing .
Well let me work up some blood for you .
Yes , there it is .
Nor@@ m@@ ally now , I would take the ne@@ ed@@ le out .
I would cle@@ an off my ar@@ m , and I would show you that there are no w@@ ounds .
But I think in this cont@@ ext and with the idea of taking something fa@@ ke and making it into something real , I &apos;m just going to leave it there , and walk off the stage .
I will be seeing you several times over the next few days . I hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . Thank you very much .
So , I &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
I &apos;ve lov@@ ed only two .
That first one , it was more like a pas@@ sion@@ ate aff@@ air .
It was a beautiful fish : f@@ lavor@@ ful , t@@ ex@@ tu@@ red , me@@ at@@ y , a b@@ est@@ sel@@ ler on the men@@ u .
What a fish .
E@@ ven better , it was far@@ m@@ -@@ ra@@ is@@ ed to the sup@@ posed high@@ est stand@@ ar@@ ds of sustain@@ ability .
So you could feel good about sel@@ ling it .
I was in a relationship with this be@@ aut@@ y for several months .
One day , the head of the company called and asked if I &apos;d speak at an ev@@ ent about the far@@ m &apos;s sustain@@ ability .
&quot; Ab@@ solutely , &quot; I said .
Here was a company trying to solve what &apos;s become this un@@ imagin@@ able problem for us ch@@ ef@@ s :
How do we keep fish on our men@@ us ?
For the past 50 years , we &apos;ve been fi@@ shing the se@@ as like we c@@ lear@@ -@@ cut for@@ ests .
It &apos;s hard to over@@ state the des@@ truc@@ tion .
N@@ in@@ ety percent of large fish , the ones we love -- the t@@ un@@ as , the h@@ ali@@ b@@ uts , the sal@@ mon@@ s , s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish -- they &apos;ve coll@@ ap@@ s@@ ed .
There &apos;s almost nothing left .
So , for better or for wor@@ se , a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture , fish far@@ ming , is going to be a part of our future .
A lot of arg@@ um@@ ents against it :
F@@ ish far@@ ms pol@@ lu@@ te -- most of them do any@@ way -- and they &apos;re in@@ effici@@ ent . T@@ ake t@@ una ,
a major dra@@ w@@ back . It &apos;s got a fe@@ ed conver@@ sion r@@ ati@@ o of 15 to one .
That means it takes fi@@ f@@ te@@ en p@@ ounds of w@@ ild fish to get you one p@@ ound of far@@ m t@@ una .
Not very sustain@@ able .
It doesn &apos;t tast@@ e very good either .
So here , finally , was a company trying to do it right .
I wanted to support them .
The day before the ev@@ ent , I called the head of P@@ .@@ R@@ . for the company .
Let &apos;s call him Don .
&quot; Don , &quot; I said , &quot; just to get the fac@@ ts str@@ ai@@ ght , you guys are fam@@ ous for far@@ ming so far out to sea , you don &apos;t pol@@ lu@@ te . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s right , &quot; he said . &quot; We &apos;re so far out , the w@@ aste from our fish gets distri@@ b@@ ut@@ ed , not concentr@@ ated . &quot;
And then he ad@@ ded , &quot; We &apos;re basically a world un@@ to ourselves .
That fe@@ ed conver@@ sion r@@ ati@@ o ? 2@@ .@@ 5 to one , &quot; he said .
&quot; B@@ est in the business . &quot;
2@@ .@@ 5 to one , great .
&quot; 2@@ .@@ 5 what ? What are you fe@@ ed@@ ing ? &quot;
&quot; Su@@ st@@ ain@@ able prote@@ ins , &quot; he said .
&quot; Gre@@ at , &quot; I said . G@@ ot off the phone .
And that night , I was l@@ ying in bed , and I thought : What the h@@ ell is a sustain@@ able prote@@ in ?
So the next day , just before the ev@@ ent , I called Don .
I said , &quot; Don , what are some examples of sustain@@ able prote@@ ins ? &quot;
He said he didn &apos;t know . He would ask around .
Well , I got on the phone with a few people in the company ; no one could give me a str@@ ai@@ ght answer
until finally , I got on the phone with the head biolog@@ ist .
Let &apos;s call him Don too .
&quot; Don , &quot; I said , &quot; what are some examples of sustain@@ able prote@@ ins ? &quot;
Well , he men@@ tion@@ ed some al@@ ga@@ es and some fish me@@ als , and then he said ch@@ ick@@ en p@@ ell@@ ets .
I said , &quot; Ch@@ ick@@ en p@@ ell@@ ets ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Yeah , fe@@ a@@ thers , sk@@ in , b@@ one me@@ al , sc@@ rap@@ s , dri@@ ed and process@@ ed into fe@@ ed . &quot;
I said , &quot; What perc@@ ent@@ age of your fe@@ ed is ch@@ ick@@ en ? &quot;
Th@@ in@@ king , you know , two percent .
&quot; Well , it &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
I said , &quot; Don , what &apos;s sustain@@ able about fe@@ ed@@ ing ch@@ ick@@ en to fish ? &quot;
There was a long p@@ ause on the line , and he said , &quot; There &apos;s just too much ch@@ ick@@ en in the world . &quot;
I f@@ ell out of love with this fish .
No , not because I &apos;m some self-@@ ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous , go@@ od@@ y-@@ two sho@@ es f@@ oo@@ die .
I actually am .
No , I actually f@@ ell out of love with this fish because , I s@@ we@@ ar to God , after that convers@@ ation , the fish tast@@ ed like ch@@ ick@@ en .
This second fish , it &apos;s a different kind of love story .
It &apos;s the rom@@ anti@@ c kind , the kind where the more you get to know your fish , you love the fish .
I first ate it at a res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ant in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n Sp@@ ain .
A jour@@ n@@ al@@ ist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time .
She kind of set us up .
It came to the table a b@@ right , almost sh@@ im@@ mer@@ ing , white color .
The che@@ f had over@@ coo@@ ked it .
Li@@ ke tw@@ ice over .
A@@ ma@@ z@@ ingly , it was still del@@ ici@@ ous .
W@@ ho can make a fish tast@@ e good after it &apos;s been over@@ coo@@ ked ?
I can &apos;t , but this guy can .
Let &apos;s call him Mi@@ gu@@ el --
actually his name is Mi@@ gu@@ el .
And no , he didn &apos;t c@@ ook the fish , and he &apos;s not a che@@ f ,
at least in the way that you and I understand it .
He &apos;s a biolog@@ ist at V@@ eta La P@@ al@@ ma . It &apos;s a fish far@@ m in the s@@ ou@@ th@@ w@@ ester@@ n cor@@ ner of Sp@@ ain . It &apos;s at the ti@@ p of the Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r riv@@ er .
Un@@ til the 198@@ 0s , the far@@ m was in the hands of the Ar@@ g@@ ent@@ ini@@ ans .
They ra@@ is@@ ed be@@ ef c@@ att@@ le on what was ess@@ entially w@@ et@@ l@@ ands .
They did it by dra@@ in@@ ing the land . They built this intr@@ ic@@ ate series of can@@ als , and they p@@ ush@@ ed water off the land and out into the riv@@ er .
Well , they couldn &apos;t make it work , not econom@@ ically .
And ec@@ olog@@ ically , it was a dis@@ aster .
It kill@@ ed like 90 percent of the bir@@ ds , which , for this place , is a lot of bir@@ ds .
And so in 198@@ 2 , a S@@ pan@@ ish company with an environ@@ mental con@@ science pur@@ ch@@ as@@ ed the land .
What did they do ?
They re@@ vers@@ ed the f@@ low of water .
They literally f@@ li@@ p@@ ped the sw@@ it@@ ch .
In@@ ste@@ ad of p@@ ush@@ ing water out , they used the chan@@ nel@@ s to pul@@ l water back in .
They f@@ loo@@ ded the can@@ als .
They created a 2@@ 7@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0-@@ ac@@ re fish far@@ m -- bas@@ s , m@@ ul@@ let , sh@@ rim@@ p , e@@ el -- and in the process , Mi@@ gu@@ el and this company completely re@@ vers@@ ed the ec@@ olog@@ ical des@@ truc@@ tion .
The far@@ m &apos;s incredible .
I mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
You stare out at a h@@ ori@@ z@@ on that is a million miles away , and all you see are f@@ loo@@ ded can@@ als and this th@@ ick , r@@ ich mar@@ sh@@ land .
I was there not long ago with Mi@@ gu@@ el .
He &apos;s an amazing guy , like three parts Charles Dar@@ win and one part C@@ ro@@ co@@ di@@ le D@@ un@@ de@@ e .
Okay ? There we are sl@@ ogg@@ ing through the w@@ et@@ l@@ ands , and I &apos;m p@@ ant@@ ing and s@@ we@@ ating , got mu@@ d up to my k@@ ne@@ es , and Mi@@ gu@@ el &apos;s cal@@ m@@ ly cond@@ uc@@ ting a biolog@@ y lec@@ ture .
Here , he &apos;s poin@@ ting out a r@@ are B@@ l@@ ack@@ -@@ sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der@@ ed K@@ ite .
Now , he &apos;s men@@ tion@@ ing the min@@ er@@ al needs of phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton . And here , here he se@@ es a grou@@ ping pattern that re@@ min@@ ds him of the T@@ anz@@ an@@ i@@ an Gi@@ ra@@ ff@@ e .
It turns out , Mi@@ gu@@ el spent the better part of his car@@ e@@ er in the Mi@@ k@@ um@@ i National Par@@ k in Africa .
I asked him how he became such an ex@@ per@@ t on fish .
He said , &quot; F@@ ish ? I didn &apos;t know anything about fish .
I &apos;m an ex@@ per@@ t in relation@@ shi@@ ps . &quot;
And then he &apos;s off , la@@ un@@ ching into more talk about r@@ are bir@@ ds and al@@ ga@@ es and stran@@ ge a@@ qu@@ atic plants .
And don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fas@@ cin@@ ating , you know , the biot@@ ic community un@@ pl@@ ugg@@ ed , kind of thing .
It &apos;s great , but I was in love .
And my head was sw@@ o@@ on@@ ing over that over@@ coo@@ ked piece of del@@ ici@@ ous fish I had the night before .
So I inter@@ r@@ up@@ ted him . I said , &quot; Mi@@ gu@@ el , what makes your fish tast@@ e so good ? &quot;
He poin@@ ted at the al@@ ga@@ e .
&quot; I know , du@@ de , the al@@ ga@@ e , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the relation@@ shi@@ ps : It &apos;s amazing .
But what are your fish e@@ ating ?
What &apos;s the fe@@ ed conver@@ sion r@@ ati@@ o ? &quot;
Well , he goes on to tell me it &apos;s such a r@@ ich system that the fish are e@@ ating what they &apos;d be e@@ ating in the w@@ ild .
The pl@@ ant bi@@ om@@ as@@ s , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the z@@ o@@ op@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , it &apos;s what fe@@ eds the fish .
The system is so heal@@ thy , it &apos;s totally self-@@ ren@@ e@@ wing .
There is no fe@@ ed .
E@@ v@@ er heard of a far@@ m that doesn &apos;t fe@@ ed its animals ?
L@@ ater that day , I was driv@@ ing around this proper@@ ty with Mi@@ gu@@ el , and I asked him , I said , &quot; For a place that seems so natural , un@@ like like any far@@ m I &apos;d ever been at , how do you meas@@ ure succ@@ ess ? &quot;
At that moment , it was as if a film direc@@ tor called for a set change .
And we r@@ oun@@ ded the cor@@ ner and saw the most amazing si@@ ght : thousands and thousands of p@@ ink fl@@ amin@@ go@@ s , a liter@@ al p@@ ink car@@ pe@@ t for as far as you could see .
&quot; That &apos;s succ@@ ess , &quot; he said .
&quot; Look at their bel@@ lies , p@@ ink .
They &apos;re fe@@ ast@@ ing . &quot;
F@@ e@@ ast@@ ing ? I was totally con@@ f@@ used .
I said , &quot; Mi@@ gu@@ el , aren &apos;t they fe@@ ast@@ ing on your fish ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; We lose 20 percent of our fish and fish e@@ gg@@ s to bir@@ ds .
Well , last year , this proper@@ ty had 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 bir@@ ds on it , more than 2@@ 50 different species .
It &apos;s become , today , the larg@@ est and one of the most important priv@@ ate bir@@ d s@@ anc@@ tu@@ ar@@ ies in all of Europe . &quot;
I said , &quot; Mi@@ gu@@ el , isn &apos;t a th@@ riv@@ ing bir@@ d population like the last thing you want on a fish far@@ m ? &quot;
He sh@@ ook his head , no .
He said , &quot; We far@@ m ex@@ ten@@ si@@ vely , not inten@@ si@@ vely .
This is an ec@@ olog@@ ical network .
The fl@@ amin@@ go@@ s eat the sh@@ rim@@ p .
The sh@@ rim@@ p eat the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
So the p@@ in@@ ker the bel@@ ly , the better the system . &quot;
Okay , so let &apos;s re@@ view : a far@@ m that doesn &apos;t fe@@ ed its animals , and a far@@ m that meas@@ u@@ res its succ@@ ess on the health of its pre@@ d@@ ators .
A fish far@@ m , but also a bir@@ d s@@ anc@@ tu@@ ary .
Oh , and by the way , those fl@@ amin@@ go@@ s , they sh@@ ouldn &apos;t even be there in the first place .
They bro@@ od in a town 1@@ 50 miles away , where the so@@ il cond@@ itions are better for building n@@ ests .
E@@ very morning , they fly 1@@ 50 miles into the far@@ m . And every ev@@ ening , they fly 1@@ 50 miles back .
They do that because they &apos;re able to fol@@ low the bro@@ ken white line of high@@ way A@@ 9@@ 2 .
No k@@ id@@ ding .
I was imagin@@ ing a &quot; Mar@@ ch of the Pen@@ gu@@ ins &quot; thing , so I looked at Mi@@ gu@@ el .
I said , &quot; Mi@@ gu@@ el , do they fly 1@@ 50 miles to the far@@ m , and then do they fly 1@@ 50 miles back at night ?
Do they do that for the children ? &quot;
He looked at me like I had just quot@@ ed a Wh@@ it@@ ney H@@ ou@@ st@@ on song .
He said , &quot; No ; they do it because the food &apos;s better . &quot;
I didn &apos;t men@@ tion the sk@@ in of my bel@@ ov@@ ed fish , which was del@@ ici@@ ous -- and I don &apos;t like fish sk@@ in ;
I don &apos;t like it se@@ ar@@ ed , I don &apos;t like it cri@@ sp@@ y .
It &apos;s that ac@@ ri@@ d , tar@@ -@@ like f@@ lav@@ or .
I almost never c@@ ook with it .
Y@@ et , when I tast@@ ed it at that res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ant in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n Sp@@ ain , it tast@@ ed not at all like fish sk@@ in .
It tast@@ ed s@@ we@@ et and cle@@ an , like you were taking a b@@ ite of the ocean .
I men@@ tion@@ ed that to Mi@@ gu@@ el , and he no@@ d@@ ded .
He said , &quot; The sk@@ in ac@@ ts like a sp@@ on@@ ge .
It &apos;s the last de@@ f@@ en@@ se before anything en@@ ters the body .
It evol@@ ved to so@@ ak up imp@@ ur@@ ities . &quot;
And then he ad@@ ded , &quot; But our water has no imp@@ ur@@ ities . &quot;
OK . A far@@ m that doesn &apos;t fe@@ ed its fish ,
a far@@ m that meas@@ u@@ res its succ@@ ess by the succ@@ ess of its pre@@ d@@ ators .
And then I realized when he says , &quot; A far@@ m that has no imp@@ ur@@ ities , &quot; he made a big underst@@ at@@ ement , because the water that flo@@ ws through that far@@ m comes in from the Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r R@@ iv@@ er . It &apos;s a riv@@ er that car@@ ri@@ es with it all the things that ri@@ ver@@ s tend to car@@ ry these days : chem@@ ical cont@@ amin@@ ants , pes@@ tic@@ ide run@@ off .
And when it works its way through the system and le@@ av@@ es , the water is cle@@ an@@ er than when it enter@@ ed .
The system is so heal@@ thy , it pu@@ ri@@ fi@@ es the water .
So , not just a far@@ m that doesn &apos;t fe@@ ed its animals , not just a far@@ m that meas@@ u@@ res its succ@@ ess by the health of its pre@@ d@@ ators , but a far@@ m that &apos;s literally a water pu@@ ri@@ fic@@ ation pl@@ ant -- and not just for those fish , but for you and me as well .
Because when that water le@@ av@@ es , it d@@ um@@ ps out into the At@@ lan@@ tic .
A dro@@ p in the ocean , I know , but I &apos;ll take it , and so should you , because this love story , h@@ ow@@ ever rom@@ anti@@ c , is also in@@ struc@@ tive .
You might say it &apos;s a re@@ ci@@ pe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about bas@@ s or be@@ ef c@@ att@@ le .
What we need now is a rad@@ ically new conc@@ ep@@ tion of agric@@ ul@@ ture , one in which the food actually tast@@ es good .
But for a lot people , that &apos;s a bit too rad@@ ical .
We &apos;re not real@@ ists , us f@@ oo@@ dies ;
we &apos;re lov@@ ers .
We love far@@ m@@ ers &apos; mark@@ ets ,
we love small family far@@ ms ,
we talk about local food ,
we eat organ@@ ic .
And when you sugg@@ est these are the things that will en@@ sure the future of good food , someone , some@@ where st@@ ands up and says , &quot; H@@ ey guy , I love p@@ ink fl@@ amin@@ go@@ s , but how are you going to fe@@ ed the world ? &quot;
How are you going to fe@@ ed the world ?
Can I be hon@@ est ?
I don &apos;t love that question .
No , not because we already produce enough cal@@ or@@ ies to more than fe@@ ed the world .
One billion people will go hun@@ gr@@ y today .
One billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of gros@@ s ine@@ qual@@ ities in distribu@@ tion , not ton@@ n@@ age .
Now , I don &apos;t love this question because it &apos;s determin@@ ed the log@@ ic of our food system for the last 50 years .
F@@ e@@ ed gr@@ ain to her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , pes@@ tic@@ ide@@ s to mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , chem@@ ic@@ als to so@@ il , ch@@ ick@@ en to fish , and all along ag@@ ri@@ business has simply asked , &quot; If we &apos;re fe@@ ed@@ ing more people more che@@ ap@@ ly , how terri@@ ble could that be ? &quot;
That &apos;s been the motiv@@ ation ,
it &apos;s been the ju@@ sti@@ fic@@ ation :
it &apos;s been the business pl@@ an of American agric@@ ul@@ ture .
We should call it what it is : a business in li@@ qu@@ id@@ ation , a business that &apos;s quickly ero@@ ding ec@@ olog@@ ical cap@@ ital that makes that very produc@@ tion possible .
That &apos;s not a business , and it isn &apos;t agric@@ ul@@ ture .
Our bre@@ ad@@ bas@@ ket is thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed today , not because of di@@ min@@ i@@ shing sup@@ ply , but because of di@@ min@@ i@@ shing resources . Not by the lat@@ est comb@@ ine and trac@@ tor inven@@ tion , but by fer@@ ti@@ le land ; not by p@@ um@@ ps , but by f@@ res@@ h water ; not by ch@@ ain@@ sa@@ ws , but by for@@ ests ; and not by fi@@ shing bo@@ ats and n@@ ets , but by fish in the sea .
W@@ ant to fe@@ ed the world ?
Let &apos;s start by asking : How are we going to fe@@ ed ourselves ?
Or better : How can we create cond@@ itions that en@@ able every community to fe@@ ed itself ?
To do that , don &apos;t look at the ag@@ ri@@ business model for the future .
It &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s ti@@ red .
It &apos;s high on cap@@ ital , ch@@ emis@@ try and mach@@ ines , and it &apos;s never produc@@ ed anything really good to eat .
In@@ ste@@ ad , let &apos;s look to the ec@@ olog@@ ical model .
That &apos;s the one that rel@@ ies on two billion years of on@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ job experience .
Look to Mi@@ gu@@ el , far@@ m@@ ers like Mi@@ gu@@ el . F@@ ar@@ ms that aren &apos;t worl@@ ds un@@ to themselves ; far@@ ms that res@@ t@@ ore instead of de@@ pl@@ ete ; far@@ ms that far@@ m ex@@ ten@@ si@@ vely instead of just inten@@ si@@ vely ; far@@ m@@ ers that are not just produc@@ ers , but ex@@ per@@ ts in relation@@ shi@@ ps . Because they &apos;re the ones that are ex@@ per@@ ts in f@@ lav@@ or , too .
And if I &apos;m going to be really hon@@ est , they &apos;re a better che@@ f than I &apos;ll ever be .
You know , I &apos;m o@@ kay with that , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;s going to be del@@ ici@@ ous .
Thank you .
I gre@@ w up on a ste@@ ad@@ y di@@ et of science fic@@ tion .
In high school , I took a bu@@ s to school an hour each way every day .
And I was always ab@@ sor@@ bed in a book , science fic@@ tion book , which took my mind to other worl@@ ds , and s@@ ati@@ sfi@@ ed , in a n@@ arr@@ ative form , this in@@ s@@ ati@@ able sense of curi@@ os@@ ity that I had .
And you know , that curi@@ os@@ ity also mani@@ f@@ ested itself in the fact that wh@@ en@@ ever I wasn &apos;t in school I was out in the w@@ oo@@ ds , hi@@ king and taking &quot; s@@ am@@ ples &quot; -- fr@@ og@@ s and s@@ n@@ a@@ kes and bu@@ gs and pon@@ d water -- and br@@ ing@@ ing it back , looking at it under the mic@@ ros@@ c@@ ope .
You know , I was a real science ge@@ e@@ k .
But it was all about trying to understand the world , understand the lim@@ its of possi@@ bility .
And my love of science fic@@ tion actually se@@ em@@ ed mir@@ r@@ or@@ ed in the world around me , because what was happening , this was in the late &apos; 6@@ 0s , we were going to the mo@@ on , we were explor@@ ing the deep oce@@ ans . J@@ acqu@@ es C@@ ou@@ ste@@ a@@ u was coming into our living ro@@ om@@ s with his amazing speci@@ als that showed us animals and places and a won@@ dr@@ ous world that we could never really have pre@@ vi@@ ously imagin@@ ed .
So , that se@@ em@@ ed to res@@ on@@ ate with the whole science fic@@ tion part of it .
And I was an arti@@ st .
I could dra@@ w . I could pa@@ int .
And I found that because there wer@@ en &apos;t video g@@ ames and this s@@ atur@@ ation of C@@ G mov@@ ies and all of this imag@@ ery in the media land@@ sc@@ ape , I had to create these images in my head .
You know , we all did , as kids having to read a book , and through the auth@@ or &apos;s descri@@ p@@ tion , put something on the movie scre@@ en in our head@@ s .
And so , my respon@@ se to this was to pa@@ int , to dra@@ w ali@@ en cre@@ atures , ali@@ en worl@@ ds , robot@@ s , sp@@ ac@@ es@@ hi@@ ps , all that stuff .
I was end@@ less@@ ly getting bu@@ st@@ ed in mat@@ h clas@@ s do@@ od@@ ling behind the t@@ ext@@ book .
That was -- the creati@@ vity had to find its out@@ let some@@ how .
And an interesting thing happened : The J@@ acqu@@ es C@@ ou@@ ste@@ a@@ u shows actually got me very exc@@ ited about the fact that there was an ali@@ en world right here on Earth .
I might not really go to an ali@@ en world on a sp@@ ac@@ es@@ hi@@ p som@@ ed@@ ay --
that se@@ em@@ ed pretty dar@@ n un@@ likely .
But that was a world I could really go to , right here on Earth , that was as r@@ ich and ex@@ ot@@ ic as anything that I had imagin@@ ed from reading these books .
So , I decided I was going to become a scu@@ ba di@@ v@@ er at the age of 15 .
And the only problem with that was that I lived in a little vill@@ age in C@@ an@@ ada , 6@@ 00 miles from the ne@@ ar@@ est ocean .
But I didn &apos;t let that d@@ a@@ un@@ t me .
I pes@@ ter@@ ed my father until he finally found a scu@@ ba clas@@ s in Bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , New York , right across the b@@ order from where we live .
And I actually got cer@@ ti@@ fied in a po@@ ol at a Y@@ M@@ CA in the dead of win@@ ter in Bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , New York .
And I didn &apos;t see the ocean , a real ocean , for another two years , until we moved to California .
S@@ in@@ ce then , in the inter@@ ven@@ ing 40 years , I &apos;ve spent about 3@@ ,000 hours under@@ water , and 500 hours of that was in sub@@ mer@@ si@@ bl@@ es .
And I &apos;ve learned that that de@@ ep@@ -@@ ocean environment , and even the sh@@ allow oce@@ ans , are so r@@ ich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagin@@ ation .
N@@ ature &apos;s imagin@@ ation is so b@@ ound@@ less compar@@ ed to our own me@@ ag@@ er human imagin@@ ation .
I still , to this day , stand in ab@@ sol@@ ute a@@ we of what I see when I make these di@@ ves .
And my love aff@@ air with the ocean is on@@ going , and just as strong as it ever was .
But when I ch@@ ose a car@@ e@@ er as an ad@@ ult , it was fil@@ m@@ making .
And that se@@ em@@ ed to be the best way to re@@ con@@ ci@@ le this ur@@ ge I had to tell stories with my ur@@ ges to create images .
And I was , as a kid , con@@ st@@ antly dra@@ wing com@@ ic books , and so on .
So , fil@@ m@@ making was the way to put pictures and stories
together , and that made sense .
And of course the stories that I ch@@ ose to tell were science fic@@ tion stories : &quot; T@@ er@@ min@@ ator , &quot; &quot; A@@ li@@ ens &quot; and &quot; The Ab@@ y@@ s@@ s . &quot;
And with &quot; The Ab@@ y@@ s@@ s , &quot; I was putting together my love of under@@ water and di@@ ving with fil@@ m@@ making .
So , you know , mer@@ ging the two pas@@ sions .
Some@@ thing interesting came out of &quot; The Ab@@ y@@ s@@ s , &quot; which was that to solve a speci@@ fic n@@ arr@@ ative problem on that film , which was to create this kind of li@@ qu@@ id water creature , we actually em@@ br@@ ac@@ ed computer gener@@ ated anim@@ ation , C@@ G .
And this res@@ ul@@ ted in the first sof@@ t-@@ surface charac@@ ter , C@@ G anim@@ ation that was ever in a movie .
And even though the film didn &apos;t make any money -- bar@@ ely bro@@ ke even , I should say -- I w@@ it@@ ness@@ ed something amazing , which is that the audience , the global audience , was m@@ es@@ mer@@ i@@ zed by this appar@@ ent mag@@ ic .
You know , it &apos;s Ar@@ th@@ ur C@@ lar@@ ke &apos;s law that any suff@@ ici@@ ently adv@@ anc@@ ed technology is indi@@ st@@ ingu@@ i@@ sh@@ able from mag@@ ic .
They were seeing something mag@@ ical .
And so that got me very exc@@ ited .
And I thought , &quot; W@@ ow , this is something that needs to be em@@ br@@ ac@@ ed into the cin@@ em@@ atic art . &quot;
So , with &quot; T@@ er@@ min@@ ator 2 , &quot; which was my next film , we took that much far@@ ther .
Wor@@ king with I@@ L@@ M , we created the li@@ qu@@ id met@@ al du@@ de in that film . The succ@@ ess hun@@ g in the bal@@ ance on whether that effect would work .
And it did , and we created mag@@ ic again ,
and we had the same result with an audience --
al@@ though we did make a little more money on that one .
So , dra@@ wing a line through those two d@@ ots of experience came to , &quot; This is going to be a whole new world , &quot; this was a whole new world of creati@@ vity for film arti@@ sts .
So , I started a company with St@@ an W@@ inst@@ on , my good friend St@@ an W@@ inst@@ on , who is the pre@@ mi@@ er ma@@ ke@@ -@@ up and creature designer at that time , and it was called D@@ ig@@ ital D@@ om@@ ain .
And the conc@@ ept of the company was that we would le@@ ap@@ f@@ ro@@ g past the anal@@ o@@ g process@@ es of op@@ tical pr@@ inter@@ s and so on , and we would go right to dig@@ ital produc@@ tion .
And we actually did that and it gave us a compet@@ itive adv@@ ant@@ age for a while .
But we found ourselves l@@ ag@@ ging in the mi@@ d &apos; 9@@ 0s in the creature and charac@@ ter design stuff that we had actually f@@ oun@@ ded the company to do .
So , I wrote this piece called &quot; Av@@ at@@ ar , &quot; which was me@@ ant to absolutely p@@ ush the en@@ vel@@ ope of visu@@ al eff@@ ects , of C@@ G eff@@ ects , beyond , with real@@ ist@@ ic human emoti@@ ve charac@@ ters gener@@ ated in C@@ G , and the main charac@@ ters would all be in C@@ G , and the world would be in C@@ G .
And the en@@ vel@@ ope p@@ ush@@ ed back ,
and I was told by the fol@@ ks at my company that we wer@@ en &apos;t going to be able to do this for a while .
So , I sh@@ el@@ ved it , and I made this other movie about a big ship that sin@@ ks .
You know , I went and p@@ it@@ ched it to the studio as &quot; &apos; R@@ ome@@ o and Ju@@ li@@ et &apos; on a ship :
&quot; It &apos;s going to be this epi@@ c rom@@ ance , pas@@ sion@@ ate film . &quot;
S@@ ec@@ ret@@ ly , what I wanted to do was I wanted to di@@ ve to the real w@@ rec@@ k of &quot; T@@ it@@ an@@ ic . &quot;
And that &apos;s why I made the movie .
And that &apos;s the truth . Now , the studio didn &apos;t know that .
But I conv@@ inc@@ ed them . I said , &quot; We &apos;re going to di@@ ve to the w@@ rec@@ k . We &apos;re going to film it for real .
We &apos;ll be using it in the open@@ ing of the film .
It will be really important . It will be a great mark@@ eting h@@ ook . &quot;
And I talked them into fun@@ ding an ex@@ ped@@ ition .
S@@ ounds cra@@ z@@ y . But this goes back to that th@@ eme about your imagin@@ ation creating a reality .
Because we actually created a reality where six months later , I find myself in a Rus@@ si@@ an sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble two and a half miles down in the nor@@ th At@@ lan@@ tic , looking at the real T@@ it@@ an@@ ic through a view port . Not a movie , not H@@ D -- for real .
Now , that b@@ le@@ w my mind .
And it took a lot of prepar@@ ation , we had to build cam@@ er@@ as and li@@ ghts and all kinds of things .
But , it struc@@ k me how much this di@@ ve , these deep di@@ ves , was like a space mission .
You know , where it was high@@ ly tech@@ n@@ ical , and it re@@ qui@@ red enorm@@ ous plan@@ ning .
You get in this cap@@ su@@ le , you go down to this dark h@@ os@@ ti@@ le environment where there is no hope of res@@ cu@@ e if you can &apos;t get back by yourself .
And I thought like , &quot; W@@ ow . I &apos;m like , living in a science fic@@ tion movie .
This is really cool . &quot;
And so , I really got b@@ itt@@ en by the bu@@ g of de@@ ep@@ -@@ ocean explor@@ ation .
Of course , the curi@@ os@@ ity , the science compon@@ ent of it --
it was everything . It was ad@@ vent@@ ure ,
it was curi@@ os@@ ity , it was imagin@@ ation .
And it was an experience that H@@ oll@@ y@@ wood couldn &apos;t give me .
Because , you know , I could imagine a creature and we could create a visu@@ al effect for it . But I couldn &apos;t imagine what I was seeing out that w@@ ind@@ ow .
As we did some of our sub@@ sequ@@ ent ex@@ ped@@ itions , I was seeing cre@@ atures at hy@@ dro@@ ther@@ m@@ al v@@ ents and sometimes things that I had never seen before , sometimes things that no one had seen before , that actually were not descri@@ bed by science at the time that we saw them and imag@@ ed them .
So , I was completely sm@@ itt@@ en by this , and had to do more .
And so , I actually made a kind of curi@@ ous deci@@ sion .
Af@@ ter the succ@@ ess of &quot; T@@ it@@ an@@ ic , &quot; I said , &quot; OK , I &apos;m going to par@@ k my day job as a H@@ oll@@ y@@ wood movie ma@@ ker , and I &apos;m going to go be a ful@@ l@@ -@@ time explor@@ er for a while . &quot;
And so , we started plan@@ ning these ex@@ ped@@ itions .
And we w@@ ound up going to the B@@ is@@ mar@@ k , and explor@@ ing it with robot@@ ic ve@@ h@@ ic@@ les .
We went back to the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic w@@ rec@@ k .
We took little bot@@ s that we had created that spo@@ ol@@ ed a fi@@ ber op@@ tic .
And the idea was to go in and do an inter@@ ior sur@@ v@@ ey of that ship , which had never been done .
No@@ body had ever looked inside the w@@ rec@@ k . They didn &apos;t have the means to do it , so we created technology to do it .
So , you know , here I am now , on the dec@@ k of T@@ it@@ an@@ ic , sitting in a sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble , and looking out at plan@@ ks that look much like this , where I knew that the b@@ and had play@@ ed .
And I &apos;m fl@@ ying a little robot@@ ic ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le through the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or of the ship .
When I say , &quot; I &apos;m oper@@ ating it , &quot; but my mind is in the ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le .
I felt like I was physic@@ ally present inside the shi@@ p@@ w@@ rec@@ k of T@@ it@@ an@@ ic .
And it was the most sur@@ real kind of de@@ j@@ a v@@ u experience I &apos;ve ever had , because I would know before I turned a cor@@ ner what was going to be there before the li@@ ghts of the ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le actually re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed it , because I had wal@@ ked the set for months when we were making the movie .
And the set was based as an ex@@ act re@@ pl@@ ica on the bl@@ u@@ e@@ pr@@ in@@ ts of the ship .
So , it was this absolutely re@@ mark@@ able experience .
And it really made me realize that the tele@@ pres@@ ence experience -- that you actually can have these robot@@ ic av@@ at@@ ars , then your consci@@ ous@@ ness is in@@ j@@ ected into the ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le , into this other form of exist@@ ence .
It was really , really quite prof@@ ound .
And it may be a little bit of a gli@@ m@@ p@@ se as to what might be happening some de@@ ca@@ des out as we start to have cy@@ bor@@ g bo@@ dies for explor@@ ation or for other means in many sort of post@@ -@@ human fut@@ u@@ res that I can imagine , as a science fic@@ tion f@@ an .
So , having done these ex@@ ped@@ itions , and really beginning to ap@@ preci@@ ate what was down there , such as at the deep ocean v@@ ents where we had these amazing , amazing animals --
they &apos;re basically ali@@ ens right here on Earth .
They live in an environment of chem@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ is .
They don &apos;t sur@@ vive on sun@@ li@@ gh@@ t-@@ based system the way we do .
And so , you &apos;re seeing animals that are living next to a 5@@ 0@@ 0-@@ degre@@ e-@@ C@@ enti@@ gr@@ ade water pl@@ um@@ es .
You think they can &apos;t possi@@ bly ex@@ ist .
At the same time I was getting very interested in space science as well -- again , it &apos;s the science fic@@ tion influ@@ ence , as a kid .
And I w@@ ound up getting involved with the space community , really involved with NA@@ SA , sitting on the NA@@ SA ad@@ vi@@ sor@@ y board , plan@@ ning ac@@ tual space mis@@ sions , going to Rus@@ sia , going through the pre@@ -@@ cos@@ mon@@ a@@ ut bi@@ om@@ ed@@ ical prot@@ oc@@ ols , and all these sor@@ ts of things , to actually go and fly to the intern@@ ational space st@@ ation with our 3@@ D camera systems .
And this was fas@@ cin@@ ating .
But what I w@@ ound up doing was br@@ ing@@ ing space scientists with us into the deep .
And taking them down so that they had access -- as@@ tro@@ biolog@@ ists , plan@@ et@@ ary scientists , people who were interested in these ex@@ tr@@ eme environ@@ ments -- taking them down to the v@@ ents , and l@@ etting them see , and take s@@ am@@ ples and test in@@ strum@@ ents , and so on .
So , here we were making docum@@ ent@@ ary fil@@ ms , but actually doing science , and actually doing space science .
I &apos;d completely clos@@ ed the loo@@ p between being the science fic@@ tion f@@ an , you know , as a kid , and doing this stuff for real .
And you know , along the way in this jour@@ ney of discover@@ y , I learned a lot .
I learned a lot about science . But I also learned a lot about lead@@ er@@ ship .
Now you think direc@@ tor has got to be a leader , leader of , cap@@ tain of the ship , and all that sort of thing .
I didn &apos;t really learn about lead@@ er@@ ship until I did these ex@@ ped@@ itions .
Because I had to , at a certain point , say , &quot; What am I doing out here ?
Why am I doing this ? What do I get out of it ? &quot;
We don &apos;t make money at these d@@ am@@ n shows .
We bar@@ ely break even . There is no f@@ ame in it .
People sort of think I went away between &quot; T@@ it@@ an@@ ic &quot; and &quot; Av@@ at@@ ar &quot; and was bu@@ ff@@ ing my n@@ ail@@ s some@@ place , sitting at the be@@ ach .
M@@ ade all these fil@@ ms , made all these docum@@ ent@@ ary fil@@ ms for a very lim@@ ited audience .
No f@@ ame , no gl@@ ory , no money . What are you doing ?
You &apos;re doing it for the t@@ ask itself , for the challenge -- and the ocean is the most chall@@ eng@@ ing environment there is -- for the th@@ ri@@ ll of discover@@ y , and for that stran@@ ge b@@ ond that happens when a small group of people form a ti@@ gh@@ tly k@@ n@@ it team .
Because we would do these things with 10 , 12 people , working for years at a time ,
sometimes at sea for two , three months at a time .
And in that b@@ ond , you realize that the most important thing is the res@@ p@@ ect that you have for them and that they have for you , that you &apos;ve done a t@@ ask that you can &apos;t explain to someone else .
When you come back to the sh@@ ore and you say , &quot; We had to do this , and the fi@@ ber op@@ tic , and the att@@ entu@@ ation , and the this and the that , all the technology of it , and the diffic@@ ul@@ ty , the human@@ -@@ performan@@ ce asp@@ ects of working at sea , &quot; you can &apos;t explain it to people . It &apos;s that thing that maybe cop@@ s have , or people in comb@@ at that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it .
Cre@@ ates a b@@ ond , cre@@ ates a b@@ ond of res@@ p@@ ect .
So , when I came back to make my next movie , which was &quot; Av@@ at@@ ar , &quot; I tried to app@@ ly that same princi@@ ple of lead@@ er@@ ship , which is that you res@@ p@@ ect your team , and you ear@@ n their res@@ p@@ ect in re@@ turn .
And it really changed the dy@@ nam@@ ic .
So , here I was again with a small team , in un@@ char@@ ted ter@@ rit@@ ory , doing &quot; Av@@ at@@ ar , &quot; coming up with new technology that didn &apos;t ex@@ ist before .
T@@ re@@ men@@ d@@ ously exciting .
T@@ re@@ men@@ d@@ ously chall@@ eng@@ ing .
And we became a family , over a f@@ our@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ half year period .
And it completely changed how I do mov@@ ies .
So , people have comm@@ ent@@ ed on how , &quot; Well , you know , you brought back the ocean organis@@ ms and put them on the planet of P@@ and@@ ora . &quot;
To me , it was more of a fundament@@ al way of doing business , the process itself , that changed as a result of that .
So , what can we syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ze out of all this ?
You know , what are the less@@ ons learned ?
Well , I think number one is curi@@ os@@ ity .
It &apos;s the most powerful thing you own .
I@@ mag@@ in@@ ation is a force that can actually mani@@ f@@ est a reality .
And the res@@ p@@ ect of your team is more important than all the la@@ ur@@ els in the world .
I have young fil@@ m@@ ma@@ kers come up to me and say , &quot; Gi@@ ve me some adv@@ ice for doing this . &quot;
And I say , &quot; Don &apos;t put limit@@ ations on yourself .
O@@ ther people will do that for you -- don &apos;t do it to yourself , don &apos;t be@@ t against yourself ,
and take ris@@ ks . &quot;
NA@@ SA has this ph@@ r@@ ase that they like : &quot; F@@ ail@@ ure is not an op@@ tion . &quot;
But fail@@ ure has to be an op@@ tion in art and in explor@@ ation , because it &apos;s a le@@ a@@ p of fa@@ ith .
And no important en@@ de@@ av@@ or that re@@ qui@@ red innov@@ ation was done without risk .
You have to be w@@ ill@@ ing to take those ris@@ ks .
So , that &apos;s the thought I would leave you with , is that in whatever you &apos;re doing , fail@@ ure is an op@@ tion , but fe@@ ar is not . Thank you .
If I can leave you with one big idea today , it &apos;s that the whole of the data in which we consu@@ me is gre@@ ater that the su@@ m of the parts , and instead of thinking about information over@@ lo@@ ad , what I &apos;d like you to think about is how we can use information so that patter@@ ns po@@ p and we can see tr@@ ends that would o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se be invisi@@ ble .
So what we &apos;re looking at right here is a ty@@ pic@@ al mor@@ tal@@ ity char@@ t organi@@ zed by age .
This t@@ ool that I &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
It &apos;s called P@@ iv@@ ot , and with P@@ iv@@ ot what I can do is I can cho@@ ose to fil@@ ter in one particular cause of de@@ a@@ ths -- say , acci@@ d@@ ents .
And , right away , I see there &apos;s a different pattern that emer@@ ges .
This is because , in the mi@@ d-@@ area here , people are at their most active , and over here they &apos;re at their most fr@@ ail .
We can step back out again and then re@@ organi@@ ze the data by cause of death , seeing that cir@@ cul@@ at@@ ory dise@@ ases and cancer are the us@@ ual sus@@ p@@ ects , but not for everyone .
If we go a@@ head and we fil@@ ter by age -- say 40 years or less -- we see that acci@@ d@@ ents are actually the gre@@ at@@ est cause that people have to be wor@@ ried about .
And if you dri@@ ll into that , it &apos;s espe@@ cially the case for men .
So you get the idea that vie@@ wing information , vie@@ wing data in this way , is a lot like sw@@ im@@ ming in a living information inf@@ o-@@ grap@@ hic .
And if we can do this for ra@@ w data , why not do it for cont@@ ent as well ?
So what we have right here is the c@@ over of every single S@@ port@@ s I@@ ll@@ ustr@@ ated ever produc@@ ed .
It &apos;s all here ; it &apos;s all on the web .
You can go back to your ro@@ om@@ s and try this after my talk .
W@@ ith P@@ iv@@ ot , you can dri@@ ll into a dec@@ ade .
You can dri@@ ll into a particular year .
You can j@@ ump right into a speci@@ fic issue .
So I &apos;m looking at this ; I see the a@@ th@@ let@@ es that have appe@@ ar@@ ed in this issue , the s@@ port@@ s .
I &apos;m a L@@ ance Ar@@ m@@ strong f@@ an , so I &apos;ll go a@@ head and I &apos;ll cl@@ ick on that , which re@@ ve@@ als , for me , all the is@@ sues in which L@@ ance Ar@@ m@@ strong &apos;s been a part of .
Now , if I want to just kind of take a pe@@ e@@ k at these , I might think , &quot; Well , what about taking a look at all of cy@@ cl@@ ing ? &quot;
So I can step back , and exp@@ and on that .
And I see Gre@@ g Le@@ Mon@@ d now .
And so you get the idea that when you n@@ av@@ ig@@ ate over information this way -- going n@@ ar@@ ro@@ wer , bro@@ ad@@ er , bac@@ king in , bac@@ king out -- you &apos;re not se@@ arch@@ ing , you &apos;re not bro@@ w@@ sing .
You &apos;re doing something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
It &apos;s in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
So I want to ex@@ tr@@ ap@@ ol@@ ate on this idea a bit with something that &apos;s a little bit cra@@ z@@ y .
What we &apos;re done here is we &apos;ve taken every single Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia p@@ age and we re@@ duc@@ ed it down to a little sum@@ mar@@ y . So the sum@@ mar@@ y consist@@ s of just a little sy@@ no@@ p@@ s@@ is and an ic@@ on to indic@@ ate the top@@ ical area that it comes from .
I &apos;m only showing the top 500 most pop@@ ular Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia pag@@ es right here .
But even in this lim@@ ited view , we can do a lot of things .
Right away , we get a sense of what are the top@@ ical dom@@ ains that are most pop@@ ular on Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia .
I &apos;m going to go a@@ head and sel@@ ect government .
Now , having sel@@ ected government , I can now see that the Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia cat@@ eg@@ or@@ ies that most frequ@@ ently cor@@ respon@@ d to that are Tim@@ e mag@@ az@@ ine People of the Y@@ e@@ ar .
So this is really important because this is an insi@@ ght that was not con@@ tain@@ ed within any one Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia p@@ age .
It &apos;s only possible to see that insi@@ ght when you step back and look at all of them .
L@@ oo@@ king at one of these particular sum@@ mar@@ ies , I can then dri@@ ll into the conc@@ ept of Tim@@ e mag@@ az@@ ine Per@@ son of the Y@@ e@@ ar ,
br@@ ing@@ ing up all of them .
So looking at these people , I can see that the maj@@ or@@ ity come from government ; some have come from natural sci@@ ences ; some , fe@@ wer still , have come from business --
there &apos;s my b@@ oss --
and one has come from music .
And inter@@ est@@ ingly enough , B@@ ono is also a TED Pri@@ ze w@@ inn@@ er .
So we can go , j@@ ump , and take a look at all the TED Pri@@ ze w@@ inn@@ ers .
So you see , we &apos;re n@@ av@@ ig@@ ating the web for the first time as if it &apos;s actually a web , not from pag@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ p@@ age , but at a high@@ er level of ab@@ str@@ action .
And so I want to show you one other thing that may cat@@ ch you a little bit by sur@@ pri@@ se .
I &apos;m just showing the New York Tim@@ es w@@ eb@@ site here .
So P@@ iv@@ ot , this applic@@ ation -- I don &apos;t want to call it a bro@@ w@@ s@@ er ; it &apos;s really not a bro@@ w@@ s@@ er , but you can view web pag@@ es with it -- and we bring that z@@ o@@ om@@ able technology to every single web p@@ age like this .
So I can step back , po@@ p right back into a speci@@ fic sec@@ tion . Now the reason why this is important is because , by vir@@ tu@@ e of just vie@@ wing web pag@@ es in this way , I can look at my entire bro@@ w@@ sing history in the ex@@ act same way .
So I can dri@@ ll into what I &apos;ve done over speci@@ fic time fr@@ ames .
Here , in fact , is the state of all the de@@ mo that I just gave .
And I can sort of re@@ play some stuff that I was looking at ear@@ li@@ er today .
And , if I want to step back and look at everything , I can sl@@ ice and dice my history , perhaps by my se@@ ar@@ ch history --
here , I was doing some ne@@ pot@@ ist@@ ic se@@ arch@@ ing , looking for B@@ ing , over here for Li@@ ve L@@ ab@@ s P@@ iv@@ ot .
And from these , I can dri@@ ll into the web p@@ age and just la@@ unch them again .
It &apos;s one met@@ ap@@ h@@ or re@@ pur@@ posed multi@@ ple times , and in each case it makes the whole gre@@ ater than the su@@ m of the parts with the data .
So right now , in this world , we think about data as being this cur@@ se .
We talk about the cur@@ se of information over@@ lo@@ ad .
We talk about dro@@ w@@ ning in data .
What if we can actually turn that up@@ side down and turn the web up@@ side down , so that instead of n@@ av@@ ig@@ ating from one thing to the next , we get used to the h@@ a@@ bit of being able to go from many things to many things , and then being able to see the patter@@ ns that were o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se hi@@ d@@ den ?
If we can do that , then instead of being tr@@ app@@ ed in data , we might actually ex@@ tr@@ act information .
And , instead of de@@ al@@ ing just with information , we can te@@ ase out knowledge .
And if we get the knowledge , then maybe even there &apos;s w@@ is@@ dom to be found .
So with that , I thank you .
Every@@ body tal@@ ks about happiness these days .
I had somebody coun@@ t the number of books with &quot; happiness &quot; in the tit@@ le publi@@ shed in the last five years and they gave up after about 40 , and there were many more .
There is a huge w@@ ave of interest in happiness , am@@ ong resear@@ ch@@ ers .
There is a lot of happiness co@@ ach@@ ing .
Every@@ body would like to make people hap@@ pi@@ er .
But in sp@@ ite of all this f@@ loo@@ d of work , there are several c@@ ogn@@ itive tr@@ ap@@ s that sort of make it almost im@@ possible to think str@@ ai@@ ght about happiness .
And my talk today will be mos@@ tly about these c@@ ogn@@ itive tr@@ ap@@ s .
This app@@ lies to l@@ ay@@ people thinking about their own happiness , and it app@@ lies to sch@@ ol@@ ars thinking about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re just as mess@@ ed up as anybody else is .
The first of these tr@@ ap@@ s is a rel@@ uc@@ t@@ ance to ad@@ m@@ it compl@@ ex@@ ity .
It turns out that the word &quot; happiness &quot; is just not a us@@ eful word any@@ more , because we app@@ ly it to too many different things .
I think there is one particular mean@@ ing to which we might res@@ tr@@ ic@@ t it , but by and large , this is something that we &apos;ll have to give up and we &apos;ll have to ad@@ op@@ t the more complic@@ ated view of what w@@ ell@@ -@@ being is .
The second tra@@ p is a con@@ fu@@ sion between experience and mem@@ ory ; basically , it &apos;s between being happy in your life , and being happy about your life or happy with your life .
And those are two very different conc@@ ep@@ ts , and they &apos;re both l@@ um@@ ped in the not@@ ion of happiness .
And the third is the foc@@ using il@@ lu@@ sion , and it &apos;s the un@@ fortun@@ ate fact that we can &apos;t think about any cir@@ c@@ um@@ st@@ ance that aff@@ ects w@@ ell@@ -@@ being without di@@ stor@@ ting its import@@ ance .
I mean , this is a real c@@ ogn@@ itive tra@@ p .
There &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
Now , I &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a questi@@ on@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ answer ses@@ sion after one of my lec@@ tures re@@ port@@ ed a story ,
and that was a story -- He said he &apos;d been list@@ ening to a sym@@ ph@@ ony , and it was absolutely gl@@ ori@@ ous music and at the very end of the recor@@ ding , there was a dre@@ ad@@ ful scre@@ e@@ ching sound .
And then he ad@@ ded , really quite emoti@@ on@@ ally , it ru@@ in@@ ed the whole experience .
But it h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t .
What it had ru@@ in@@ ed were the mem@@ or@@ ies of the experience .
He had had the experience .
He had had 20 minutes of gl@@ ori@@ ous music .
They coun@@ ted for nothing because he was left with a mem@@ ory ; the mem@@ ory was ru@@ in@@ ed , and the mem@@ ory was all that he had g@@ ott@@ en to keep .
What this is telling us , really , is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves .
There is an experi@@ enc@@ ing self , who lives in the present and knows the present , is cap@@ able of re@@ -@@ living the past , but basically it has only the present .
It &apos;s the experi@@ enc@@ ing self that the doc@@ tor appro@@ ach@@ es -- you know , when the doc@@ tor as@@ ks , &quot; D@@ oes it h@@ ur@@ t now when I tou@@ ch you here ? &quot;
And then there is a remem@@ ber@@ ing self , and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self is the one that ke@@ ep@@ s sc@@ ore , and main@@ ta@@ ins the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the doc@@ tor appro@@ ach@@ es in asking the question , &quot; How have you been feeling l@@ ately ? &quot;
or &quot; How was your tri@@ p to Al@@ ban@@ ia ? &quot; or something like that .
Th@@ ose are two very different ent@@ ities , the experi@@ enc@@ ing self and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , and getting con@@ f@@ used between them is part of the m@@ ess about the not@@ ion of happiness .
Now , the remem@@ ber@@ ing self is a stor@@ y@@ tel@@ ler .
And that really star@@ ts with a basic respon@@ se of our mem@@ or@@ ies -- it star@@ ts immedi@@ ately .
We don &apos;t only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
Our mem@@ ory tel@@ ls us stories , that is , what we get to keep from our experi@@ ences is a story .
And let me begin with one example .
This is an old study .
Th@@ ose are ac@@ tual pati@@ ents under@@ going a pa@@ in@@ ful proc@@ ed@@ ure .
I won &apos;t go into de@@ tail . It &apos;s no longer pa@@ in@@ ful these days , but it was pa@@ in@@ ful when this study was run in the 199@@ 0s .
They were asked to re@@ port on their p@@ ain every 60 secon@@ ds .
Here are two pati@@ ents ,
those are their recor@@ dings .
And you are asked , &quot; W@@ ho of them suff@@ ered more ? &quot;
And it &apos;s a very easy question .
C@@ lear@@ ly , P@@ ati@@ ent B suff@@ ered more --
his col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y was longer , and every minute of p@@ ain that P@@ ati@@ ent A had , P@@ ati@@ ent B had , and more .
But now there is another question : &quot; How much did these pati@@ ents think they suff@@ ered ? &quot;
And here is a sur@@ pri@@ se . The sur@@ pri@@ se is that P@@ ati@@ ent A had a much wor@@ se mem@@ ory of the col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y than P@@ ati@@ ent B@@ .
The stories of the col@@ on@@ os@@ copi@@ es were different , and because a very crit@@ ical part of the story is how it ends . And ne@@ i@@ ther of these stories is very inspi@@ r@@ ing or great -- but one of them is this dist@@ inc@@ t ... but one of them is dist@@ inc@@ tly wor@@ se than the other .
And the one that is wor@@ se is the one where p@@ ain was at its pe@@ ak at the very end ;
it &apos;s a bad story .
How do we know that ?
Because we asked these people after their col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y , and much later , too , &quot; How bad was the whole thing , in tot@@ al ? &quot;
And it was much wor@@ se for A than for B , in mem@@ ory .
Now this is a direc@@ t confl@@ ic@@ t between the experi@@ enc@@ ing self and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
F@@ rom the point of view of the experi@@ enc@@ ing self , c@@ lear@@ ly , B had a wor@@ se time .
Now , what you could do with P@@ ati@@ ent A , and we actually ran clin@@ ical experim@@ ents , and it has been done , and it does work -- you could actually ex@@ tend the col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y of P@@ ati@@ ent A by just ke@@ ep@@ ing the tu@@ be in without j@@ ig@@ g@@ ling it too much .
That will cause the patient to suff@@ er , but just a little and much less than before .
And if you do that for a couple of minutes , you have made the experi@@ enc@@ ing self of P@@ ati@@ ent A wor@@ se off , and you have the remem@@ ber@@ ing self of P@@ ati@@ ent A a lot better off , because now you have en@@ do@@ wed P@@ ati@@ ent A with a better story about his experience .
What defin@@ es a story ?
And that is true of the stories that mem@@ ory del@@ i@@ ver@@ s for us , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we make up . What defin@@ es a story are changes , signific@@ ant mom@@ ents and end@@ ings .
En@@ dings are very , very important and , in this case , the end@@ ing domin@@ ated .
Now , the experi@@ enc@@ ing self lives its life continu@@ ously .
It has mom@@ ents of experience , one after the other . And you can ask : What happens to these mom@@ ents ?
And the answer is really str@@ ai@@ gh@@ t@@ forward :
They are lost for@@ ever . I mean , most of the mom@@ ents of our life -- and I calc@@ ul@@ ated , you know , the psych@@ olog@@ ical present is said to be about three secon@@ ds long ; that means that , you know , in a life there are about 6@@ 00 million of them ; in a month , there are about 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 -- most of them don &apos;t leave a tr@@ ace .
M@@ ost of them are completely ig@@ nor@@ ed by the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
And yet , some@@ how you get the sense that they should coun@@ t , that what happens during these mom@@ ents of experience is our life .
It &apos;s the fin@@ ite resour@@ ce that we &apos;re spen@@ ding while we &apos;re on this ear@@ th .
And how to spend it would seem to be rel@@ ev@@ ant , but that is not the story that the remem@@ ber@@ ing self ke@@ ep@@ s for us .
So we have the remem@@ ber@@ ing self and the experi@@ enc@@ ing self , and they &apos;re really quite dist@@ inc@@ t .
The bigg@@ est difference between them is in the hand@@ ling of time .
F@@ rom the point of view of the experi@@ enc@@ ing self , if you have a v@@ ac@@ ation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the tw@@ o-@@ week v@@ ac@@ ation is tw@@ ice as good as the on@@ e-@@ week v@@ ac@@ ation .
That &apos;s not the way it works at all for the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
For the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , a tw@@ o-@@ week v@@ ac@@ ation is bar@@ ely better than the on@@ e-@@ week v@@ ac@@ ation because there are no new mem@@ or@@ ies ad@@ ded .
You have not changed the story .
And in this way , time is actually the crit@@ ical vari@@ able that dist@@ ingu@@ i@@ sh@@ es a remem@@ ber@@ ing self from an experi@@ enc@@ ing self ;
time has very little impact on the story .
Now , the remem@@ ber@@ ing self does more than remember and tell stories .
It is actually the one that makes deci@@ sions because , if you have a patient who has had , say , two col@@ on@@ os@@ copi@@ es with two different sur@@ ge@@ ons and is deci@@ ding which of them to cho@@ ose , then the one that cho@@ os@@ es is the one that has the mem@@ ory that is less bad , and that &apos;s the sur@@ ge@@ on that will be ch@@ os@@ en .
The experi@@ enc@@ ing self has no vo@@ ice in this choice .
We actually don &apos;t cho@@ ose between experi@@ ences , we cho@@ ose between mem@@ or@@ ies of experi@@ ences .
And even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future norm@@ ally as experi@@ ences .
We think of our future as an@@ tic@@ ip@@ ated mem@@ or@@ ies .
And basically you can look at this , you know , as a ty@@ ran@@ ny of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , and you can think of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self sort of d@@ rag@@ ging the experi@@ enc@@ ing self through experi@@ ences that the experi@@ enc@@ ing self doesn &apos;t need .
I have that sense that when we go on v@@ ac@@ ations this is very frequ@@ ently the case ; that is , we go on v@@ ac@@ ations , to a very large ext@@ ent , in the serv@@ ice of our remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
And this is a bit hard to ju@@ sti@@ fy I think .
I mean , how much do we consu@@ me our mem@@ or@@ ies ?
That is one of the ex@@ plan@@ ations that is given for the domin@@ ance of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
And when I think about that , I think about a v@@ ac@@ ation we had in An@@ tar@@ c@@ t@@ ica a few years ago , which was c@@ lear@@ ly the best v@@ ac@@ ation I &apos;ve ever had , and I think of it relati@@ vely often , rel@@ ative to how much I think of other v@@ ac@@ ations .
And I probably have consum@@ ed my mem@@ or@@ ies of that thre@@ e-@@ week tri@@ p , I would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
Now , if I had ever open@@ ed the fol@@ der with the 6@@ 00 pictures in it , I would have spent another hour . Now , that is three weeks , and that is at most an hour and a half . There seems to be a disc@@ re@@ pan@@ c@@ y .
Now , I may be a bit ex@@ tr@@ eme , you know , in how little app@@ et@@ ite I have for consum@@ ing mem@@ or@@ ies , but even if you do more of this , there is a gen@@ u@@ ine question :
Why do we put so much we@@ ight on mem@@ ory rel@@ ative to the we@@ ight that we put on experi@@ ences ?
So I want you to think about a thought experiment .
I@@ mag@@ ine that for your next v@@ ac@@ ation , you know that at the end of the v@@ ac@@ ation all your pictures will be des@@ tro@@ y@@ ed , and you &apos;ll get an am@@ n@@ es@@ ic dru@@ g so that you won &apos;t remember anything .
Now , would you cho@@ ose the same v@@ ac@@ ation ? And if you would cho@@ ose a different v@@ ac@@ ation , there is a confl@@ ic@@ t between your two selves , and you need to think about how to ad@@ ju@@ dic@@ ate that confl@@ ic@@ t , and it &apos;s actually not at all obvi@@ ous , because if you think in terms of time , then you get one answer ,
and if you think in terms of mem@@ or@@ ies , you might get another answer .
Why do we pic@@ k the v@@ ac@@ ations we do is a problem that con@@ fron@@ ts us with a choice between the two selves .
Now , the two selves bring up two not@@ i@@ ons of happiness .
There are really two conc@@ ep@@ ts of happiness that we can app@@ ly , one per self .
So you can ask : How happy is the experi@@ enc@@ ing self ?
And then you would ask : How happy are the mom@@ ents in the experi@@ enc@@ ing self &apos;s life ?
And they &apos;re all -- happiness for mom@@ ents is a f@@ air@@ ly complic@@ ated process .
What are the emoti@@ ons that can be meas@@ u@@ red ?
And , by the way , now we are cap@@ able of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experi@@ enc@@ ing self over time .
If you ask for the happiness of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , it &apos;s a completely different thing .
This is not about how hap@@ pi@@ ly a person lives .
It is about how s@@ ati@@ sfi@@ ed or pl@@ eas@@ ed the person is when that person thin@@ ks about her life .
V@@ ery different not@@ ion .
An@@ y@@ one who doesn &apos;t dist@@ ingu@@ ish those not@@ i@@ ons is going to m@@ ess up the study of happiness , and I bel@@ ong to a cro@@ w@@ d of students of w@@ ell@@ -@@ being , who &apos;ve been mess@@ ing up the study of happiness for a long time in preci@@ sel@@ y this way .
The dist@@ inc@@ tion between the happiness of the experi@@ enc@@ ing self and the s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self has been recogni@@ zed in rec@@ ent years , and there are now ef@@ for@@ ts to meas@@ ure the two separ@@ ately . The G@@ all@@ up Or@@ gan@@ i@@ zation has a world pol@@ l where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experi@@ ences ,
and there have been other ef@@ for@@ ts along those lines .
So in rec@@ ent years , we have beg@@ un to learn about the happiness of the two selves .
And the main less@@ on I think that we have learned is they are really different .
You can know how s@@ ati@@ sfi@@ ed somebody is with their life , and that really doesn &apos;t teach you much about how hap@@ pi@@ ly they &apos;re living their life , and v@@ ice ver@@ sa .
Just to give you a sense of the cor@@ rel@@ ation , the cor@@ rel@@ ation is about .@@ 5 .
What that means is if you met somebody , and you were told , &quot; Oh his father is six feet t@@ all , &quot; how much would you know about his he@@ ight ?
Well , you would know something about his he@@ ight , but there &apos;s a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty .
You have that much un@@ certain@@ ty .
If I tell you that somebody ran@@ ked their life eight on a scale of ten , you have a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty about how happy they are with their experi@@ enc@@ ing self .
So the cor@@ rel@@ ation is low .
We know something about what contr@@ ols s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion of the happiness self .
We know that money is very important , go@@ als are very important .
We know that happiness is main@@ ly being s@@ ati@@ sfi@@ ed with people that we like , spen@@ ding time with people that we like .
There are other pl@@ eas@@ u@@ res , but this is domin@@ ant .
So if you want to ma@@ x@@ im@@ i@@ ze the happiness of the two selves , you are going to end up doing very different things .
The bottom line of what I &apos;ve said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a sub@@ st@@ itu@@ te for w@@ ell@@ -@@ being .
It is a completely different not@@ ion .
Now , very quickly , another reason we cannot think str@@ ai@@ ght about happiness is that we do not atten@@ d to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live .
So , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California , you are not going to get to the cor@@ rec@@ t answer .
When you ask that question , you think people must be hap@@ pi@@ er in California if , say , you live in O@@ h@@ io .
And what happens is when you think about living in California , you are thinking of the contr@@ ast between California and other places , and that contr@@ ast , say , is in climate .
Well , it turns out that climate is not very important to the experi@@ enc@@ ing self and it &apos;s not even very important to the re@@ fl@@ ective self that deci@@ des how happy people are .
But now , because the re@@ fl@@ ective self is in char@@ ge , you may end up -- some people may end up moving to California .
And it &apos;s sort of interesting to tr@@ ace what is going to happen to people who move to California in the hope of getting hap@@ pi@@ er .
Well , their experi@@ enc@@ ing self is not going to get hap@@ pi@@ er .
We know that .
But one thing will happen : They will think they are hap@@ pi@@ er , because , when they think about it , they &apos;ll be re@@ min@@ ded of how hor@@ ri@@ ble the we@@ a@@ ther was in O@@ h@@ io ,
and they will feel they made the right deci@@ sion .
It is very difficult to think str@@ ai@@ ght about w@@ ell@@ -@@ being , and I hope I have given you a sense of how difficult it is .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you . I &apos;ve got a question for you .
Thank you so much .
Now , when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you men@@ tion@@ ed to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that G@@ all@@ up sur@@ v@@ ey .
Is that something you can share since you do have a few mom@@ ents left now ?
D@@ an@@ i@@ el K@@ ah@@ nem@@ an : S@@ ure .
I think the most interesting result that we found in the G@@ all@@ up sur@@ v@@ ey is a number , which we absolutely did not exp@@ ect to find .
We found that with res@@ p@@ ect to the happiness of the experi@@ enc@@ ing self .
When we looked at how fe@@ el@@ ings , v@@ ary with in@@ come . And it turns out that , bel@@ ow an in@@ come of 6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , for Americ@@ ans -- and that &apos;s a very large s@@ am@@ ple of Americ@@ ans , like 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 , so it &apos;s a large re@@ present@@ ative s@@ am@@ ple -- bel@@ ow an in@@ come of 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 dollars a year ...
CA : 6@@ 0,000 . D@@ K : 6@@ 0,000 . 6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , people are un@@ happy , and they get progres@@ si@@ vely un@@ hap@@ pi@@ er the po@@ or@@ er they get . Ab@@ ove that , we get an absolutely fl@@ at line .
I mean I &apos;ve r@@ ar@@ ely seen lines so fl@@ at .
C@@ lear@@ ly , what is happening is money does not buy you experi@@ ential happiness , but l@@ ack of money certainly bu@@ ys you mi@@ ser@@ y , and we can meas@@ ure that mi@@ ser@@ y very , very c@@ lear@@ ly .
In terms of the other self , the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , you get a different story .
The more money you ear@@ n , the more s@@ ati@@ sfi@@ ed you are .
That does not hold for emoti@@ ons .
CA : But D@@ ann@@ y , the whole American en@@ de@@ av@@ or is about life , liber@@ ty , the pur@@ su@@ it of happiness .
If people took seri@@ ously that fin@@ ding , I mean , it seems to turn up@@ side down everything we believe about , like for example , ta@@ x@@ ation polic@@ y and so for@@ th .
Is there any chance that polit@@ ici@@ ans , that the country gener@@ ally , would take a fin@@ ding like that seri@@ ously and run public polic@@ y based on it ?
D@@ K : You know I think that there is rec@@ ogn@@ ition of the r@@ ole of happiness research in public polic@@ y .
The rec@@ ogn@@ ition is going to be s@@ low in the United States , no question about that , but in the U.@@ K@@ . , it is happening , and in other countries it is happening .
People are recogni@@ zing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public polic@@ y .
It &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to deb@@ ate whether they want to study experience happiness , or whether they want to study life ev@@ al@@ u@@ ation , so we need to have that deb@@ ate f@@ air@@ ly soon .
How to en@@ h@@ ance happiness goes very different ways de@@ pen@@ ding on how you think , and whether you think of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self or you think of the experi@@ enc@@ ing self .
This is going to influ@@ ence polic@@ y , I think , in years to come .
In the United States , ef@@ for@@ ts are being made to meas@@ ure the experience happiness of the population .
This is going to be , I think , within the next dec@@ ade or two , part of national statist@@ ics .
CA : Well , it seems to me that this issue will -- or at least should be -- the most interesting polic@@ y discus@@ sion to tr@@ ack over the next few years .
Thank you so much for invent@@ ing behav@@ i@@ or@@ al econom@@ ics .
Thank you , D@@ ann@@ y K@@ ah@@ nem@@ an .
I &apos;m going to talk today about energy and climate .
And that might seem a bit surpris@@ ing because my ful@@ l@@ -@@ time work at the F@@ ound@@ ation is mos@@ tly about vacc@@ ines and se@@ eds , about the things that we need to inv@@ ent and del@@ iv@@ er to help the po@@ or@@ est two billion live better lives .
But energy and climate are ex@@ trem@@ ely important to these people -- in fact , more important than to anyone else on the planet .
The climate getting wor@@ se means that many years , their cr@@ ops won &apos;t grow :
There will be too much ra@@ in , not enough ra@@ in ,
things will change in ways that their fr@@ ag@@ ile environment simply can &apos;t support .
And that lead@@ s to star@@ v@@ ation , it lead@@ s to un@@ certain@@ ty , it lead@@ s to un@@ rest .
So , the climate changes will be terri@@ ble for them .
Al@@ so , the price of energy is very important to them .
In fact , if you could pic@@ k just one thing to lo@@ wer the price of , to re@@ duce poverty , by far you would pic@@ k energy .
Now , the price of energy has come down over time .
Re@@ ally adv@@ anc@@ ed civi@@ li@@ zation is based on adv@@ ances in energy .
The co@@ al revol@@ ution fu@@ el@@ ed the In@@ d@@ us@@ tri@@ al R@@ evolution ,
and , even in the 19@@ 0@@ 0s we &apos;ve seen a very rap@@ id de@@ cl@@ ine in the price of electr@@ icity , and that &apos;s why we have re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , air@@ -@@ cond@@ iti@@ on@@ ing , we can make moder@@ n materials and do so many things .
And so , we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electr@@ icity in the r@@ ich world .
But , as we make it che@@ ap@@ er -- and let &apos;s go for making it tw@@ ice as ch@@ ea@@ p -- we need to meet a new con@@ str@@ ain@@ t , and that con@@ str@@ ain@@ t has to do with CO2 .
CO2 is war@@ ming the planet , and the equ@@ ation on CO2 is actually a very str@@ ai@@ gh@@ t@@ forward one .
If you su@@ m up the CO2 that gets em@@ itt@@ ed , that lead@@ s to a temper@@ ature incre@@ ase , and that temper@@ ature incre@@ ase lead@@ s to some very neg@@ ative eff@@ ects :
the eff@@ ects on the we@@ a@@ ther ; perhaps wor@@ se , the indi@@ rec@@ t eff@@ ects , in that the natural ec@@ os@@ y@@ st@@ ems can &apos;t ad@@ just to these rap@@ id changes , and so you get ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem coll@@ ap@@ ses .
Now , the ex@@ act amount of how you map from a certain incre@@ ase of CO2 to what temper@@ ature will be and where the positive fe@@ ed@@ bac@@ ks are , there &apos;s some un@@ certain@@ ty there , but not very much .
And there &apos;s certainly un@@ certain@@ ty about how bad those eff@@ ects will be , but they will be ex@@ trem@@ ely bad .
I asked the top scientists on this several times : Do we really have to get down to ne@@ ar zero ?
Can &apos;t we just cut it in half or a quar@@ ter ?
And the answer is that until we get ne@@ ar to zero , the temper@@ ature will continu@@ e to ri@@ se .
And so that &apos;s a big challenge .
It &apos;s very different than saying &quot; We &apos;re a tw@@ el@@ ve@@ -@@ fo@@ ot@@ -@@ high truc@@ k trying to get under a ten@@ -@@ f@@ oot bri@@ dge ,
and we can just sort of squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze under . &quot;
This is something that has to get to zero .
Now , we put out a lot of carbon di@@ ox@@ ide every year , over 2@@ 6 billion t@@ ons .
For each American , it &apos;s about 20 t@@ ons ;
for people in poor countries , it &apos;s less than one ton .
It &apos;s an average of about five t@@ ons for everyone on the planet .
And , some@@ how , we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero .
It &apos;s been con@@ st@@ antly going up .
It &apos;s only vari@@ ous economic changes that have even fl@@ atten@@ ed it at all , so we have to go from rapid@@ ly ris@@ ing to f@@ all@@ ing , and f@@ all@@ ing all the way to zero .
This equ@@ ation has four fac@@ tors ,
a little bit of multi@@ plic@@ ation :
So , you &apos;ve got a thing on the left , CO2 , that you want to get to zero , and that &apos;s going to be based on the number of people , the serv@@ ices each person &apos;s using on average , the energy on average for each serv@@ ice , and the CO2 being put out per un@@ it of energy .
So , let &apos;s look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero .
Pro@@ b@@ ably , one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty ne@@ ar to zero .
Now that &apos;s back from high school al@@ ge@@ bra ,
but let &apos;s take a look .
F@@ irst , we &apos;ve got population .
The world today has 6@@ .@@ 8 billion people .
That &apos;s he@@ a@@ ded up to about n@@ ine billion .
Now , if we do a really great job on new vacc@@ ines , health care , re@@ produc@@ tive health serv@@ ices , we could lo@@ wer that by , perhaps , 10 or 15 percent , but there we see an incre@@ ase of about 1@@ .@@ 3 .
The second fac@@ tor is the serv@@ ices we use .
This en@@ comp@@ ass@@ es everything : the food we eat , c@@ lo@@ thing , TV , he@@ ating .
These are very good things : getting ri@@ d of poverty means prov@@ id@@ ing these serv@@ ices to almost everyone on the planet .
And it &apos;s a great thing for this number to go up .
In the r@@ ich world , perhaps the top one billion , we probably could cut back and use less , but every year , this number , on average , is going to go up ,
and so , over all , that will more than d@@ ouble the serv@@ ices del@@ i@@ ver@@ ed per person .
Here we have a very basic serv@@ ice :
Do you have li@@ gh@@ ting in your house to be able to read your h@@ ome@@ work ? And , in fact , these kids don &apos;t , so they &apos;re going out and reading their school work under the stre@@ et l@@ am@@ ps .
Now , effici@@ ency , E , the energy for each serv@@ ice , here finally we have some good news .
We have something that &apos;s not going up .
Th@@ r@@ ough vari@@ ous inven@@ tions and new ways of doing li@@ gh@@ ting , through different ty@@ pes of cars , different ways of building buil@@ dings -- there are a lot of serv@@ ices where you can bring the energy for that serv@@ ice down quite sub@@ st@@ anti@@ ally .
Some individual serv@@ ices even bring it down by 90 percent .
There are other serv@@ ices like how we make fer@@ ti@@ li@@ z@@ er , or how we do air trans@@ port , where the ro@@ om@@ s for improv@@ ement are far , far less .
And so , over@@ all here , if we &apos;re op@@ ti@@ mist@@ ic , we may get a re@@ duc@@ tion of a fac@@ tor of three to even , perhaps , a fac@@ tor of six .
But for these first three fac@@ tors now , we &apos;ve gone from 2@@ 6 billion to , at best , maybe 1@@ 3 billion t@@ ons ,
and that just won &apos;t cut it .
So let &apos;s look at this f@@ our@@ th fac@@ tor -- this is going to be a key one -- and this is the amount of CO2 put out per each un@@ it of energy .
And so the question is : Can you actually get that to zero ?
If you bur@@ n co@@ al , no .
If you bur@@ n natural gas , no .
Al@@ most every way we make electr@@ icity today , exc@@ ept for the emer@@ ging ren@@ e@@ w@@ ab@@ les and nuclear , p@@ uts out CO2 .
And so , what we &apos;re going to have to do at a global scale , is create a new system .
And so , we need energy mi@@ rac@@ les .
Now , when I use the term &quot; mi@@ rac@@ le , &quot; I don &apos;t mean something that &apos;s im@@ possible .
The micro@@ process@@ or is a mi@@ rac@@ le . The personal computer is a mi@@ rac@@ le .
The Internet and its serv@@ ices are a mi@@ rac@@ le .
So , the people here have partic@@ ip@@ ated in the cre@@ ation of many mi@@ rac@@ les .
U@@ su@@ ally , we don &apos;t have a de@@ ad@@ line , where you have to get the mi@@ rac@@ le by a certain date .
U@@ su@@ ally , you just kind of stand by , and some come along , some don &apos;t .
This is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a mi@@ rac@@ le in a pretty ti@@ ght tim@@ el@@ ine .
Now , I thought , &quot; How could I really cap@@ ture this ?
Is there some kind of natural ill@@ ustr@@ ation , some de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation that would gra@@ b people &apos;s imagin@@ ation here ? &quot;
I thought back to a year ago when I brought mos@@ qu@@ it@@ os , and some@@ how people en@@ jo@@ y@@ ed that .
It really got them involved in the idea of , you know , there are people who live with mos@@ qu@@ it@@ os .
So , with energy , all I could come up with is this .
I decided that rel@@ eas@@ ing fi@@ re@@ f@@ lies would be my contribu@@ tion to the environment here this year .
So here we have some natural fi@@ re@@ f@@ lies .
I &apos;m told they don &apos;t b@@ ite ; in fact , they might not even leave that j@@ ar .
Now , there &apos;s all sor@@ ts of g@@ im@@ m@@ ick@@ y solu@@ tions like that one , but they don &apos;t really add up to much .
We need solu@@ tions -- either one or several -- that have un@@ believ@@ able scale and un@@ believ@@ able rel@@ i@@ ability , and , al@@ though there &apos;s many direc@@ tions people are see@@ king , I really only see five that can achi@@ eve the big numbers .
I &apos;ve left out ti@@ de , ge@@ o@@ ther@@ m@@ al , fu@@ sion , bio@@ fu@@ els .
Th@@ ose may make some contribu@@ tion , and if they can do better than I exp@@ ect , so much the better , but my key point here is that we &apos;re going to have to work on each of these five , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they look d@@ a@@ un@@ ting , because they all have signific@@ ant chall@@ eng@@ es .
Let &apos;s look first at the bur@@ ning fos@@ si@@ l fu@@ els , either bur@@ ning co@@ al or bur@@ ning natural gas .
What you need to do there , seems like it might be simple , but it &apos;s not , and that &apos;s to take all the CO2 , after you &apos;ve bur@@ ned it , going out the flu@@ e , pres@@ su@@ ri@@ ze it , create a li@@ qu@@ id , put it some@@ where , and hope it st@@ ays there .
Now we have some pi@@ lot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level , but getting up to that full perc@@ ent@@ age , that will be very tr@@ ick@@ y , and ag@@ re@@ e@@ ing on where these CO2 quant@@ ities should be put will be hard ,
but the tou@@ gh@@ est one here is this long@@ -@@ term issue .
W@@ ho &apos;s going to be sure ?
W@@ ho &apos;s going to guar@@ an@@ te@@ e something that is literally bil@@ lions of times larg@@ er than any type of w@@ aste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things ?
This is a lot of vol@@ ume .
So that &apos;s a t@@ ough one .
N@@ ext would be nuclear .
It also has three big problems :
Cos@@ t , partic@@ ularly in high@@ ly reg@@ ul@@ ated countries , is high ;
the issue of the s@@ af@@ ety , really feeling good about nothing could go wrong , that , even though you have these human oper@@ ators , that the fu@@ el doesn &apos;t get used for we@@ ap@@ ons .
And then what do you do with the w@@ aste ?
And , al@@ though it &apos;s not very large , there are a lot of concer@@ ns about that .
People need to feel good about it .
So three very t@@ ough problems that might be sol@@ v@@ able , and so , should be worked on .
The last three of the five , I &apos;ve grou@@ ped together .
These are what people often re@@ f@@ er to as the ren@@ e@@ w@@ able sour@@ ces .
And they actually -- al@@ though it &apos;s great they don &apos;t re@@ qu@@ ire fu@@ el -- they have some dis@@ adv@@ ant@@ ages .
One is that the den@@ s@@ ity of energy ga@@ ther@@ ed in these technologies is d@@ ram@@ at@@ ically less than a power pl@@ ant .
This is energy far@@ ming , so you &apos;re talking about many squ@@ are miles , thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy pl@@ ant .
Al@@ so , these are inter@@ m@@ itt@@ ent sour@@ ces .
The s@@ un doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine all day , it doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine every day , and , li@@ ke@@ wi@@ se , the wind doesn &apos;t b@@ low all the time .
And so , if you de@@ pen@@ d on these sour@@ ces , you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time peri@@ o@@ ds that it &apos;s not available .
So , we &apos;ve got big cost chall@@ eng@@ es here ,
we have trans@@ mission chall@@ eng@@ es :
for example , say this energy source is outside your country ;
you not only need the technology , but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from el@@ se@@ where .
And , finally , this stor@@ age problem .
And , to dimen@@ sion@@ ali@@ ze this , I went through and looked at all the ty@@ pes of batter@@ ies that get made -- for cars , for computers , for ph@@ ones , for f@@ las@@ h@@ li@@ ghts , for everything -- and compar@@ ed that to the amount of electr@@ ical energy the world uses , and what I found is that all the batter@@ ies we make now could st@@ ore less than 10 minutes of all the energy .
And so , in fact , we need a big bre@@ ak@@ through here , something that &apos;s going to be a fac@@ tor of 100 better than the appro@@ ach@@ es we have now .
It &apos;s not im@@ possible , but it &apos;s not a very easy thing .
Now , this shows up when you try to get the inter@@ m@@ itt@@ ent source to be ab@@ ove , say , 20 to 30 percent of what you &apos;re using .
If you &apos;re coun@@ ting on it for 100 percent , you need an incredible mi@@ rac@@ le batter@@ y .
Now , how we &apos;re going to go forward on this -- what &apos;s the right approach ?
Is it a Man@@ h@@ att@@ an Pro@@ ject ? What &apos;s the thing that can get us there ?
Well , we need lots of companies working on this , hundreds .
In each of these five pa@@ ths , we need at least a hundre@@ d people .
And a lot of them , you &apos;ll look at and say , &quot; They &apos;re cra@@ z@@ y . &quot; That &apos;s good .
And , I think , here in the TED group , we have many people who are already pur@@ su@@ ing this .
Bill Gr@@ oss has several companies , inclu@@ ding one called e@@ S@@ ol@@ ar that has some great solar ther@@ m@@ al technologies .
V@@ in@@ od K@@ h@@ os@@ la &apos;s inv@@ esting in do@@ z@@ ens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possi@@ bil@@ ities , and I &apos;m trying to help back that .
N@@ a@@ than M@@ y@@ h@@ r@@ vol@@ d and I actually are bac@@ king a company that , perhaps surpris@@ ingly , is actually taking the nuclear approach .
There are some innov@@ ations in nuclear : mo@@ d@@ ular , li@@ qu@@ id .
And innov@@ ation really st@@ op@@ ped in this industry quite some ago , so the idea that there &apos;s some good ideas l@@ aying around is not all that surpris@@ ing .
The idea of T@@ er@@ ra@@ Po@@ wer is that , instead of bur@@ ning a part of ur@@ an@@ i@@ um -- the one percent , which is the U@@ 2@@ 3@@ 5 -- we decided , &quot; Let &apos;s bur@@ n the 9@@ 9 percent , the U@@ 2@@ 3@@ 8 . &quot; It is kind of a cra@@ z@@ y idea .
In fact , people had talked about it for a long time , but they could never simul@@ ate proper@@ ly whether it would work or not , and so it &apos;s through the adv@@ ent of moder@@ n super@@ computers that now you can simul@@ ate and see that , yes , with the right material &apos;s approach , this looks like it would work .
And , because you &apos;re bur@@ ning that 9@@ 9 percent , you have gre@@ at@@ ly improv@@ ed cost pro@@ fi@@ le .
You actually bur@@ n up the w@@ aste , and you can actually use as fu@@ el all the le@@ f@@ t@@ over w@@ aste from today &apos;s re@@ ac@@ tors . So , instead of wor@@ r@@ ying about them , you just take that . It &apos;s a great thing .
It brea@@ th@@ es this ur@@ an@@ i@@ um as it goes along , so it &apos;s kind of like a c@@ and@@ le .
You can see it &apos;s a lo@@ g there , often re@@ fer@@ red to as a trav@@ eling w@@ ave re@@ ac@@ tor .
In terms of fu@@ el , this really sol@@ ves the problem .
I &apos;ve got a picture here of a place in K@@ ent@@ uc@@ ky .
This is the le@@ f@@ t@@ over , the 9@@ 9 percent , where they &apos;ve taken out the part they bur@@ n now , so it &apos;s called de@@ pl@@ et@@ ed ur@@ an@@ i@@ um .
That would power the U.S. for hundreds of years .
And , simply by fil@@ ter@@ ing se@@ a@@ water in an in@@ ex@@ pen@@ sive process , you &apos;d have enough fu@@ el for the entire li@@ fe@@ time of the rest of the planet .
So , you know , it &apos;s got lots of chall@@ eng@@ es a@@ head , but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward .
So let &apos;s think : How should we meas@@ ure ourselves ?
What should our re@@ port car@@ d look like ?
Well , let &apos;s go out to where we really need to get , and then look at the inter@@ medi@@ ate .
For 20@@ 50 , you &apos;ve heard many people talk about this 80 percent re@@ duc@@ tion . That really is very important , that we get there .
And that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries , still some agric@@ ul@@ ture ,
hop@@ ef@@ ully we will have cle@@ an@@ ed up for@@ es@@ try , c@@ ement .
So , to get to that 80 percent , the developed countries , inclu@@ ding countries like China , will have had to sw@@ it@@ ch their electr@@ icity generation al@@ together .
So , the other gr@@ ade is : A@@ re we de@@ plo@@ ying this z@@ er@@ o-@@ emis@@ sion technology ,
have we de@@ plo@@ y@@ ed it in all the developed countries
and we &apos;re in the process of getting it el@@ se@@ where ?
That &apos;s su@@ per important .
That &apos;s a key el@@ ement of making that re@@ port car@@ d .
So , bac@@ king up from there , what should the 20@@ 20 re@@ port car@@ d look like ?
Well , again , it should have the two elem@@ ents .
We should go through these effici@@ ency meas@@ u@@ res to start getting re@@ duc@@ tions :
The less we em@@ it , the less that su@@ m will be of CO2 , and , ther@@ e@@ fore , the less the temper@@ ature .
But in some ways , the gr@@ ade we get there , doing things that don &apos;t get us all the way to the big re@@ duc@@ tions , is only equ@@ ally , or maybe even sli@@ gh@@ tly less , important than the other , which is the piece of innov@@ ation on these bre@@ ak@@ thr@@ ough@@ s .
These bre@@ ak@@ thr@@ ough@@ s , we need to move those at full speed , and we can meas@@ ure that in terms of companies , pi@@ lot projects , reg@@ ul@@ at@@ ory things that have been changed .
There &apos;s a lot of great books that have been wr@@ itt@@ en about this .
The Al G@@ ore book , &quot; Our Ch@@ o@@ ice &quot; and the David Mc@@ K@@ ay book , &quot; Su@@ st@@ ain@@ able En@@ er@@ g@@ y Wi@@ th@@ out the H@@ ot A@@ ir . &quot;
They really go through it and create a fr@@ am@@ e@@ work that this can be discus@@ s@@ ed bro@@ ad@@ ly , because we need bro@@ ad bac@@ king for this .
There &apos;s a lot that has to come together .
So this is a wish .
It &apos;s a very con@@ cre@@ te wish that we inv@@ ent this technology .
If you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years -- I could pic@@ k who &apos;s presid@@ ent , I could pic@@ k a vacc@@ ine , which is something I love , or I could pic@@ k that this thing that &apos;s half the cost with no CO2 gets invent@@ ed -- this is the wish I would pic@@ k .
This is the one with the gre@@ at@@ est impact .
If we don &apos;t get this wish , the divi@@ sion between the people who think short term and long term will be terri@@ ble , between the U.S. and China , between poor countries and r@@ ich , and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far wor@@ se .
So , what do we have to do ?
What am I appe@@ al@@ ing to you to step forward and drive ?
We need to go for more research fun@@ ding .
When countries get together in places like C@@ open@@ h@@ ag@@ en , they sh@@ ouldn &apos;t just discus@@ s the CO2 .
They should discus@@ s this innov@@ ation ag@@ en@@ da , and you &apos;d be st@@ un@@ ned at the ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ously low lev@@ els of spen@@ ding on these innov@@ ative appro@@ ach@@ es .
We do need the market inc@@ enti@@ ves -- CO2 ta@@ x , ca@@ p and tr@@ ade -- something that gets that price sign@@ al out there .
We need to get the mess@@ age out .
We need to have this di@@ al@@ og@@ ue be a more r@@ ational , more underst@@ and@@ able di@@ al@@ og@@ ue , inclu@@ ding the ste@@ ps that the government takes .
This is an important wish , but it is one I think we can achi@@ eve .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you . So to understand more about T@@ er@@ ra@@ Po@@ wer , right --
I mean , first of all , can you give a sense of what scale of invest@@ ment this is ?
B@@ il G@@ ates : To actually do the software , buy the super@@ computer , h@@ ire all the great scientists , which we &apos;ve done , that &apos;s only ten@@ s of millions , and even once we test our materials out in a Rus@@ si@@ an re@@ ac@@ tor to make sure that our materials work proper@@ ly , then you &apos;ll only be up in the hundreds of millions .
The t@@ ough thing is building the pi@@ lot re@@ ac@@ tor ; fin@@ ding the several billion , fin@@ ding the reg@@ ul@@ ator , the loc@@ ation that will actually build the first one of these .
O@@ n@@ ce you get the first one built , if it works as ad@@ ver@@ tis@@ ed , then it &apos;s just clear as day , because the econom@@ ics , the energy den@@ s@@ ity , are so different than nuclear as we know it .
CA : And so , to understand it right , this invol@@ ves building deep into the ground almost like a ver@@ tical kind of col@@ um@@ n of nuclear fu@@ el , of this sort of spent ur@@ an@@ i@@ um ,
and then the process star@@ ts at the top and kind of works down ?
B@@ G : That &apos;s right . To@@ day , you &apos;re always re@@ fu@@ eling the re@@ ac@@ tor , so you have lots of people and lots of contr@@ ols that can go wrong : that thing where you &apos;re open@@ ing it up and moving things in and out ,
that &apos;s not good .
So , if you have very ch@@ ea@@ p fu@@ el that you can put 60 years in -- just think of it as a lo@@ g -- put it down and not have those same compl@@ ex@@ ities .
And it just s@@ its there and bur@@ ns for the 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
CA : It &apos;s a nuclear power pl@@ ant that is its own w@@ aste dis@@ pos@@ al solution .
B@@ G : Yeah . Well , what happens with the w@@ aste , you can let it sit there -- there &apos;s a lot less w@@ aste under this approach -- then you can actually take that , and put it into another one and bur@@ n that .
And we start off actually by taking the w@@ aste that ex@@ ists today , that &apos;s sitting in these co@@ ol@@ ing po@@ ols or d@@ ry cas@@ king by re@@ ac@@ tors --
that &apos;s our fu@@ el to begin with .
So , the thing that &apos;s been a problem from those re@@ ac@@ tors is actually what gets f@@ ed into ours , and you &apos;re re@@ duc@@ ing the vol@@ ume of the w@@ aste quite d@@ ram@@ at@@ ically as you &apos;re going through this process .
CA : I mean , you &apos;re talking to different people around the world about the possi@@ bil@@ ities here . Where is there most interest in actually doing something with this ?
B@@ G : Well , we haven &apos;t pic@@ ked a particular place , and there &apos;s all these interesting disc@@ l@@ os@@ ure rules about anything that &apos;s called &quot; nuclear , &quot; so we &apos;ve got a lot of interest ,
that people from the company have been in Rus@@ sia , India , China --
I &apos;ve been back seeing the sec@@ ret@@ ary of energy here ,
talking about how this f@@ its into the energy ag@@ en@@ da .
So I &apos;m op@@ ti@@ mist@@ ic . You know , the F@@ ren@@ ch and Jap@@ an@@ ese have done some work .
This is a vari@@ ant on something that has been done .
It &apos;s an important adv@@ ance , but it &apos;s like a fast re@@ ac@@ tor , and a lot of countries have built them , so anybody who &apos;s done a fast re@@ ac@@ tor is a can@@ di@@ date to be where the first one gets built .
CA : So , in your mind , tim@@ esc@@ ale and lik@@ el@@ i@@ hood of actually taking something like this live ?
B@@ G : Well , we need -- for one of these high-@@ scale , elec@@ tro@@ -@@ generation things that &apos;s very ch@@ ea@@ p , we have 20 years to inv@@ ent and then 20 years to de@@ plo@@ y .
That &apos;s sort of the de@@ ad@@ line that the environ@@ mental model@@ s have sho@@ wn us that we have to meet .
And , you know , T@@ er@@ ra@@ Po@@ wer , if things go well -- which is wi@@ shing for a lot -- could easi@@ ly meet that .
And there are , fortun@@ ately now , do@@ z@@ ens of companies -- we need it to be hundreds -- who , li@@ ke@@ wi@@ se , if their science goes well , if the fun@@ ding for their pi@@ lot plants goes well , that they can com@@ pe@@ te for this .
And it &apos;s best if multi@@ ple succ@@ e@@ ed , because then you could use a mi@@ x of these things .
We certainly need one to succ@@ e@@ ed .
CA : In terms of bi@@ g@@ -@@ scale possible game changes , is this the bigg@@ est that you &apos;re aw@@ are of out there ?
B@@ G : A@@ n energy bre@@ ak@@ through is the most important thing .
It would have been , even without the environ@@ mental con@@ str@@ ain@@ t , but the environ@@ mental con@@ str@@ ain@@ t just makes it so much gre@@ ater .
In the nuclear space , there are other innov@@ ators .
You know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as we know this one , but the mo@@ d@@ ular people , that &apos;s a different approach .
There &apos;s a li@@ qu@@ id@@ -@@ type re@@ ac@@ tor , which seems a little hard , but maybe they say that about us .
And so , there are different ones , but the be@@ aut@@ y of this is a molec@@ u@@ le of ur@@ an@@ i@@ um has a million times as much energy as a molec@@ u@@ le of , say , co@@ al , and so -- if you can deal with the neg@@ ati@@ ves , which are ess@@ entially the radi@@ ation -- the fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int and cost , the pot@@ ential , in terms of effect on land and vari@@ ous things , is almost in a clas@@ s of its own .
CA : If this doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
Do we have to start taking emer@@ gen@@ c@@ y meas@@ u@@ res to try and keep the temper@@ ature of the ear@@ th st@@ able ?
B@@ G : If you get into that situation , it &apos;s like if you &apos;ve been over@@ -@@ e@@ ating , and you &apos;re about to have a heart att@@ ack :
Then where do you go ? You may need heart sur@@ ger@@ y or something .
There is a line of research on what &apos;s called ge@@ o@@ engine@@ ering , which are vari@@ ous tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es that would del@@ ay the he@@ ating to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together .
Now , that &apos;s just an in@@ sur@@ ance polic@@ y .
You hope you don &apos;t need to do that .
Some people say you sh@@ ouldn &apos;t even work on the in@@ sur@@ ance polic@@ y because it might make you la@@ z@@ y , that you &apos;ll keep e@@ ating because you know heart sur@@ ger@@ y will be there to save you .
I &apos;m not sure that &apos;s wi@@ se , given the import@@ ance of the problem , but there &apos;s now the ge@@ o@@ engine@@ ering discus@@ sion about -- should that be in the back p@@ ock@@ et in case things happen f@@ aster , or this innov@@ ation goes a lot s@@ lo@@ wer than we exp@@ ect ?
CA : C@@ lim@@ ate sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ s : If you had a sent@@ ence or two to say to them , how might you per@@ su@@ ade them that they &apos;re wrong ?
B@@ G : Well , un@@ fortun@@ ately , the sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ s come in different cam@@ ps . The ones who make scientific arg@@ um@@ ents are very few .
A@@ re they saying that there &apos;s neg@@ ative fe@@ ed@@ back eff@@ ects that have to do with cl@@ ou@@ ds that off@@ set things ?
There are very , very few things that they can even say there &apos;s a chance in a million of those things . The main problem we have here , it &apos;s kind of like AIDS .
You make the mi@@ sta@@ ke now , and you pay for it a lot later .
And so , when you have all sor@@ ts of ur@@ g@@ ent problems , the idea of taking p@@ ain now that has to do with a g@@ ain later ,
and a some@@ what un@@ certain p@@ ain thing --
in fact , the I@@ P@@ C@@ C re@@ port , that &apos;s not necessari@@ ly the wor@@ st case , and there are people in the r@@ ich world who look at I@@ P@@ C@@ C and say , &quot; OK , that isn &apos;t that big of a deal . &quot;
The fact is it &apos;s that un@@ certain part that should move us towards this .
But my dre@@ am here is that , if you can make it economic , and meet the CO2 con@@ str@@ ain@@ ts , then the sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ s say , &quot; OK , I don &apos;t care that it doesn &apos;t put out CO2 , I kind of wish it did put out CO2 , but I guess I &apos;ll acc@@ ept it because it &apos;s che@@ ap@@ er than what &apos;s come before . &quot;
CA : And so , that would be your respon@@ se to the B@@ j@@ or@@ n L@@ om@@ bor@@ g arg@@ um@@ ent , that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the CO2 problem , it &apos;s going to take away all your other go@@ als of trying to ri@@ d the world of poverty and malaria and so for@@ th , it &apos;s a stupi@@ d w@@ aste of the Earth &apos;s resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do .
B@@ G : Well , the ac@@ tual spen@@ ding on the R &@@ amp@@ ; am@@ p ; D piece --
say the U.S. should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now -- it &apos;s not that d@@ ram@@ atic .
It sh@@ ouldn &apos;t take away from other things .
The thing you get into big money on , and this , reas@@ on@@ able people can dis@@ ag@@ ree , is when you have something that &apos;s non-@@ economic and you &apos;re trying to fun@@ d that --
that , to me , mos@@ tly is a w@@ aste .
Un@@ less you &apos;re very close and you &apos;re just fun@@ ding the learning cur@@ ve and it &apos;s going to get very ch@@ ea@@ p , I believe we should try more things that have a pot@@ ential to be far less ex@@ pen@@ sive .
If the tra@@ de@@ -@@ off you get into is , &quot; Let &apos;s make energy su@@ per ex@@ pen@@ sive , &quot; then the r@@ ich can af@@ ford that . I mean , all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our li@@ f@@ est@@ y@@ le .
The dis@@ aster is for that two billion .
And even L@@ om@@ bor@@ g has changed .
H@@ is sh@@ tic@@ k now is , &quot; Why isn &apos;t the R &@@ amp@@ ; am@@ p ; D getting more discus@@ s@@ ed ? &quot;
He &apos;s still , because of his ear@@ li@@ er stuff , still associ@@ ated with the sk@@ ep@@ tic cam@@ p , but he &apos;s realized that &apos;s a pretty l@@ on@@ ely cam@@ p , and so , he &apos;s making the R &@@ amp@@ ; am@@ p ; D point .
And so there is a th@@ read of something that I think is ap@@ propri@@ ate .
The R &@@ amp@@ ; am@@ p ; D piece , it &apos;s cra@@ z@@ y how little it &apos;s fun@@ ded .
CA : Well Bill , I sus@@ p@@ ect I speak on the be@@ half of most people here to say I really hope your wish comes true . Thank you so much .
B@@ G : Thank you .
I &apos;d like to share with you a discover@@ y that I made a few months ago while writ@@ ing an artic@@ le for I@@ t@@ ali@@ an Wi@@ red .
I always keep my th@@ es@@ a@@ ur@@ us hand@@ y wh@@ en@@ ever I &apos;m writ@@ ing anything , but I &apos;d already fin@@ i@@ shed ed@@ iting the piece , and I realized that I had never once in my life looked up the word &quot; dis@@ ab@@ led &quot; to see what I &apos;d find .
Let me read you the entr@@ y .
&quot; Dis@@ ab@@ led , ad@@ j@@ ective : cri@@ p@@ pl@@ ed , hel@@ pl@@ ess , us@@ eless , w@@ rec@@ ked , st@@ all@@ ed , ma@@ im@@ ed , w@@ oun@@ ded , man@@ gl@@ ed , l@@ ame , mu@@ til@@ ated , run@@ -@@ down , wor@@ n@@ -@@ out , we@@ ak@@ en@@ ed , im@@ pot@@ ent , cas@@ tr@@ ated , par@@ al@@ y@@ zed , hand@@ ic@@ app@@ ed , sen@@ ile , de@@ cre@@ p@@ it , l@@ ai@@ d-@@ up , don@@ e-@@ up , don@@ e-@@ for , don@@ e-@@ in cr@@ ack@@ ed@@ -@@ up , coun@@ t@@ ed@@ -@@ out ; see also h@@ ur@@ t , us@@ eless and we@@ ak .
An@@ ton@@ y@@ ms , heal@@ thy , strong , cap@@ able . &quot;
I was reading this li@@ st out l@@ ou@@ d to a friend and at first was lau@@ gh@@ ing , it was so lu@@ dic@@ r@@ ous , but I &apos;d just g@@ ott@@ en past &quot; man@@ gl@@ ed , &quot; and my vo@@ ice bro@@ ke , and I had to stop and coll@@ ect myself from the emoti@@ onal sh@@ ock and impact that the ass@@ a@@ ult from these words un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed .
You know , of course , this is my rag@@ g@@ ed@@ y old th@@ es@@ a@@ ur@@ us
so I &apos;m thinking this must be an anci@@ ent pr@@ int date , right ?
But , in fact , the pr@@ int date was the early 198@@ 0s ,
when I would have been starting prim@@ ary school and form@@ ing an understanding of myself outside the family un@@ it and as rel@@ ated to the other kids and the world around me .
And , ne@@ ed@@ less to say , thank God I wasn &apos;t using a th@@ es@@ a@@ ur@@ us back then .
I mean , from this entr@@ y , it would seem that I was born into a world that perc@@ e@@ iv@@ ed someone like me to have nothing positive what@@ so@@ ever going for them , when in fact , today I &apos;m celebr@@ ated for the opportun@@ ities and ad@@ vent@@ u@@ res my life has pro@@ cu@@ red .
So , I immedi@@ ately went to look up the 200@@ 9 online ed@@ ition , exp@@ ec@@ ting to find a re@@ vision worth not@@ ing .
Here &apos;s the up@@ d@@ ated version of this entr@@ y .
Un@@ fortun@@ ately , it &apos;s not much better .
I find the last two words under &quot; Ne@@ ar An@@ ton@@ y@@ ms , &quot; partic@@ ularly un@@ sett@@ ling : &quot; whole &quot; and &quot; wh@@ ol@@ es@@ ome . &quot; So , it &apos;s not just about the words .
It &apos;s what we believe about people when we name them with these words .
It &apos;s about the val@@ ues behind the words , and how we construc@@ t those val@@ ues .
Our language aff@@ ects our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people .
In fact , many anci@@ ent soci@@ eti@@ es , inclu@@ ding the Gre@@ e@@ ks and the R@@ om@@ ans , believ@@ ed that to ut@@ ter a cur@@ se ver@@ b@@ ally was so powerful , because to say the thing out l@@ ou@@ d brought it into exist@@ ence .
So , what reality do we want to call into exist@@ ence : a person who is lim@@ ited , or a person who &apos;s em@@ power@@ ed ?
By cas@@ ually doing something as simple as nam@@ ing a person , a child , we might be putting li@@ ds and c@@ ast@@ ing sh@@ ad@@ o@@ ws on their power .
W@@ ouldn &apos;t we want to open do@@ ors for them instead ?
One such person who open@@ ed do@@ ors for me was my chil@@ d@@ hood doc@@ tor at the A@@ .@@ I@@ . du@@ P@@ on@@ t In@@ st@@ itu@@ te in Wil@@ m@@ ington , D@@ el@@ aw@@ are .
H@@ is name was D@@ r. Pi@@ zz@@ uti@@ l@@ lo ,
an I@@ t@@ ali@@ an American , wh@@ ose name , appar@@ ently , was too difficult for most Americ@@ ans to pron@@ oun@@ ce , so he went by D@@ r. P@@ .
And D@@ r. P always w@@ ore really col@@ or@@ ful b@@ ow ti@@ es and had the very perfect dis@@ pos@@ ition to work with children .
I lov@@ ed almost everything about my time spent at this hosp@@ ital , with the exc@@ ep@@ tion of my physical ther@@ ap@@ y s@@ essi@@ ons .
I had to do what se@@ em@@ ed like in@@ num@@ er@@ able re@@ pet@@ itions of ex@@ erci@@ ses with these th@@ ick , el@@ ast@@ ic b@@ ands -- different col@@ ors , you know -- to help build up my le@@ g mus@@ c@@ les ,
and I h@@ ated these b@@ ands more than anything --
I h@@ ated them , had nam@@ es for them . I h@@ ated them .
And , you know , I was already bar@@ g@@ ain@@ ing , as a five year-old child , with D@@ r. P to try to get out of doing these ex@@ erci@@ ses , un@@ success@@ fully , of course .
And , one day , he came in to my ses@@ sion -- ex@@ h@@ au@@ sti@@ ve and un@@ for@@ giving , these s@@ essi@@ ons --
and he said to me , &quot; W@@ ow . A@@ im@@ ee , you are such a strong and powerful little girl , I think you &apos;re going to break one of those b@@ ands .
When you do break it , I &apos;m going to give you a hundre@@ d buc@@ ks . &quot;
Now , of course , this was a simple plo@@ y on D@@ r. P &apos;s part to get me to do the ex@@ erci@@ ses I didn &apos;t want to do before the pros@@ p@@ ect of being the ri@@ ch@@ est fi@@ ve@@ -@@ year-old in the second flo@@ or ward , but what he eff@@ ec@@ ti@@ vely did for me was res@@ hap@@ e an aw@@ ful d@@ ai@@ ly oc@@ curr@@ ence
into a new and prom@@ is@@ ing experience for me .
And I have to won@@ der today to what ext@@ ent his vision and his dec@@ lar@@ ation of me as a strong and powerful little girl sh@@ ap@@ ed my own view of myself as an in@@ her@@ ently strong , powerful and a@@ th@@ le@@ tic person well into the future .
This is an example of how adul@@ ts in positi@@ ons of power can ig@@ n@@ ite the power of a child .
But , in the pre@@ vi@@ ous inst@@ ances of those th@@ es@@ a@@ ur@@ us entr@@ ies , our language isn &apos;t al@@ lowing us to evol@@ ve into the reality that we would all want , the possi@@ bility of an individual to see themselves as cap@@ able .
Our language h@@ as@@ n &apos;t c@@ au@@ ght up with the changes in our society , many of which have been brought about by technology .
Cer@@ tain@@ ly , from a medic@@ al stand@@ point , my leg@@ s , las@@ er sur@@ ger@@ y for vision imp@@ air@@ ment , tit@@ an@@ i@@ um k@@ ne@@ es and hi@@ p re@@ plac@@ em@@ ents for aging bo@@ dies that are al@@ lowing people to more fully eng@@ age with their abil@@ ities , and move beyond the lim@@ its that nature has im@@ posed on them -- not to men@@ tion social net@@ working pl@@ at@@ forms allow people to self-@@ identi@@ fy , to cl@@ ai@@ m their own descri@@ p@@ tions of themselves , so they can go al@@ ig@@ n with global grou@@ ps of their own cho@@ os@@ ing .
So , perhaps technology is re@@ ve@@ al@@ ing more c@@ lear@@ ly to us now what has always been a truth : that everyone has something r@@ are and powerful to off@@ er our society , and that the human ability to ad@@ ap@@ t is our gre@@ at@@ est as@@ set .
The human ability to ad@@ ap@@ t , it &apos;s an interesting thing , because people have continu@@ ally wanted to talk to me about over@@ coming ad@@ vers@@ ity , and I &apos;m going to make an ad@@ mission :
This ph@@ r@@ ase never s@@ at right with me , and I always felt un@@ easy trying to answer people &apos;s questions about it , and I think I &apos;m starting to figure out why .
Im@@ plic@@ it in this ph@@ r@@ ase of &quot; over@@ coming ad@@ vers@@ ity &quot; is the idea that succ@@ ess , or happiness , is about emer@@ ging on the other side of a chall@@ eng@@ ing experience un@@ sc@@ a@@ th@@ ed or un@@ mar@@ ked by the experience , as if my success@@ es in life have come about from an ability to si@@ des@@ te@@ p or cir@@ c@@ um@@ n@@ av@@ ig@@ ate the pres@@ um@@ ed p@@ it@@ f@@ alls of a life with pros@@ th@@ et@@ ics , or what other people perc@@ ei@@ ve as my dis@@ ability .
But , in fact , we are changed . We are mar@@ ked , of course , by a challenge , whether physic@@ ally , emoti@@ on@@ ally or both .
And I &apos;m going to sugg@@ est that this is a good thing .
Ad@@ vers@@ ity isn &apos;t an ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le that we need to get around in order to res@@ ume living our life .
It &apos;s part of our life .
And I tend to think of it like my sh@@ ad@@ ow .
Some@@ times I see a lot of it , sometimes there &apos;s very little , but it &apos;s always with me .
And , certainly , I &apos;m not trying to di@@ min@@ ish the impact , the we@@ ight , of a person &apos;s str@@ ugg@@ le .
There is ad@@ vers@@ ity and challenge in life , and it &apos;s all very real and rel@@ ative to every single person , but the question isn &apos;t whether or not you &apos;re going to meet ad@@ vers@@ ity , but how you &apos;re going to meet it .
So , our responsi@@ bility is not simply shi@@ el@@ ding those we care for from ad@@ vers@@ ity , but prepar@@ ing them to meet it well .
And we do a dis@@ serv@@ ice to our kids when we make them feel that they &apos;re not equ@@ ip@@ ped to ad@@ ap@@ t .
There &apos;s an important difference and dist@@ inc@@ tion between the ob@@ j@@ ective medic@@ al fact of my being an amp@@ ut@@ ee and the sub@@ j@@ ective soci@@ et@@ al opini@@ on of whether or not I &apos;m dis@@ ab@@ led .
And , tru@@ th@@ fully , the only real and consist@@ ent dis@@ ability I &apos;ve had to con@@ front is the world ever thinking that I could be descri@@ bed by those defin@@ itions .
In our des@@ ire to prot@@ ect those we care about by giving them the col@@ d , hard truth about their medic@@ al prog@@ n@@ os@@ is , or , inde@@ ed , a prog@@ n@@ os@@ is on the exp@@ ected quality of their life , we have to make sure that we don &apos;t put the first br@@ ick in a wall that will actually dis@@ able someone .
Per@@ haps the exist@@ ing model of only looking at what is bro@@ ken in you and how do we fi@@ x it , ser@@ ves to be more dis@@ ab@@ ling to the individual than the pa@@ th@@ ology itself .
By not tre@@ ating the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess of a person , by not ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ging their pot@@ ency , we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural str@@ ugg@@ le they might have .
We are eff@@ ec@@ ti@@ vely grad@@ ing someone &apos;s worth to our community .
So we need to see through the pa@@ th@@ ology and into the ran@@ ge of human cap@@ ability .
And , most import@@ antly , there &apos;s a part@@ ner@@ ship between those perc@@ e@@ iv@@ ed de@@ fici@@ en@@ ci@@ es and our gre@@ at@@ est creative ability .
So it &apos;s not about de@@ val@@ u@@ ing , or neg@@ ating , these more trying times as something we want to av@@ o@@ id or s@@ we@@ ep under the ru@@ g , but instead to find those opportun@@ ities w@@ rap@@ ped in the ad@@ vers@@ ity .
So maybe the idea I want to put out there is not so much over@@ coming ad@@ vers@@ ity as it is open@@ ing ourselves up to it , em@@ br@@ ac@@ ing it , grap@@ pl@@ ing with it , to use a w@@ res@@ t@@ ling term , maybe even d@@ anc@@ ing with it .
And , perhaps , if we see ad@@ vers@@ ity as natural , consist@@ ent and us@@ eful , we &apos;re less bur@@ den@@ ed by the pres@@ ence of it .
This year we celebr@@ ate the 200@@ th bir@@ th@@ day of Charles Dar@@ win , and it was 1@@ 50 years ago , when writ@@ ing about evolution , that Dar@@ win ill@@ ustr@@ ated , I think , a truth about the human charac@@ ter .
To par@@ ap@@ h@@ r@@ ase : It &apos;s not the str@@ ong@@ est of the species that sur@@ vi@@ ves , n@@ or is it the most intelli@@ g@@ ent that sur@@ vi@@ ves ; it is the one that is most ad@@ ap@@ table to change .
Con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t is the gen@@ es@@ is of cre@@ ation .
F@@ rom Dar@@ win &apos;s work , am@@ ong@@ st others , we can recogni@@ ze that the human ability to sur@@ vive and fl@@ ou@@ ris@@ h is driv@@ en by the str@@ ugg@@ le of the human spiri@@ t through confl@@ ic@@ t into transform@@ ation .
So , again , transform@@ ation , ad@@ ap@@ t@@ ation , is our gre@@ at@@ est human sk@@ ill .
And , perhaps , until we &apos;re tes@@ ted , we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re made of .
May@@ be that &apos;s what ad@@ vers@@ ity gives us : a sense of self , a sense of our own power .
So , we can give ourselves a gi@@ ft .
We can re@@ -@@ imagine ad@@ vers@@ ity as something more than just t@@ ough times .
May@@ be we can see it as change .
Ad@@ vers@@ ity is just change that we haven &apos;t ad@@ ap@@ ted ourselves to yet .
I think the gre@@ at@@ est ad@@ vers@@ ity that we &apos;ve created for ourselves is this idea of norm@@ alc@@ y . Now , who &apos;s normal ?
There &apos;s no normal . There &apos;s common , there &apos;s ty@@ pic@@ al . There &apos;s no normal ,
and would you want to meet that poor , be@@ ig@@ e person if they exist@@ ed ?
I don &apos;t think so .
If we can change this para@@ dig@@ m from one of achi@@ ev@@ ing norm@@ alc@@ y to one of possi@@ bility -- or pot@@ ency , to be even a little bit more dang@@ er@@ ous -- we can rel@@ ease the power of so many more children , and inv@@ ite them to eng@@ age their r@@ are and val@@ u@@ able abil@@ ities with the community .
An@@ thr@@ op@@ olog@@ ists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always re@@ qui@@ red of our community mem@@ bers is to be of use , to be able to contribu@@ te .
There &apos;s evid@@ ence that Ne@@ and@@ er@@ th@@ als , 6@@ 0,000 years ago , car@@ ried their el@@ der@@ ly and those with seri@@ ous physical in@@ j@@ ury , and perhaps it &apos;s because the life experience of sur@@ viv@@ al of these people prov@@ ed of value to the community . They didn &apos;t view these people as bro@@ ken and us@@ eless ; they were seen as r@@ are and val@@ u@@ able .
A few years ago , I was in a food market in the town where I gre@@ w up in that red zone in nor@@ the@@ ast@@ er@@ n Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania ,
and I was st@@ anding over a bus@@ h@@ el of tom@@ at@@ oes .
It was sum@@ mer@@ time : I had shor@@ ts on .
I hear this guy , his vo@@ ice behind me say , &quot; Well , if it isn &apos;t A@@ im@@ ee M@@ ul@@ lin@@ s . &quot; And I turn around , and it &apos;s this ol@@ der man . I have no idea who he is .
And I said , &quot; I &apos;m sor@@ ry , si@@ r , have we met ? I don &apos;t remember me@@ eting you . &quot; He said , &quot; Well , you wouldn &apos;t remember me@@ eting me .
I mean , when we met I was del@@ i@@ ver@@ ing you from your mother &apos;s wom@@ b . &quot;
Oh , that guy .
And , but of course , actually , it did cl@@ ick .
This man was D@@ r. K@@ e@@ an , a man that I had only known about through my mother &apos;s stories of that day , because , of course , ty@@ pic@@ al fas@@ hi@@ on , I arriv@@ ed late for my bir@@ th@@ day by two weeks .
And so my mother &apos;s pren@@ at@@ al phys@@ ici@@ an had gone on v@@ ac@@ ation , so the man who del@@ i@@ ver@@ ed me was a compl@@ ete str@@ ang@@ er to my parents .
And , because I was born without the fi@@ bu@@ la b@@ ones , and had feet turned in , and a few to@@ es in this f@@ oot and a few to@@ es in that , he had to be the be@@ ar@@ er -- this str@@ ang@@ er had to be the be@@ ar@@ er of bad news .
He said to me , &quot; I had to give this prog@@ n@@ os@@ is to your parents that you would never walk , and you would never have the kind of mo@@ bility that other kids have or any kind of life of inde@@ pend@@ ence , and you &apos;ve been making li@@ ar out of me ever since . &quot; The extra@@ ordinary thing is that he said he had sav@@ ed ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er cli@@ p@@ p@@ ings thr@@ ough@@ out my whole chil@@ d@@ hood , whether w@@ inning a second gr@@ ade sp@@ el@@ ling be@@ e ,
mar@@ ching with the G@@ ir@@ l S@@ cou@@ ts , you know , the H@@ al@@ lo@@ ween par@@ ade , w@@ inning my colle@@ ge sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship , or any of my s@@ port@@ s vic@@ tor@@ ies , and he was using it , and integr@@ ating it into teach@@ ing resid@@ ent students , m@@ ed students from H@@ ah@@ nem@@ an@@ n M@@ ed@@ ical Sch@@ ool and H@@ er@@ sh@@ ey M@@ ed@@ ical Sch@@ ool .
And he called this part of the course the X F@@ ac@@ tor , the pot@@ ential of the human will .
No prog@@ n@@ os@@ is can acc@@ ount for how powerful this could be as a determin@@ ant in the quality of someone &apos;s life .
And D@@ r. K@@ e@@ an went on to tell me , he said , &quot; In my experience , un@@ less re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly told o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se , and even if given a mo@@ dic@@ um of support , if left to their own de@@ vic@@ es , a child will achi@@ eve . &quot;
S@@ ee , D@@ r. K@@ e@@ an made that shi@@ ft in thinking .
He underst@@ ood that there &apos;s a difference between the medic@@ al cond@@ ition and what someone might do with it .
And there &apos;s been a shi@@ ft in my thinking over time , in that , if you had asked me at 15 years old , if I would have tra@@ ded pros@@ th@@ et@@ ics for fl@@ es@@ h@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ b@@ one leg@@ s , I wouldn &apos;t have h@@ es@@ it@@ ated for a second .
I as@@ pi@@ red to that kind of norm@@ alc@@ y back then .
But if you ask me today , I &apos;m not so sure .
And it &apos;s because of the experi@@ ences I &apos;ve had with them , not in sp@@ ite of the experi@@ ences I &apos;ve had with them .
And perhaps this shi@@ ft in me has happened because I &apos;ve been ex@@ posed to more people who have open@@ ed do@@ ors for me than those who have put li@@ ds and cas@@ t sh@@ ad@@ o@@ ws on me .
S@@ ee , all you really need is one person to show you the epi@@ ph@@ any of your own power , and you &apos;re off . If you can hand somebody the key to their own power -- the human spiri@@ t is so rec@@ ep@@ tive -- if you can do that and open a door for someone at a cru@@ ci@@ al moment , you are educ@@ ating them in the best sense .
You &apos;re teach@@ ing them to open do@@ ors for themselves .
In fact , the ex@@ act mean@@ ing of the word &quot; educ@@ ate &quot; comes from the ro@@ ot word &quot; ed@@ u@@ ce . &quot; It means &quot; to bring for@@ th what is within , to bring out pot@@ ential . &quot;
So again , which pot@@ ential do we want to bring out ?
There was a case study done in 19@@ 6@@ 0s Brit@@ ain , when they were moving from gr@@ am@@ ma@@ r schools to com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ sive schools .
It &apos;s called the stre@@ am@@ ing tri@@ als . We call it &quot; trac@@ king &quot; here in the States .
It &apos;s separ@@ ating students from A , B , C , D and so on .
And the &quot; A students &quot; get the tou@@ gh@@ er cur@@ ric@@ ul@@ um , the best teach@@ ers , et@@ c . Well , they took , over a thre@@ e-@@ month period , D@@ -@@ level students , gave them A &apos;s , told them they were &quot; A &apos;s , &quot; told them they were b@@ right ,
and at the end of this thre@@ e-@@ month period , they were per@@ form@@ ing at A@@ -@@ level . And , of course , the hear@@ t@@ brea@@ king , f@@ li@@ p side of this study , is that they took the &quot; A students &quot; and told them they were &quot; D &apos;s . &quot; And that &apos;s what happened at the end of that thre@@ e-@@ month period .
Th@@ ose who were still around in school , b@@ es@@ ide@@ s the people who had dr@@ op@@ ped out .
A cru@@ ci@@ al part of this case study was that the teach@@ ers were du@@ ped too .
The teach@@ ers didn &apos;t know a sw@@ it@@ ch had been made .
They were simply told , &quot; These are the &apos; A@@ -@@ students , &apos; these are the &apos; D@@ -@@ students . &apos; &quot;
And that &apos;s how they went about teach@@ ing them and tre@@ ating them .
So , I think that the only true dis@@ ability is a cr@@ ush@@ ed spiri@@ t , a spiri@@ t that &apos;s been cr@@ ush@@ ed doesn &apos;t have hope ,
it doesn &apos;t see be@@ aut@@ y ,
it no longer has our natural , chil@@ d@@ like curi@@ os@@ ity and our inn@@ ate ability to imagine .
If instead , we can bol@@ ster a human spiri@@ t to keep hope , to see be@@ aut@@ y in themselves and others , to be curi@@ ous and imagin@@ ative , then we are tru@@ ly using our power well .
When a spiri@@ t has those qual@@ ities , we are able to create new real@@ ities and new ways of being .
I &apos;d like to leave you with a po@@ e@@ m by a f@@ our@@ te@@ en@@ th@@ -@@ century Per@@ si@@ an po@@ et nam@@ ed H@@ a@@ fi@@ z that my friend , J@@ acqu@@ es D@@ em@@ bo@@ is told me about ,
and the po@@ e@@ m is called &quot; The God W@@ ho O@@ n@@ ly K@@ no@@ ws F@@ our Wor@@ ds &quot; : &quot; E@@ very child has known God , not the God of nam@@ es , not the God of don &apos;@@ ts , but the God who only knows four words and ke@@ ep@@ s re@@ pe@@ ating them , saying , &apos; Come d@@ ance with me . Come , d@@ ance with me . Come , d@@ ance with me . &apos; &quot;
Thank you .
