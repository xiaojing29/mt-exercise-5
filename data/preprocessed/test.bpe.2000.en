S@@ ever@@ al years ago here at TED , P@@ et@@ er S@@ k@@ ill@@ man in@@ tro@@ d@@ uc@@ ed a design ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge called the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge .
And the idea &apos;s pret@@ ty sim@@ ple :
T@@ e@@ am@@ s of four have to buil@@ d the t@@ all@@ est fre@@ e-@@ st@@ and@@ ing struc@@ ture out of 20 st@@ ic@@ ks of sp@@ ag@@ h@@ etti , one y@@ ard of t@@ ap@@ e , one y@@ ard of str@@ ing and a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
The mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low has to be on top .
And , th@@ ough it se@@ em@@ s really sim@@ ple , it &apos;s actually pret@@ ty h@@ ard because it for@@ ces people to coll@@ abor@@ ate very qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly .
And so , I thought this was an interesting idea , and I in@@ cor@@ por@@ ated it into a design wor@@ k@@ sho@@ p .
And it was a h@@ u@@ ge succ@@ ess .
And sin@@ ce then , I &apos;ve con@@ d@@ uc@@ ted about 7@@ 0 design wor@@ k@@ sh@@ op@@ s ac@@ ros@@ s the world with stud@@ ents and desig@@ n@@ ers and archit@@ ects , even the C@@ T@@ O@@ s of the F@@ or@@ t@@ un@@ e 50 ,
and there &apos;s something about this ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se that re@@ ve@@ als very de@@ ep l@@ ess@@ ons about the nat@@ ure of coll@@ abor@@ ation , and I &apos;d like to sh@@ are some of them with you .
So , nor@@ m@@ ally , most people beg@@ in by ori@@ ent@@ ing th@@ em@@ selves to the t@@ as@@ k .
They talk about it , they fi@@ g@@ ure out what it &apos;s going to look like , they j@@ oc@@ k@@ ey for power . Th@@ en they s@@ pen@@ d some time plan@@ ning , organi@@ z@@ ing ,
they sk@@ et@@ ch and they l@@ ay out sp@@ ag@@ h@@ etti .
They s@@ pen@@ d the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of their time as@@ sem@@ bl@@ ing the st@@ ic@@ ks into ever@@ -@@ gro@@ wing struc@@ tu@@ res . And then fin@@ ally , just as they &apos;re r@@ un@@ ning out of time , some@@ one ta@@ kes out the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and then they g@@ ing@@ er@@ ly put it on top , and then they st@@ and back , and -- ta@@ -@@ da ! --
they ad@@ mi@@ re their work .
But what really happen@@ s , most of the time , is that the &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; tur@@ ns into an &quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ o@@ h , &quot; because the we@@ i@@ ght of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low ca@@ us@@ es the enti@@ re struc@@ ture to b@@ uc@@ k@@ le and to coll@@ ap@@ se .
So there are a num@@ ber of people who have a lot more &quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ o@@ h &quot; mom@@ ents than o@@ th@@ ers , and am@@ ong the wor@@ st are rec@@ ent gr@@ ad@@ u@@ ates of bus@@ iness sch@@ ool .
They li@@ e , they ch@@ e@@ at , they get distr@@ ac@@ ted and they produ@@ ce really l@@ ame struc@@ tu@@ res .
And of course there are te@@ am@@ s that have a lot more &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; struc@@ tu@@ res , and am@@ ong the b@@ est are rec@@ ent gr@@ ad@@ u@@ ates of kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ t@@ en .
And it &apos;s pret@@ ty am@@ az@@ ing .
A@@ s P@@ et@@ er tel@@ ls us , not only do they produ@@ ce the t@@ all@@ est struc@@ tu@@ res , but they &apos;re the most interesting struc@@ tu@@ res of them all .
So the question you want to as@@ k is : How come ? Wh@@ y ? What is it about them ?
And P@@ et@@ er li@@ kes to say that n@@ one of the kids s@@ pen@@ d any time trying to be C@@ E@@ O of S@@ pag@@ h@@ etti , In@@ c . Ri@@ ght ?
They don &apos;t s@@ pen@@ d time j@@ oc@@ ke@@ ying for power .
But there &apos;s another reas@@ on as well .
And the reas@@ on is that bus@@ iness stud@@ ents are tr@@ ain@@ ed to find the sing@@ le right pl@@ an , right ?
And then they ex@@ ec@@ ute on it .
And then what happen@@ s is , when they put the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on the top , they r@@ un out of time and what happen@@ s ?
It &apos;s a c@@ ris@@ is .
S@@ ound fami@@ li@@ ar ? Ri@@ ght .
What kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten@@ ers do differ@@ ent@@ ly is that they start with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and they buil@@ d prot@@ ot@@ y@@ p@@ es , succ@@ essi@@ ve prot@@ ot@@ y@@ p@@ es , always ke@@ ep@@ ing the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on top , so they have m@@ ulti@@ ple times to fi@@ x when they buil@@ d prot@@ ot@@ y@@ p@@ es al@@ ong the way .
D@@ es@@ ig@@ n@@ ers rec@@ og@@ ni@@ ze this t@@ y@@ pe of coll@@ abor@@ ation as the ess@@ ence of the it@@ er@@ ative proc@@ ess .
And with each ver@@ sion , kids get inst@@ ant fe@@ ed@@ back about what wor@@ ks and what doesn &apos;t work .
So the cap@@ ac@@ ity to play in prot@@ ot@@ y@@ pe is really ess@@ enti@@ al , but let &apos;s look at how different te@@ am@@ s per@@ form .
So the aver@@ age for most people is around 20 in@@ ch@@ es ; bus@@ iness sch@@ o@@ ol@@ s stud@@ ents , about hal@@ f of that ; la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , a little better , but not much better than that , kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten@@ ers , better than most ad@@ ul@@ ts .
W@@ ho does the very b@@ est ?
Ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ects and eng@@ in@@ e@@ ers , th@@ an@@ k@@ f@@ ul@@ ly .
Th@@ ir@@ t@@ y@@ -@@ n@@ ine in@@ ch@@ es is the t@@ all@@ est struc@@ ture I &apos;ve se@@ en .
And why is it ? Because they understand tri@@ ang@@ les and sel@@ f@@ -@@ re@@ in@@ for@@ c@@ ing ge@@ om@@ e@@ tr@@ ical p@@ atter@@ ns are the k@@ ey to building st@@ able struc@@ tu@@ res .
So C@@ E@@ O@@ s , a little bit better than aver@@ age ,
but here &apos;s where it g@@ ets interesting .
If you put you put an ex@@ ec@@ uti@@ ve ad@@ min@@ . on the te@@ am , they get signi@@ fic@@ ant@@ ly better .
It &apos;s incredi@@ ble . You know , you look around , you go , &quot; Oh , that te@@ am &apos;s going to w@@ in . &quot; You can just tell be@@ for@@ e@@ h@@ and . And why is that ?
Because they have speci@@ al sk@@ ill@@ s of fac@@ il@@ it@@ ation .
They man@@ age the proc@@ ess , they understand the proc@@ ess .
And any te@@ am who man@@ ag@@ es and p@@ ays cl@@ ose at@@ ten@@ tion to work will signi@@ fic@@ ant@@ ly im@@ pr@@ ove the te@@ am &apos;s per@@ for@@ man@@ ce .
S@@ pe@@ ci@@ ali@@ zed sk@@ ill@@ s and fac@@ il@@ it@@ ation sk@@ ill@@ s are the com@@ b@@ in@@ ation that lead@@ s to str@@ ong succ@@ ess .
If you have 10 te@@ am@@ s that t@@ y@@ pic@@ ally per@@ form , you &apos;ll get ma@@ y@@ be si@@ x or so that have st@@ and@@ ing struc@@ tu@@ res .
And I tri@@ ed something interesting .
I thought , let &apos;s up the ante , on@@ ce .
So I off@@ er@@ ed a 1@@ 0@@ ,000 dol@@ l@@ ar pr@@ i@@ ze of so@@ f@@ tw@@ are to the w@@ in@@ ning te@@ am .
So what do you think happen@@ ed to these design stud@@ ents ?
What was the res@@ ul@@ t ?
Here &apos;s what happen@@ ed :
N@@ o@@ t one te@@ am had a st@@ and@@ ing struc@@ ture .
If any@@ one had buil@@ t , say , a one in@@ ch struc@@ ture , they would have ta@@ k@@ en h@@ ome the pr@@ i@@ ze .
So , is@@ n &apos;t that interesting ? That h@@ ig@@ h st@@ a@@ kes have a str@@ ong imp@@ act .
We did the ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se again with the same stud@@ ents .
What do you think happen@@ ed then ?
So now they understand the val@@ ue of prot@@ ot@@ y@@ p@@ ing .
So the same te@@ am went from being the very wor@@ st to being am@@ ong the very b@@ est .
They produc@@ ed the t@@ all@@ est struc@@ tu@@ res in the le@@ ast am@@ oun@@ t of time .
So there &apos;s de@@ ep l@@ ess@@ ons for us about the nat@@ ure of inc@@ enti@@ ves and succ@@ ess . So , you might as@@ k : Wh@@ y would any@@ one actually s@@ pen@@ d time w@@ rit@@ ing a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge ?
And the reas@@ on is , I hel@@ p create di@@ g@@ it@@ al to@@ ol@@ s and proc@@ ess@@ es to hel@@ p te@@ am@@ s buil@@ d car@@ s and video g@@ am@@ es and vi@@ su@@ al eff@@ ects .
And what the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge does is it hel@@ ps them id@@ enti@@ f@@ y the hi@@ d@@ de@@ n as@@ sum@@ p@@ tions .
Because , fr@@ an@@ k@@ ly , every pro@@ ject has its own mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , doesn &apos;t it ?
The ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge prov@@ ide@@ s a sh@@ ar@@ ed ex@@ peri@@ ence , a comm@@ on lan@@ gu@@ age , a comm@@ on st@@ ance to buil@@ d the right prot@@ ot@@ y@@ pe .
And so , this is the val@@ ue of the ex@@ peri@@ ence , of this so sim@@ ple ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se .
And those of you who are inter@@ es@@ ted may want to go to Mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ w@@ Ch@@ all@@ eng@@ e@@ .@@ com@@ .
It &apos;s a b@@ lo@@ g that you can look at how to buil@@ d the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ ws .
There &apos;s ste@@ p@@ -@@ b@@ y@@ -@@ ste@@ p in@@ struc@@ tions on this .
There are c@@ ra@@ z@@ y exam@@ pl@@ es from around the world of how people tw@@ ea@@ k and ad@@ just the system .
There &apos;s world re@@ cor@@ ds that are on this as well .
And the fun@@ d@@ ament@@ al l@@ ess@@ on , I believe , is that design tru@@ ly is a cont@@ act s@@ por@@ t .
It dem@@ ands that we br@@ ing all of our sen@@ s@@ es to the t@@ as@@ k , and that we app@@ ly the very b@@ est of our thinking , our fe@@ el@@ ing and our doing to the ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge that we have at h@@ and .
And some@@ times , a little prot@@ ot@@ y@@ pe of this ex@@ peri@@ ence is all that it ta@@ kes to tur@@ n us from an &quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ o@@ h &quot; mom@@ ent to a &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; mom@@ ent .
And that can make a big differ@@ ence .
Thank you very much .
L@@ et &apos;s pre@@ ten@@ d right here we have a ma@@ ch@@ ine . A big ma@@ ch@@ ine , a c@@ ool , TE@@ D@@ -@@ is@@ h ma@@ ch@@ ine , and it &apos;s a time ma@@ ch@@ ine .
And every@@ one in this ro@@ om has to get into it .
And you can go bac@@ k@@ war@@ ds , you can go for@@ war@@ ds ; you can@@ not st@@ ay where you are .
And I w@@ on@@ der what you &apos;d ch@@ o@@ ose , because I &apos;ve been as@@ king my fri@@ en@@ ds this question a lot l@@ at@@ ely and they all want to go back .
I don &apos;t know . They want to go back before there were aut@@ om@@ o@@ bil@@ es or T@@ w@@ itt@@ er or &quot; Amer@@ ic@@ an I@@ do@@ l . &quot;
I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed that there &apos;s some sort of p@@ ul@@ l to n@@ os@@ tal@@ gia , to wi@@ sh@@ ful thinking .
And I understand that .
I &apos;m not part of that c@@ ro@@ w@@ d , I have to say .
I don &apos;t want to go back , and it &apos;s not because I &apos;m ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ ous . It &apos;s because possi@@ bil@@ ities on this plan@@ et , they don &apos;t go back , they go for@@ w@@ ard .
So I want to get in the ma@@ ch@@ ine , and I want to go for@@ w@@ ard .
This is the gre@@ at@@ est time there &apos;s ever been on this plan@@ et by any me@@ as@@ ure that you w@@ is@@ h to ch@@ o@@ ose : he@@ al@@ th , we@@ al@@ th , mo@@ bil@@ ity , opportun@@ ity , de@@ cl@@ in@@ ing r@@ ates of di@@ se@@ ase ...
There &apos;s never been a time like this .
M@@ y gre@@ at@@ -@@ gr@@ and@@ par@@ ents di@@ ed , all of them , by the time they were 6@@ 0 .
M@@ y gr@@ and@@ par@@ ents p@@ us@@ h@@ ed that num@@ ber to 7@@ 0 .
M@@ y par@@ ents are cl@@ os@@ ing in on 8@@ 0 .
So there better be a n@@ ine at the beg@@ in@@ ning of my de@@ at@@ h num@@ ber .
But it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bi@@ gg@@ er de@@ al than that .
A ki@@ d bor@@ n in New D@@ el@@ h@@ i today can ex@@ p@@ ect to live as long as the ri@@ ch@@ est man in the world did 100 years ago .
Th@@ in@@ k about that , it &apos;s an incredi@@ ble fact .
And why is it tru@@ e ?
S@@ m@@ all@@ po@@ x . S@@ m@@ all@@ po@@ x k@@ ill@@ ed bil@@ li@@ ons of people on this plan@@ et .
It res@@ hap@@ ed the dem@@ og@@ rap@@ h@@ y of the g@@ lo@@ be in a way that no w@@ ar ever has .
It &apos;s g@@ one . It &apos;s v@@ an@@ i@@ sh@@ ed .
We v@@ an@@ qu@@ i@@ sh@@ ed it . P@@ u@@ ff .
In the r@@ ich world , di@@ se@@ as@@ es that th@@ re@@ at@@ en@@ ed mil@@ li@@ ons of us just a gener@@ ation ago no l@@ ong@@ er ex@@ ist , har@@ d@@ ly .
D@@ i@@ ph@@ ther@@ ia , ru@@ bel@@ la , pol@@ io ...
does any@@ one even know what those things are ?
V@@ acc@@ in@@ es , mo@@ der@@ n me@@ dic@@ ine , our abil@@ ity to fe@@ ed bil@@ li@@ ons of people , those are tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s of the scienti@@ fi@@ c me@@ th@@ od .
And to my min@@ d , the scienti@@ fi@@ c me@@ th@@ od -- trying stuff out , se@@ e@@ ing if it wor@@ ks , chang@@ ing it when it doesn &apos;t -- is one of the great ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ m@@ ents of hum@@ an@@ ity .
So that &apos;s the good ne@@ ws .
Un@@ fort@@ un@@ at@@ ely , that &apos;s all the good ne@@ ws because there are some other problem@@ s , and they &apos;ve been men@@ ti@@ on@@ ed many times . And one of them is that des@@ p@@ ite all our ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ m@@ ents , a bil@@ lion people go to b@@ ed h@@ un@@ gr@@ y in this world every day .
That num@@ ber &apos;s ris@@ ing , and it &apos;s ris@@ ing really rap@@ id@@ ly , and it &apos;s dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ e@@ ful .
And not only that , we &apos;ve used our imag@@ in@@ ation to th@@ or@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly tras@@ h this g@@ lo@@ be .
P@@ ot@@ able water , ar@@ able land , ra@@ in@@ for@@ es@@ ts , o@@ il , g@@ as : they &apos;re going away , and they &apos;re going away so@@ on , and un@@ less we inn@@ ov@@ ate our way out of this m@@ ess , we &apos;re going away too .
So the question is : C@@ an we do that ? And I think we can .
I think it &apos;s c@@ le@@ ar that we can make f@@ ood that will fe@@ ed bil@@ li@@ ons of people with@@ out rap@@ ing the land that they live on .
I think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t also des@@ tro@@ y it .
I really do believe that , and , no , it ain &apos;t wi@@ sh@@ ful thinking .
But here &apos;s the thing that ke@@ ep@@ s me up at ni@@ ght -- one of the things that ke@@ ep@@ s me up at ni@@ ght :
We &apos;ve never ne@@ e@@ ded prog@@ res@@ s in sci@@ ence more than we need it right now . N@@ ever . And we &apos;ve also never been in a pos@@ ition to de@@ pl@@ o@@ y it pro@@ per@@ ly in the way that we can today .
We &apos;re on the ver@@ ge of am@@ az@@ ing , am@@ az@@ ing ev@@ ents in many fi@@ el@@ ds ,
and y@@ et I actually think we &apos;d have to go back h@@ un@@ dre@@ ds , 3@@ 00 years , before the En@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ment , to find a time when we b@@ att@@ l@@ ed prog@@ res@@ s , when we f@@ ou@@ ght about these things more vi@@ g@@ or@@ ous@@ ly , on more fron@@ ts , than we do now .
P@@ e@@ ople w@@ ra@@ p th@@ em@@ selves in their beli@@ ef@@ s , and they do it so ti@@ gh@@ tly that you can &apos;t se@@ t them f@@ ree .
N@@ o@@ t even the tr@@ ut@@ h will se@@ t them f@@ ree .
And , li@@ st@@ en , every@@ one &apos;s ent@@ it@@ l@@ ed to their op@@ in@@ i@@ on ; they &apos;re even ent@@ it@@ l@@ ed to their op@@ in@@ i@@ on about prog@@ res@@ s . But you know what you &apos;re not ent@@ it@@ l@@ ed to ?
You &apos;re not ent@@ it@@ l@@ ed to your own fac@@ ts . S@@ or@@ ry , you &apos;re not .
And this took me a@@ wh@@ ile to fi@@ g@@ ure out .
A@@ b@@ out a de@@ c@@ ade ago , I wr@@ ot@@ e a story about v@@ acc@@ in@@ es for The New Yor@@ k@@ er . A little story .
And I was am@@ az@@ ed to find op@@ pos@@ ition : op@@ pos@@ ition to what is , after all , the most eff@@ ec@@ tive pub@@ li@@ c he@@ al@@ th me@@ as@@ ure in human h@@ ist@@ ory .
I didn &apos;t know what to do , so I just did what I do : I wr@@ ot@@ e a story and I mov@@ ed on .
And so@@ on after that , I wr@@ ot@@ e a story about gen@@ et@@ ically eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ed f@@ ood .
S@@ ame thing , only bi@@ gg@@ er .
P@@ e@@ ople were going c@@ ra@@ z@@ y .
So I wr@@ ot@@ e a story about that too , and I cou@@ ldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; F@@ ran@@ k@@ en@@ f@@ oo@@ ds , &quot; why they thought mov@@ ing mol@@ ec@@ ul@@ es around in a speci@@ fi@@ c , ra@@ ther than a hap@@ h@@ az@@ ard way , was tr@@ es@@ pass@@ ing on nat@@ ure &apos;s gr@@ ound .
But , you know , I do what I do . I wr@@ ot@@ e the story , I mov@@ ed on .
I mean , I &apos;m a j@@ our@@ n@@ al@@ ist . We t@@ y@@ pe , we fi@@ le , we go to d@@ inn@@ er . It &apos;s fine .
But these stor@@ ies bo@@ ther@@ ed me , and I cou@@ ldn &apos;t fi@@ g@@ ure out why , and ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally I did .
And that &apos;s because those f@@ an@@ at@@ ics that were d@@ riv@@ ing me c@@ ra@@ z@@ y w@@ er@@ en &apos;t actually f@@ an@@ at@@ ics at all .
They were thou@@ gh@@ t@@ ful people , educ@@ ated people , de@@ c@@ ent people .
They were ex@@ ac@@ tly like the people in this ro@@ om .
And it just dist@@ ur@@ b@@ ed me so much .
But then I thought , you know , let &apos;s be h@@ on@@ est . We &apos;re at a point in this world where we don &apos;t have the same rel@@ ati@@ on@@ shi@@ p to prog@@ res@@ s that we used to .
We talk about it ambi@@ val@@ ent@@ ly .
We talk about it in ir@@ on@@ ic ter@@ ms with little quot@@ es around it : &quot; prog@@ res@@ s . &quot; O@@ k@@ ay , there are reas@@ ons for that , and I think we know what those reas@@ ons are .
We &apos;ve l@@ os@@ t fa@@ ith in inst@@ itu@@ tions , in au@@ th@@ or@@ ity , and some@@ times in sci@@ ence it@@ self , and there &apos;s no reas@@ on we sh@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t have .
You can just say a few n@@ am@@ es and people will understand .
Ch@@ er@@ no@@ b@@ y@@ l , B@@ h@@ op@@ al , the Ch@@ all@@ eng@@ er , V@@ i@@ o@@ x@@ x , we@@ ap@@ ons of mas@@ s des@@ tr@@ uc@@ tion , h@@ ang@@ ing ch@@ ad@@ s .
You know , you can ch@@ o@@ ose your li@@ st .
There are ques@@ tions and problem@@ s with the people we used to believe were always right ,
so be sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ al .
A@@ s@@ k ques@@ tions , dem@@ and pro@@ of , dem@@ and ev@@ id@@ ence .
D@@ on &apos;t take any@@ thing for gran@@ ted .
But here &apos;s the thing : When you get pro@@ of , you need to acc@@ e@@ pt the pro@@ of , and we &apos;re not that good at doing that .
And the reas@@ on that I can say that is because we &apos;re now in an e@@ pi@@ de@@ mi@@ c of fe@@ ar like one I &apos;ve never se@@ en and h@@ ope never to see again .
A@@ b@@ out 1@@ 2 years ago , there was a story pub@@ li@@ sh@@ ed , a h@@ or@@ ri@@ ble story , that lin@@ ked the e@@ pi@@ de@@ mi@@ c of au@@ ti@@ s@@ m to the me@@ as@@ les , m@@ um@@ ps and ru@@ bel@@ la v@@ acc@@ ine sho@@ t .
V@@ er@@ y sc@@ ary .
T@@ ons of stu@@ di@@ es were done to see if this was tru@@ e .
T@@ ons of stu@@ di@@ es should have been done ; it &apos;s a ser@@ i@@ ous is@@ su@@ e .
The data came back .
The data came back from the Un@@ ited St@@ ates , from En@@ g@@ land , from S@@ we@@ de@@ n , from C@@ an@@ ada , and it was all the same : no cor@@ rel@@ ation , no con@@ nec@@ tion , n@@ one at all .
It doesn &apos;t matt@@ er . It doesn &apos;t matt@@ er because we believe an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ es , we believe what we see , what we think we see , what ma@@ kes us fe@@ el real .
We don &apos;t believe a b@@ un@@ ch of d@@ oc@@ um@@ ents from a gover@@ n@@ ment off@@ ici@@ al gi@@ ving us data , and I do understand that , I think we all do .
But you know what ?
The res@@ ul@@ t of that has been dis@@ as@@ tr@@ ous .
D@@ is@@ as@@ tr@@ ous because here &apos;s a fact : The Un@@ ited St@@ ates is one of the only coun@@ tri@@ es in the world where the v@@ acc@@ ine r@@ ate for me@@ as@@ les is going down .
That is dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ e@@ ful , and we should be as@@ h@@ am@@ ed of our@@ selves .
It &apos;s h@@ or@@ ri@@ ble .
What kind of a thing happen@@ ed that we could do that ?
Now , I understand it . I do understand it .
Because , did any@@ one have me@@ as@@ les here ?
H@@ as one person in this au@@ di@@ ence ever se@@ en some@@ one di@@ e of me@@ as@@ les ?
D@@ o@@ esn &apos;t happ@@ en very much .
D@@ o@@ esn &apos;t happ@@ en in this coun@@ try at all , but it happen@@ ed 1@@ 6@@ 0@@ ,000 times in the world last year .
That &apos;s a lot of de@@ at@@ h of me@@ as@@ les -- 20 an h@@ our .
But sin@@ ce it didn &apos;t happ@@ en here , we can put it out of our min@@ ds , and people like J@@ en@@ n@@ y M@@ c@@ C@@ ar@@ th@@ y can go around pre@@ ach@@ ing m@@ ess@@ ag@@ es of fe@@ ar and ill@@ it@@ er@@ ac@@ y from pl@@ at@@ form@@ s like &quot; O@@ pr@@ a@@ h &quot; and &quot; L@@ ar@@ ry K@@ ing Li@@ ve . &quot;
And they can do it because they don &apos;t lin@@ k ca@@ us@@ ation and cor@@ rel@@ ation .
They don &apos;t understand that these things se@@ e@@ m the same , but they &apos;re al@@ most never the same .
And it &apos;s something we need to lear@@ n , and we need to lear@@ n it really so@@ on .
This gu@@ y was a h@@ ero , J@@ on@@ as S@@ alk .
He took one of the wor@@ st sc@@ our@@ g@@ es of man@@ kind away from us .
No fe@@ ar , no ag@@ on@@ y . P@@ ol@@ io -- pu@@ ff , g@@ one .
That gu@@ y in the mi@@ d@@ d@@ le , not so much .
H@@ is n@@ ame is P@@ au@@ l O@@ ff@@ it .
He just devel@@ op@@ ed a r@@ ot@@ av@@ ir@@ us v@@ acc@@ ine with a b@@ un@@ ch of other people .
It &apos;ll s@@ ave the li@@ ves of 4@@ 00 to 5@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,000 kids in the devel@@ op@@ ing world every year .
P@@ ret@@ ty good , right ?
Well , it &apos;s good , exc@@ e@@ pt that P@@ au@@ l go@@ es around tal@@ king about v@@ acc@@ in@@ es and says how val@@ u@@ able they are and that people ou@@ ght to just st@@ op the wh@@ in@@ ing .
And he actually says it that way .
So , P@@ au@@ l &apos;s a ter@@ r@@ or@@ ist .
When P@@ au@@ l spe@@ a@@ ks in a pub@@ li@@ c hear@@ ing , he can &apos;t tes@@ ti@@ f@@ y with@@ out ar@@ m@@ ed guar@@ ds .
He g@@ ets called at h@@ ome because people like to tell him that they re@@ mem@@ ber where his kids go to sch@@ ool .
And why ? Because P@@ au@@ l made a v@@ acc@@ ine .
I don &apos;t need to say this , but v@@ acc@@ in@@ es are ess@@ enti@@ al .
You take them away , di@@ se@@ ase comes back , h@@ or@@ ri@@ ble di@@ se@@ as@@ es . And that &apos;s happen@@ ing .
We have me@@ as@@ les in this coun@@ try now .
And it &apos;s getting wor@@ se , and pret@@ ty so@@ on kids are going to di@@ e of it again because it &apos;s just a num@@ b@@ ers g@@ ame .
And they &apos;re not just going to di@@ e of me@@ as@@ les .
What about pol@@ io ? L@@ et &apos;s have that . Wh@@ y not ?
A col@@ le@@ ge cl@@ ass@@ m@@ ate of m@@ ine wr@@ ot@@ e me a cou@@ ple we@@ e@@ ks ago and said she thought I was a little str@@ id@@ ent .
No one &apos;s ever said that before .
S@@ he w@@ as@@ n &apos;t going to v@@ acc@@ in@@ ate her ki@@ d ag@@ ain@@ st pol@@ io ,
no way .
F@@ ine .
Wh@@ y ? Because we don &apos;t have pol@@ io . And you know what ?
We didn &apos;t have pol@@ io in this coun@@ try y@@ es@@ ter@@ day .
T@@ o@@ day , I don &apos;t know , ma@@ y@@ be a gu@@ y got on a plan@@ e in L@@ ag@@ os this mor@@ ning , and he &apos;s fl@@ ying to L@@ A@@ X , right now he &apos;s over O@@ h@@ io .
And he &apos;s going to land in a cou@@ ple of h@@ our@@ s , he &apos;s going to r@@ ent a c@@ ar , and he &apos;s going to come to L@@ ong Be@@ ach , and he &apos;s going to at@@ ten@@ d one of these f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous TED d@@ inn@@ ers t@@ oni@@ ght .
And he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s inf@@ ec@@ ted with a par@@ al@@ y@@ ti@@ c di@@ se@@ ase , and we don &apos;t ei@@ ther because that &apos;s the way the world wor@@ ks .
That &apos;s the plan@@ et we live on . D@@ on &apos;t pre@@ ten@@ d it is@@ n &apos;t .
Now , we love to w@@ ra@@ p our@@ selves in li@@ es . We love to do it .
E@@ ver@@ y@@ one take their v@@ it@@ am@@ in@@ s this mor@@ ning ?
E@@ ch@@ in@@ ac@@ ea , a little anti@@ o@@ x@@ id@@ ant to get you going .
I know you did because hal@@ f of Amer@@ ic@@ ans do every day .
They take the stuff , and they take al@@ ter@@ n@@ ative me@@ dic@@ in@@ es , and it doesn &apos;t matt@@ er how o@@ f@@ t@@ en we find out that they &apos;re us@@ el@@ ess .
The data says it all the time .
They dar@@ k@@ en your ur@@ ine . They al@@ most never do more than that .
It &apos;s o@@ k@@ ay , you want to p@@ ay 2@@ 8 bil@@ lion dollar@@ s for dar@@ k ur@@ ine ? I &apos;m t@@ ot@@ ally with you .
D@@ ar@@ k ur@@ ine . D@@ ar@@ k .
Wh@@ y do we do that ? Wh@@ y do we do that ?
Well , I think I understand , we h@@ ate B@@ i@@ g P@@ har@@ ma .
We h@@ ate B@@ i@@ g G@@ over@@ n@@ ment . We don &apos;t tr@@ ust the M@@ an .
And we sh@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t : O@@ u@@ r he@@ al@@ th c@@ are system su@@ c@@ ks .
It &apos;s cr@@ u@@ el to mil@@ li@@ ons of people .
It &apos;s ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ ing@@ ly col@@ d and s@@ ou@@ l@@ -@@ b@@ end@@ ing to those of us who can even af@@ for@@ d it .
So we r@@ un away from it , and where do we r@@ un ?
We le@@ a@@ p into the ar@@ ms of B@@ i@@ g P@@ l@@ ac@@ eb@@ o .
That &apos;s f@@ an@@ tast@@ ic . I love B@@ i@@ g P@@ l@@ ac@@ eb@@ o .
But , you know , it &apos;s really a ser@@ i@@ ous thing because this stuff is c@@ ra@@ p , and we s@@ pen@@ d bil@@ li@@ ons of dollar@@ s on it .
And I have all sor@@ ts of little prop@@ s here .
N@@ one of it ... g@@ in@@ k@@ go , fr@@ au@@ d ; e@@ ch@@ in@@ ac@@ ea , fr@@ au@@ d ; ac@@ ai -- I don &apos;t even know what that is but we &apos;re s@@ pen@@ ding bil@@ li@@ ons of dollar@@ s on it -- it &apos;s fr@@ au@@ d .
And you know what ? When I say this stuff , people sc@@ re@@ am at me , and they say , &quot; What do you c@@ are ? L@@ et people do what they want to do .
It ma@@ kes them fe@@ el good . &quot;
And you know what ? You &apos;re wr@@ ong .
Because I don &apos;t c@@ are if it &apos;s the sec@@ ret@@ ary of H@@ H@@ S who &apos;s s@@ aying , &quot; H@@ m@@ m , I &apos;m not going to take the ev@@ id@@ ence of my ex@@ per@@ ts on m@@ am@@ m@@ og@@ ram@@ s , &quot; or some can@@ c@@ er qu@@ ack who wan@@ ts to tre@@ at his p@@ ati@@ ent with co@@ ff@@ ee en@@ em@@ as .
When you start down the ro@@ ad where beli@@ e@@ f and mag@@ ic re@@ place ev@@ id@@ ence and sci@@ ence , you end up in a place you don &apos;t want to be .
You end up in Th@@ ab@@ o M@@ be@@ k@@ i S@@ ou@@ th Africa .
He k@@ ill@@ ed 4@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,000 of his people by in@@ sist@@ ing that be@@ e@@ tr@@ oo@@ t , g@@ ar@@ li@@ c and l@@ em@@ on o@@ il were much more eff@@ ec@@ tive than the anti@@ re@@ trov@@ ir@@ al d@@ ru@@ g@@ s we know can s@@ low the course of A@@ I@@ D@@ S .
H@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of thou@@ s@@ ands of ne@@ ed@@ less de@@ a@@ th@@ s in a coun@@ try that has been pl@@ ag@@ u@@ ed wor@@ se than any other by this di@@ se@@ ase .
P@@ le@@ ase , don &apos;t tell me there are no con@@ se@@ qu@@ en@@ ces to these things .
There are . There always are .
Now , the most min@@ d@@ less e@@ pi@@ de@@ mi@@ c we &apos;re in the mi@@ d@@ d@@ le of right now is this ab@@ sur@@ d b@@ att@@ le between prop@@ on@@ ents of gen@@ et@@ ically eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ed f@@ ood and the organ@@ ic el@@ ite .
It &apos;s an i@@ di@@ ot@@ ic de@@ b@@ ate . It has to st@@ op .
It &apos;s a de@@ b@@ ate about wor@@ ds , about met@@ ap@@ h@@ ors .
It &apos;s ide@@ olog@@ y , it &apos;s not sci@@ ence .
E@@ very sing@@ le thing we e@@ at , every gr@@ ain of r@@ ice , every s@@ pr@@ i@@ g of par@@ s@@ le@@ y , every B@@ r@@ us@@ sel@@ s s@@ pr@@ out has been mo@@ di@@ fi@@ ed by man .
You know , there w@@ er@@ en &apos;t t@@ ang@@ er@@ in@@ es in the g@@ ar@@ de@@ n of E@@ de@@ n .
There w@@ as@@ n &apos;t any can@@ tal@@ ou@@ pe .
There w@@ er@@ en &apos;t Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as tre@@ es . We made it all .
We made it over the last 1@@ 1@@ ,000 years .
And some of it wor@@ ked , and some of it didn &apos;t .
We got ri@@ d of the stuff that didn &apos;t .
Now we can do it in a more pre@@ ci@@ se way --
and there are ris@@ ks , ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely --
but we can put something like v@@ it@@ am@@ in A into r@@ ice , and that stuff can hel@@ p mil@@ li@@ ons of people , mil@@ li@@ ons of people , pr@@ ol@@ ong their li@@ ves .
You don &apos;t want to do that ?
I have to say , I don &apos;t understand it .
We ob@@ ject to gen@@ et@@ ically eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ed f@@ ood .
Wh@@ y do we do that ?
Well , the things I con@@ st@@ ant@@ ly he@@ ar are : T@@ o@@ o many ch@@ em@@ ic@@ als , pes@@ tic@@ ide@@ s , h@@ or@@ mon@@ es , mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ ture , we don &apos;t want gi@@ ant fi@@ el@@ ds of the same thing , that &apos;s wr@@ ong .
We don &apos;t comp@@ an@@ ies p@@ at@@ ent@@ ing life .
We don &apos;t want comp@@ an@@ ies o@@ w@@ ning se@@ ed@@ s .
And you know what my respon@@ se to all of that is ?
Y@@ es , you &apos;re right . L@@ et &apos;s fi@@ x it .
It &apos;s tru@@ e , we &apos;ve got a h@@ u@@ ge f@@ ood problem , but this is@@ n &apos;t sci@@ ence .
This has no@@ thing to do with sci@@ ence .
It &apos;s la@@ w , it &apos;s mor@@ al@@ ity , it &apos;s p@@ at@@ ent stuff .
You know sci@@ ence is@@ n &apos;t a comp@@ any .
It &apos;s not a coun@@ try .
It &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a proc@@ ess .
It &apos;s a proc@@ ess , and some@@ times it wor@@ ks and some@@ times it doesn &apos;t , but the idea that we should not al@@ low sci@@ ence to do its jo@@ b because we &apos;re a@@ fr@@ aid , is really very de@@ ad@@ en@@ ing , and it &apos;s pre@@ vent@@ ing mil@@ li@@ ons of people from pros@@ per@@ ing .
You know , in the next 50 years we &apos;re going to have to gro@@ w 7@@ 0 percent more f@@ ood than we do right now , 7@@ 0 percent .
This inv@@ est@@ ment in Africa over the last 30 years .
D@@ is@@ gr@@ ac@@ e@@ ful . D@@ is@@ gr@@ ac@@ e@@ ful .
They need it , and we &apos;re not gi@@ ving it to them .
And why ? G@@ en@@ et@@ ically eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ed f@@ ood .
We don &apos;t want to en@@ cour@@ age people to e@@ at that r@@ ott@@ en stuff , like c@@ ass@@ ava for inst@@ ance .
C@@ ass@@ ava &apos;s something that hal@@ f a bil@@ lion people e@@ at .
It &apos;s kind of like a pot@@ ato .
It &apos;s just a b@@ un@@ ch of cal@@ or@@ ies . It su@@ c@@ ks .
It doesn &apos;t have nu@@ tri@@ ents , it doesn &apos;t have prot@@ e@@ in , and scienti@@ st@@ s are eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ing all of that into it right now .
And then people would be able to e@@ at it and they &apos;d be able to not go bl@@ in@@ d .
They w@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t star@@ ve , and you know what ?
That would be n@@ ice . It w@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t be C@@ he@@ z P@@ an@@ is@@ se , but it would be n@@ ice .
And all I can say about this is : Wh@@ y are we fi@@ gh@@ ting it ?
I mean , let &apos;s as@@ k our@@ selves : Wh@@ y are we fi@@ gh@@ ting it ?
Because we don &apos;t want to m@@ ove gen@@ es around ?
This is about mov@@ ing gen@@ es around . It &apos;s not about ch@@ em@@ ic@@ als .
It &apos;s not about our ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous pas@@ sion for h@@ or@@ mon@@ es , our in@@ sist@@ ence on hav@@ ing bi@@ gg@@ er f@@ ood , better f@@ ood , sing@@ ular f@@ ood .
This is@@ n &apos;t about R@@ ice K@@ ris@@ pi@@ es ,
this is about ke@@ ep@@ ing people ali@@ ve , and it &apos;s about time we started to understand what that me@@ ant .
Because , you know something ? If we don &apos;t , if we continu@@ e to act the way we &apos;re ac@@ ting , we &apos;re gu@@ il@@ ty of something that I don &apos;t think we want to be gu@@ il@@ ty of : hi@@ gh@@ -@@ tec@@ h col@@ oni@@ al@@ is@@ m .
There &apos;s no other way to des@@ cri@@ be what &apos;s going on here .
It &apos;s sel@@ fis@@ h , it &apos;s u@@ g@@ ly , it &apos;s ben@@ e@@ at@@ h us , and we really have to st@@ op it .
So after this am@@ az@@ ing@@ ly f@@ un con@@ ver@@ s@@ ation , you might want to say , &quot; So , you still want to get in this ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous time ma@@ ch@@ ine and go for@@ w@@ ard ? &quot;
A@@ b@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely . A@@ b@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely , I do .
It &apos;s st@@ uc@@ k in the pres@@ ent right now , but we have an am@@ az@@ ing opportun@@ ity .
We can se@@ t that time ma@@ ch@@ ine on any@@ thing we want .
We can m@@ ove it where we want to m@@ ove it , and we &apos;re going to m@@ ove it where we want to m@@ ove it .
We have to have these con@@ ver@@ s@@ ations and we have to think , but when we get in the time ma@@ ch@@ ine and we go a@@ he@@ ad , we &apos;re going to be happ@@ y we do .
I know that we can , and as far as I &apos;m con@@ cer@@ ned , that &apos;s something the world ne@@ ed@@ s right now .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
One day , L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es T@@ im@@ es col@@ um@@ n@@ ist St@@ eve L@@ op@@ e@@ z was w@@ al@@ king al@@ ong the str@@ e@@ ets of do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es when he hear@@ d be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful mu@@ sic .
And the s@@ our@@ ce was a man , an Afr@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ Amer@@ ic@@ an man , char@@ m@@ ing , ru@@ gg@@ ed , h@@ om@@ el@@ ess , pl@@ aying a vi@@ ol@@ in that only had two str@@ ings .
And I &apos;m tel@@ ling a story that many of you know , because St@@ eve &apos;s col@@ um@@ ns b@@ ec@@ ame the bas@@ is for a b@@ ook , which was tur@@ ned into a mov@@ ie , with R@@ ob@@ er@@ t D@@ o@@ w@@ ne@@ y J@@ r@@ . ac@@ ting as St@@ eve L@@ op@@ e@@ z , and J@@ am@@ ie F@@ o@@ x@@ x as N@@ a@@ th@@ an@@ i@@ el An@@ th@@ on@@ y A@@ y@@ ers , the J@@ u@@ il@@ li@@ ar@@ d@@ -@@ tr@@ ain@@ ed d@@ ou@@ ble bas@@ si@@ st wh@@ ose pr@@ om@@ is@@ ing car@@ e@@ er was c@@ ut sh@@ or@@ t by a tr@@ ag@@ ic aff@@ l@@ ic@@ tion with par@@ an@@ o@@ id s@@ chi@@ z@@ op@@ h@@ ren@@ ia .
N@@ a@@ th@@ an@@ i@@ el dr@@ op@@ p@@ ed out of J@@ u@@ il@@ li@@ ard , he su@@ ff@@ er@@ ed a compl@@ ete bre@@ ak@@ down , and 30 years l@@ ater he was li@@ ving h@@ om@@ el@@ ess on the str@@ e@@ ets of S@@ ki@@ d R@@ ow in do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es .
I en@@ cour@@ age all of you to re@@ ad St@@ eve &apos;s b@@ ook or to w@@ at@@ ch the mov@@ ie to understand not only the be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful b@@ on@@ d that form@@ ed between these two m@@ en ,
I &apos;m J@@ ane M@@ c@@ G@@ on@@ ig@@ al . I &apos;m a g@@ ame desig@@ ner .
I &apos;ve been making g@@ am@@ es on@@ line now for 10 years , and my go@@ al for the next de@@ c@@ ade is to try to make it as e@@ as@@ y to s@@ ave the world in real life as it is to s@@ ave the world in on@@ line g@@ am@@ es .
Now , I have a pl@@ an for this , and it ent@@ a@@ il@@ s con@@ v@@ inc@@ ing more people , inc@@ lu@@ ding all of you , to s@@ pen@@ d more time pl@@ aying bi@@ gg@@ er and better g@@ am@@ es .
Ri@@ ght now we s@@ pen@@ d three bil@@ lion h@@ our@@ s a we@@ e@@ k pl@@ aying on@@ line g@@ am@@ es .
S@@ ome of you might be thinking , &quot; That &apos;s a lot of time to s@@ pen@@ d pl@@ aying g@@ am@@ es .
M@@ ay@@ be too much time , consi@@ der@@ ing how many ur@@ g@@ ent problem@@ s we have to sol@@ ve in the real world . &quot;
But actually , ac@@ cor@@ ding to my res@@ ear@@ ch at the In@@ st@@ itu@@ te for the F@@ ut@@ ure , actually the op@@ pos@@ ite is tru@@ e .
Th@@ ree bil@@ lion h@@ our@@ s a we@@ e@@ k is not ne@@ ar@@ ly enough g@@ ame play to sol@@ ve the world &apos;s most ur@@ g@@ ent problem@@ s .
In fact , I believe that if we want to sur@@ vi@@ ve the next cent@@ ur@@ y on this plan@@ et , we need to incre@@ ase that t@@ ot@@ al d@@ ram@@ at@@ ically .
I &apos;ve c@@ alc@@ ul@@ ated the t@@ ot@@ al we need at 2@@ 1 bil@@ lion h@@ our@@ s of g@@ ame play every we@@ e@@ k .
So , that &apos;s prob@@ ably a bit of a coun@@ ter@@ -@@ in@@ tu@@ iti@@ ve idea , so I &apos;ll say it again , let it sin@@ k in :
If we want to sol@@ ve problem@@ s like h@@ un@@ g@@ er , p@@ over@@ ty , c@@ lim@@ ate change , glob@@ al con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t , ob@@ es@@ ity , I believe that we need to as@@ pi@@ re to play g@@ am@@ es on@@ line for at le@@ ast 2@@ 1 bil@@ lion h@@ our@@ s a we@@ e@@ k , by the end of the next de@@ c@@ ade . No . I &apos;m ser@@ i@@ ous . I am .
Here &apos;s why . This pic@@ ture pret@@ ty much su@@ ms up why I think g@@ am@@ es are so ess@@ enti@@ al to the fut@@ ure sur@@ viv@@ al of the human speci@@ es . T@@ ru@@ ly .
This is a por@@ tra@@ it by ph@@ otog@@ rap@@ her P@@ h@@ il T@@ ol@@ ed@@ ano . He wanted to cap@@ ture the em@@ ot@@ i@@ on of g@@ am@@ ing ,
so he se@@ t up a cam@@ era in fron@@ t of g@@ am@@ ers wh@@ ile they were pl@@ aying .
And this is a c@@ las@@ sic g@@ am@@ ing em@@ ot@@ i@@ on .
Now , if you &apos;re not a g@@ am@@ er , you might mis@@ s some of the nu@@ ance in this ph@@ o@@ to .
You prob@@ ably see the sense of ur@@ gen@@ c@@ y , a little bit of fe@@ ar , but inten@@ se conc@@ entr@@ ation , de@@ ep , de@@ ep f@@ oc@@ us on t@@ ac@@ k@@ ling a really diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t problem .
If you are a g@@ am@@ er , you will not@@ ice a few nu@@ an@@ ces here : the cr@@ in@@ k@@ le of the e@@ y@@ es up , and around the m@@ ou@@ th is a sig@@ n of op@@ ti@@ mis@@ m ,
and the e@@ y@@ eb@@ ro@@ ws up is sur@@ pr@@ i@@ se .
This is a g@@ am@@ er who &apos;s on the ver@@ ge of something called an &quot; e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in . &quot;
Oh , you &apos;ve hear@@ d of that .
OK , good , so we have some g@@ am@@ ers am@@ ong us .
A@@ n e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in is an out@@ come that is so ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ari@@ ly pos@@ iti@@ ve , you had no idea it was even possi@@ ble un@@ ti@@ l you a@@ chi@@ ev@@ ed it .
It was al@@ most be@@ y@@ on@@ d the th@@ res@@ h@@ old of imag@@ in@@ ation , and when you get there , you &apos;re sh@@ oc@@ ked to disc@@ over what you &apos;re tru@@ ly cap@@ able of . That &apos;s an e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in .
This is a g@@ am@@ er on the ver@@ ge of an e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in .
And this is the face that we need to see on mil@@ li@@ ons of problem@@ -@@ sol@@ ver@@ s all over the world as we try to t@@ ac@@ k@@ le the ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les of the next cent@@ ur@@ y -- the face of some@@ one who , ag@@ ain@@ st all o@@ d@@ ds , is on the ver@@ ge of an e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in .
Now , un@@ fort@@ un@@ at@@ ely this is more of the face that we see in every@@ day life now as we try to t@@ ac@@ k@@ le ur@@ g@@ ent problem@@ s .
This is what I call the &quot; I &apos;m N@@ o@@ t G@@ ood A@@ t Li@@ fe &quot; face . This is actually me making it . C@@ an you see ? Y@@ es . G@@ ood .
This is me making the &quot; I &apos;m N@@ o@@ t G@@ ood A@@ t Li@@ fe &quot; face .
This is a pi@@ ece of gr@@ aff@@ iti in my old ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood in B@@ er@@ k@@ el@@ ey , C@@ ali@@ for@@ n@@ ia , where I did my P@@ h@@ D on why we &apos;re better in g@@ am@@ es than we are in real life .
And this is a problem that a lot of g@@ am@@ ers have . We fe@@ el that we are not as good in real@@ ity as we are in g@@ am@@ es .
I don &apos;t mean just good as in succ@@ ess@@ ful , al@@ th@@ ough that &apos;s part of it . We do a@@ chi@@ eve more in g@@ ame wor@@ l@@ ds .
But I also mean good as in mot@@ iv@@ ated to do something that mat@@ ter@@ s -- in@@ spi@@ red to coll@@ abor@@ ate and to c@@ oo@@ per@@ ate .
And when we &apos;re in g@@ ame wor@@ l@@ ds , I believe that many of us be@@ come the b@@ est ver@@ sion of our@@ selves -- the most li@@ k@@ ely to hel@@ p at a mom@@ ent &apos;s not@@ ice , the most li@@ k@@ ely to st@@ ick with a problem as long at it ta@@ kes , to get up after fa@@ il@@ ure and try again .
And in real life , when we face fa@@ il@@ ure , when we con@@ fron@@ t ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les , we o@@ f@@ t@@ en don &apos;t fe@@ el that way . We fe@@ el over@@ come , we fe@@ el over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ed , we fe@@ el an@@ x@@ i@@ ous , ma@@ y@@ be de@@ pr@@ ess@@ ed , fr@@ us@@ tr@@ ated or c@@ y@@ n@@ ical .
We never have those fe@@ el@@ ings when we &apos;re pl@@ aying g@@ am@@ es , they just don &apos;t ex@@ ist in g@@ am@@ es .
So that &apos;s what I wanted to stu@@ dy when I was a gr@@ ad@@ u@@ ate stud@@ ent .
What about g@@ am@@ es ma@@ kes it im@@ possi@@ ble to fe@@ el that we can &apos;t a@@ chi@@ eve everything ?
How can we take those fe@@ el@@ ings from g@@ am@@ es and app@@ ly them to real@@ -@@ world work ?
So I loo@@ ked at g@@ am@@ es like W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ ft , which is really the ide@@ al coll@@ abor@@ ative problem@@ -@@ sol@@ ving en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment .
And I started to not@@ ice a few things that make e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in@@ s so possi@@ ble in on@@ line wor@@ l@@ ds .
The first thing is wh@@ en@@ ever you show up in one of these on@@ line g@@ am@@ es , es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally in W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ ft , there are l@@ ots and l@@ ots of different char@@ ac@@ ter@@ s who are w@@ ill@@ ing to tr@@ ust you with a wor@@ l@@ d@@ -@@ s@@ av@@ ing mis@@ sion , right away .
But not just any mis@@ sion , it &apos;s a mis@@ sion that is per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly mat@@ ch@@ ed with your cur@@ r@@ ent lev@@ el in the g@@ ame .
Ri@@ ght ? So you can do it .
They never give you a ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge you can &apos;t a@@ chi@@ eve .
But it is on the ver@@ ge of what you &apos;re cap@@ able of , so you have to try h@@ ard .
But there &apos;s no un@@ em@@ pl@@ o@@ y@@ ment in W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ ft ; no s@@ itt@@ ing around , wr@@ ing@@ ing your h@@ ands -- there &apos;s always something speci@@ fi@@ c and important to be done .
There are also t@@ ons of coll@@ abor@@ at@@ ors .
E@@ ver@@ y@@ where you go , h@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of thou@@ s@@ ands of people read@@ y to work with you to a@@ chi@@ eve your e@@ pi@@ c mis@@ sion .
That &apos;s not something we have in real life that ea@@ si@@ ly , this sense that at our f@@ ing@@ er@@ ti@@ ps are t@@ ons of coll@@ abor@@ at@@ ors .
And there &apos;s this e@@ pi@@ c story , this in@@ spi@@ r@@ ing story of why we &apos;re there , and what we &apos;re doing ,
and we get all this pos@@ iti@@ ve fe@@ ed@@ back .
You gu@@ ys have hear@@ d of lev@@ el@@ ing up , + 1 str@@ eng@@ th , + 1 intelli@@ gen@@ ce .
We don &apos;t get that kind of con@@ st@@ ant fe@@ ed@@ back in real life .
When I get off this st@@ age , I &apos;m not going to have + 1 spe@@ a@@ king , and + 1 c@@ ra@@ z@@ y idea , + 20 c@@ ra@@ z@@ y idea .
I don &apos;t get that fe@@ ed@@ back in real life .
Now , the problem with coll@@ abor@@ ative on@@ line en@@ vir@@ on@@ m@@ ents like W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ ft is that it &apos;s so s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ying to be on the ver@@ ge of an e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in all the time , we deci@@ de to s@@ pen@@ d all our time in these g@@ ame wor@@ l@@ ds .
It &apos;s just better than real@@ ity .
So , so far , coll@@ ec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y all the W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ ft g@@ am@@ ers have sp@@ ent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years sol@@ ving the vir@@ tu@@ al problem@@ s of A@@ z@@ er@@ ot@@ h .
Now , that &apos;s not nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly a b@@ ad thing .
It might s@@ ound like it &apos;s a b@@ ad thing . But to put that in cont@@ ex@@ t : 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years ago was when our ear@@ li@@ est prim@@ ate human anc@@ est@@ ors st@@ ood up .
That was the first u@@ pr@@ i@@ ght prim@@ ate .
So when we talk about how much time we &apos;re cur@@ r@@ ent@@ ly inv@@ esting in pl@@ aying g@@ am@@ es , the only way it ma@@ kes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de of human evol@@ ution , which is an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary thing . But it &apos;s also ap@@ t , because it tur@@ ns out that by s@@ pen@@ ding all this time pl@@ aying g@@ am@@ es , we &apos;re actually chang@@ ing what we are cap@@ able of as human be@@ ings . We &apos;re evol@@ ving to be a more coll@@ abor@@ ative and hear@@ ty speci@@ es .
This is tru@@ e . I believe this .
So , consi@@ der this really interesting st@@ ati@@ st@@ ic ;
it was rec@@ ent@@ ly pub@@ li@@ sh@@ ed by a res@@ ear@@ ch@@ er at C@@ ar@@ ne@@ gi@@ e M@@ ell@@ on U@@ ni@@ ver@@ s@@ ity :
The aver@@ age y@@ oun@@ g person today in a coun@@ try with a str@@ ong g@@ am@@ er cul@@ ture will have sp@@ ent 1@@ 0@@ ,000 h@@ our@@ s pl@@ aying on@@ line g@@ am@@ es by the age of 2@@ 1 .
Now 1@@ 0@@ ,000 h@@ our@@ s is a really interesting num@@ ber for two reas@@ ons .
F@@ ir@@ st of all , for children in the Un@@ ited St@@ ates , 1@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 8@@ 0 h@@ our@@ s is the ex@@ act am@@ oun@@ t of time you will s@@ pen@@ d in sch@@ ool , from fi@@ f@@ th gr@@ ade to h@@ ig@@ h sch@@ ool gr@@ ad@@ u@@ ation , if you have per@@ f@@ ect at@@ ten@@ d@@ ance .
So , we have an enti@@ re par@@ al@@ le@@ l tr@@ ack of educ@@ ation going on , where y@@ oun@@ g people are lear@@ ning as much about what it ta@@ kes to be a good g@@ am@@ er as they &apos;re lear@@ ning about everything el@@ se in sch@@ ool .
S@@ ome of you have prob@@ ably re@@ ad M@@ al@@ col@@ m G@@ l@@ ad@@ well &apos;s new b@@ ook &quot; O@@ ut@@ li@@ ers , &quot;
so you would have hear@@ d of his the@@ ory of succ@@ ess , the &quot; 1@@ 0@@ ,000 h@@ our@@ s &quot; the@@ ory of succ@@ ess .
It &apos;s bas@@ ed on this great c@@ og@@ n@@ iti@@ ve@@ -@@ sci@@ ence res@@ ear@@ ch that says if we can ma@@ st@@ er 1@@ 0@@ ,000 h@@ our@@ s of ef@@ fort@@ ful stu@@ dy at any@@ thing by the age of 2@@ 1 , we will be vir@@ tu@@ os@@ os at it .
We will be as good at wh@@ at@@ ever we do as the gre@@ at@@ est people in the world .
And so , now what we &apos;re looking at is an enti@@ re gener@@ ation of y@@ oun@@ g people who are vir@@ tu@@ oso g@@ am@@ ers .
So , the big question is , &quot; What ex@@ ac@@ tly are g@@ am@@ ers getting so good at ? &quot;
Because if we could fi@@ g@@ ure that out , we would have a vir@@ tually un@@ pre@@ c@@ ed@@ ent@@ ed human res@@ our@@ ce on our h@@ ands .
This is how many people we now have in the world who s@@ pen@@ d at le@@ ast an h@@ our a day pl@@ aying on@@ line g@@ am@@ es .
Th@@ ese are our vir@@ tu@@ oso g@@ am@@ ers ,
5@@ 00 million people who are ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ari@@ ly good at something .
And in the next de@@ c@@ ade , we &apos;re going to have another bil@@ lion g@@ am@@ ers who are ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ari@@ ly good at wh@@ at@@ ever that is .
If you don &apos;t know it al@@ read@@ y , this is coming . The g@@ ame indus@@ try is devel@@ op@@ ing con@@ sol@@ es that are lo@@ w@@ -@@ energy and that work with the w@@ ir@@ el@@ ess ph@@ one n@@ et@@ wor@@ ks in@@ ste@@ ad of b@@ ro@@ ad@@ b@@ and Inter@@ net , so that g@@ am@@ ers all over the world , partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly in India , Ch@@ ina , B@@ r@@ azi@@ l , can get on@@ line .
They ex@@ p@@ ect one bil@@ lion more g@@ am@@ ers in the next de@@ c@@ ade .
It will br@@ ing us up to 1@@ .@@ 5 bil@@ lion g@@ am@@ ers .
So I &apos;ve started to think about what these g@@ am@@ es are making us vir@@ tu@@ os@@ os at .
Here are the four things I came up with . The first is ur@@ g@@ ent op@@ ti@@ mis@@ m .
OK , think of this as ex@@ tr@@ eme sel@@ f@@ -@@ mot@@ iv@@ ation .
U@@ r@@ g@@ ent op@@ ti@@ mis@@ m is the des@@ ire to act im@@ me@@ di@@ at@@ ely to t@@ ac@@ k@@ le an ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le , com@@ b@@ in@@ ed with the beli@@ e@@ f that we have a reas@@ on@@ able h@@ ope of succ@@ ess .
G@@ am@@ ers always believe that an e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in is possi@@ ble , and that it &apos;s always wor@@ th trying , and trying now .
G@@ am@@ ers don &apos;t si@@ t around .
G@@ am@@ ers are vir@@ tu@@ os@@ os at we@@ av@@ ing a ti@@ ght soci@@ al f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c .
There &apos;s a lot of interesting res@@ ear@@ ch that sho@@ ws we like people better after we play a g@@ ame with them , even if they &apos;ve be@@ at@@ en us b@@ ad@@ ly .
And the reas@@ on is , it ta@@ kes a lot of tr@@ ust to play a g@@ ame with some@@ one . We tr@@ ust that they will s@@ pen@@ d their time with us , that they will play by the same r@@ ul@@ es , val@@ ue the same go@@ al , st@@ ay with the g@@ ame un@@ ti@@ l it &apos;s over .
And so , pl@@ aying a g@@ ame together actually buil@@ ds up b@@ on@@ ds and tr@@ ust and c@@ oo@@ per@@ ation .
And we actually buil@@ d str@@ ong@@ er soci@@ al rel@@ ati@@ on@@ shi@@ ps as a res@@ ul@@ t .
B@@ li@@ s@@ s@@ ful produc@@ ti@@ v@@ ity . I love it .
You know , there &apos;s a reas@@ on why the aver@@ age W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ ft g@@ am@@ er pl@@ ays for 2@@ 2 h@@ our@@ s a we@@ e@@ k -- kind of a hal@@ f@@ -@@ time jo@@ b .
It &apos;s because we know , when we &apos;re pl@@ aying a g@@ ame , that we &apos;re actually hap@@ pi@@ er working h@@ ard than we are rel@@ a@@ x@@ ing , or h@@ ang@@ ing out .
We know that we are op@@ ti@@ mi@@ zed as human be@@ ings , to do h@@ ard and me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful work .
And g@@ am@@ ers are w@@ ill@@ ing to work h@@ ard all the time , if they &apos;re gi@@ v@@ en the right work .
F@@ in@@ ally : e@@ pi@@ c me@@ an@@ ing .
G@@ am@@ ers love to be at@@ ta@@ ch@@ ed to a@@ we@@ -@@ in@@ spi@@ r@@ ing mis@@ si@@ ons to human plan@@ et@@ ar@@ y@@ -@@ sc@@ ale stor@@ ies .
So , just one bit of tri@@ via that hel@@ ps put that into per@@ sp@@ ec@@ tive :
So , you all know W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia , bi@@ gg@@ est wi@@ k@@ i in the world .
S@@ econ@@ d bi@@ gg@@ est wi@@ k@@ i in the world , with ne@@ ar@@ ly 8@@ 0@@ ,000 ar@@ tic@@ les , is the W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ ft wi@@ k@@ i . F@@ i@@ ve million people use it every mon@@ th .
They have com@@ pi@@ l@@ ed more inform@@ ation about W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ ft on the Inter@@ net than any other to@@ pi@@ c c@@ over@@ ed on any other wi@@ k@@ i in the world .
They are building an e@@ pi@@ c story .
They are building an e@@ pi@@ c kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge res@@ our@@ ce about the W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ ft .
O@@ k@@ ay , so these are four super@@ po@@ w@@ ers that ad@@ d up to one thing :
G@@ am@@ ers are super@@ -@@ em@@ po@@ w@@ er@@ ed h@@ op@@ e@@ ful individu@@ als .
Th@@ ese are people who believe that they are individu@@ ally cap@@ able of chang@@ ing the world .
And the only problem is , they believe that they are cap@@ able of chang@@ ing vir@@ tu@@ al wor@@ l@@ ds and not the real world .
That &apos;s the problem that I &apos;m trying to sol@@ ve .
There &apos;s an econom@@ ist n@@ am@@ ed E@@ d@@ w@@ ard C@@ as@@ tr@@ on@@ ov@@ a .
H@@ is work is bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant . He loo@@ ks at why people are inv@@ esting so much time and energy and money in on@@ line wor@@ l@@ ds .
And he says , &quot; We &apos;re w@@ it@@ ness@@ ing what am@@ oun@@ ts to no less than a mas@@ s ex@@ o@@ du@@ s to vir@@ tu@@ al wor@@ l@@ ds and on@@ line g@@ ame en@@ vir@@ on@@ m@@ ents . &quot;
And he &apos;s an econom@@ ist , so he &apos;s r@@ ational . And he says -- N@@ o@@ t like me , I &apos;m a g@@ ame desig@@ ner ; I &apos;m ex@@ u@@ ber@@ ant .
But he says that this ma@@ kes per@@ f@@ ect sense , because g@@ am@@ ers can a@@ chi@@ eve more in on@@ line wor@@ l@@ ds than they can in real life .
They can have str@@ ong@@ er soci@@ al rel@@ ati@@ on@@ shi@@ ps in g@@ am@@ es than they can have in real life ;
they get better fe@@ ed@@ back and fe@@ el more re@@ war@@ ded in g@@ am@@ es than they do in real life .
So he says , for now it ma@@ kes per@@ f@@ ect sense for g@@ am@@ ers to s@@ pen@@ d more time in vir@@ tu@@ al wor@@ l@@ ds than the real world . Now , I also ag@@ ree that that is r@@ ational , for now . But it is not , by any me@@ ans , an op@@ tim@@ al s@@ itu@@ ation . We have to start making the real world work more like a g@@ ame .
I take my in@@ spi@@ r@@ ation from something that happen@@ ed 2@@ ,@@ 5@@ 00 years ago .
Th@@ ese are an@@ ci@@ ent dice , made out of sh@@ e@@ ep &apos;s k@@ n@@ uc@@ k@@ les . Be@@ fore we had aw@@ es@@ ome g@@ ame contr@@ oll@@ ers , we had sh@@ e@@ ep &apos;s k@@ n@@ uc@@ k@@ les . And these re@@ pres@@ ent the first g@@ ame equ@@ i@@ p@@ ment desig@@ ned by human be@@ ings ,
and if you &apos;re fami@@ li@@ ar with the work of the an@@ ci@@ ent G@@ re@@ e@@ k h@@ ist@@ ori@@ an H@@ er@@ o@@ d@@ ot@@ us , you might know this h@@ ist@@ ory ,
which is the h@@ ist@@ ory of who inv@@ ent@@ ed g@@ am@@ es and why .
H@@ er@@ o@@ d@@ ot@@ us says that g@@ am@@ es , partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly dice g@@ am@@ es , were inv@@ ent@@ ed in the k@@ ing@@ do@@ m of L@@ y@@ dia , dur@@ ing a time of fam@@ ine .
A@@ p@@ par@@ ent@@ ly , there was su@@ ch a s@@ ev@@ ere fam@@ ine that the king of L@@ y@@ dia deci@@ ded they had to do something c@@ ra@@ z@@ y .
P@@ e@@ ople were su@@ ff@@ er@@ ing . P@@ e@@ ople were fi@@ gh@@ ting . It was an ex@@ tr@@ eme s@@ itu@@ ation , they ne@@ e@@ ded an ex@@ tr@@ eme sol@@ ution .
So , ac@@ cor@@ ding to H@@ er@@ o@@ d@@ ot@@ us , they inv@@ ent@@ ed dice g@@ am@@ es , and they se@@ t up a k@@ ing@@ dom@@ -@@ wi@@ de pol@@ ic@@ y :
O@@ n one day , every@@ body would e@@ at ,
and on the next day , every@@ body would play g@@ am@@ es .
And they would be so im@@ mer@@ s@@ ed in pl@@ aying the dice g@@ am@@ es , because g@@ am@@ es are so eng@@ ag@@ ing , and im@@ mer@@ se us in su@@ ch s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ying , b@@ li@@ s@@ s@@ ful produc@@ ti@@ v@@ ity , they would ig@@ n@@ ore the fact that they had no f@@ ood to e@@ at .
And then on the next day , they would play g@@ am@@ es ; and on the next day , they would e@@ at .
And ac@@ cor@@ ding to H@@ er@@ o@@ d@@ ot@@ us , they pass@@ ed 1@@ 8 years this way , sur@@ viv@@ ing through a fam@@ ine , by e@@ ating on one day , and pl@@ aying g@@ am@@ es on the next .
Now , this is ex@@ ac@@ tly , I think , how we &apos;re using g@@ am@@ es today . We &apos;re using g@@ am@@ es to es@@ cap@@ e real@@ -@@ world su@@ ff@@ er@@ ing --
we &apos;re using g@@ am@@ es to get away
from everything that &apos;s b@@ ro@@ k@@ en in the real en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment , everything that &apos;s not s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ying about real life , and we &apos;re getting what we need from g@@ am@@ es .
But it doesn &apos;t have to end there .
This is really exc@@ it@@ ing . A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to H@@ er@@ o@@ d@@ ot@@ us , after 1@@ 8 years the fam@@ ine w@@ as@@ n &apos;t getting better , so the king deci@@ ded they would play one fin@@ al dice g@@ ame .
They divi@@ ded the enti@@ re k@@ ing@@ do@@ m in hal@@ f . They pl@@ ay@@ ed one dice g@@ ame , and the w@@ inn@@ ers of that g@@ ame got to go on an e@@ pi@@ c ad@@ vent@@ ure .
They would le@@ ave L@@ y@@ dia , and they would go out in se@@ ar@@ ch of a new place to live , le@@ av@@ ing be@@ h@@ in@@ d just enough people to sur@@ vi@@ ve on the res@@ our@@ ces that were av@@ a@@ il@@ able , and h@@ op@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly to take their ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation some@@ where el@@ se where they could th@@ ri@@ ve .
Now , this s@@ oun@@ ds c@@ ra@@ z@@ y , right ?
But rec@@ ent@@ ly , D@@ N@@ A ev@@ id@@ ence has sho@@ wn that the E@@ tr@@ us@@ can@@ s , who then l@@ ed to the R@@ om@@ an E@@ m@@ pi@@ re , actually sh@@ are the same D@@ N@@ A as the an@@ ci@@ ent L@@ y@@ di@@ ans .
And so , rec@@ ent@@ ly , scienti@@ st@@ s have su@@ gg@@ es@@ ted that H@@ er@@ o@@ d@@ ot@@ us &apos; c@@ ra@@ z@@ y story is actually tru@@ e .
And ge@@ olog@@ ist@@ s have found ev@@ id@@ ence of a glob@@ al co@@ ol@@ ing that l@@ ast@@ ed for ne@@ ar@@ ly 20 years , that could have expl@@ ain@@ ed the fam@@ ine .
So this c@@ ra@@ z@@ y story might be tru@@ e . They might have actually s@@ av@@ ed their cul@@ ture by pl@@ aying g@@ am@@ es , es@@ cap@@ ing to g@@ am@@ es for 1@@ 8 years , and then been so in@@ spi@@ red , and k@@ new so much about how to come together with g@@ am@@ es , that they actually s@@ av@@ ed the enti@@ re ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation that way .
O@@ k@@ ay , we can do that .
We &apos;ve been pl@@ aying W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ ft sin@@ ce 19@@ 9@@ 4 .
That was the first real@@ -@@ time str@@ at@@ eg@@ y g@@ ame from the W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ ft ser@@ ies . That was 1@@ 6 years ago .
They pl@@ ay@@ ed dice g@@ am@@ es for 1@@ 8 years , we &apos;ve been pl@@ aying W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ ft for 1@@ 6 years .
I say we are read@@ y for our own e@@ pi@@ c g@@ ame .
Now , they had hal@@ f the ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation go off in se@@ ar@@ ch of a new world ,
so that &apos;s where I get my 2@@ 1 bil@@ lion h@@ our@@ s a we@@ e@@ k of g@@ am@@ e-@@ play from .
L@@ et &apos;s get hal@@ f of us to ag@@ ree to s@@ pen@@ d an h@@ our a day pl@@ aying g@@ am@@ es , un@@ ti@@ l we sol@@ ve real@@ -@@ world problem@@ s .
Now , I know you &apos;re as@@ king , &quot; How are we going to sol@@ ve real@@ -@@ world problem@@ s in g@@ am@@ es ? &quot; Well , that &apos;s what I &apos;ve dev@@ ot@@ ed my work to over the pas@@ t few years , at the In@@ st@@ itu@@ te for the F@@ ut@@ ure .
We have this b@@ an@@ ner in our off@@ ic@@ es in P@@ al@@ o Al@@ to , and it ex@@ pr@@ ess@@ es our vie@@ w of how we should try to rel@@ ate to the fut@@ ure .
We do not want to try to pre@@ dic@@ t the fut@@ ure .
What we want to do is make the fut@@ ure .
We want to imag@@ ine the b@@ est@@ -@@ cas@@ e sc@@ en@@ ario out@@ come , and then we want to em@@ power people to make that out@@ come a real@@ ity .
We want to imag@@ ine e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in@@ s , and then give people the me@@ ans to a@@ chi@@ eve the e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in .
I &apos;m just going to very bri@@ ef@@ ly show you three g@@ am@@ es that I &apos;ve made that are an att@@ em@@ pt to give people the me@@ ans to create e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in@@ s in their own fut@@ u@@ res .
This is W@@ or@@ ld W@@ i@@ th@@ out O@@ il .
We made this g@@ ame in 200@@ 7 .
This is an on@@ line g@@ ame in which you try to sur@@ vi@@ ve an o@@ il sh@@ or@@ t@@ age .
The o@@ il sh@@ or@@ t@@ age is fic@@ ti@@ onal , but we put enough on@@ line cont@@ ent out there for you to believe that it &apos;s real , and to live your real life as if we &apos;ve r@@ un out of o@@ il . So when you come to the g@@ ame , you sig@@ n up , tell us where you live , and then we give you real@@ -@@ time ne@@ ws vide@@ os , data fe@@ ed@@ s that show you ex@@ ac@@ tly how much o@@ il cos@@ ts , what &apos;s not av@@ a@@ il@@ able , how f@@ ood sup@@ p@@ ly is being aff@@ ec@@ ted ,
how trans@@ port@@ ation is being aff@@ ec@@ ted , if sch@@ o@@ ol@@ s are cl@@ os@@ ed , if there &apos;s ri@@ ot@@ ing , and you have to fi@@ g@@ ure out how you would live your real life as if this were tru@@ e . And then we as@@ k you to b@@ lo@@ g about it , to pos@@ t vide@@ os , to pos@@ t ph@@ ot@@ os .
We pi@@ l@@ ot@@ ed this g@@ ame with 1@@ ,@@ 7@@ 00 pl@@ ay@@ ers in 200@@ 7 , and we &apos;ve tr@@ ac@@ ked them for the three years sin@@ ce . And I can tell you that this is a trans@@ form@@ ative ex@@ peri@@ ence .
N@@ o@@ body wan@@ ts to change how they live , just because it &apos;s good for the world , or because we &apos;re sup@@ pos@@ ed to .
But if you im@@ mer@@ se them in an e@@ pi@@ c ad@@ vent@@ ure and tell them , &quot; We &apos;ve r@@ un out of o@@ il .
This is an am@@ az@@ ing story and ad@@ vent@@ ure for you to go on .
Ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge y@@ our@@ self to see how you would sur@@ vi@@ ve , &quot;
most of our pl@@ ay@@ ers have ke@@ pt up the h@@ ab@@ its that they lear@@ ned in this g@@ ame .
So for the next wor@@ l@@ d@@ -@@ s@@ av@@ ing g@@ ame , we deci@@ ded to ai@@ m hi@@ gh@@ er -- bi@@ gg@@ er problem than just pe@@ a@@ k o@@ il .
We did a g@@ ame called Su@@ per@@ struc@@ t at the In@@ st@@ itu@@ te for the F@@ ut@@ ure . And the pre@@ mi@@ se was , a super@@ computer has c@@ alc@@ ul@@ ated that hum@@ ans have only 2@@ 3 years le@@ ft on the plan@@ et .
This super@@ computer was called the G@@ lob@@ al E@@ x@@ t@@ inc@@ tion A@@ war@@ en@@ ess S@@ y@@ stem , of course .
We as@@ ked people to come on@@ line -- al@@ most like a J@@ er@@ ry B@@ r@@ uc@@ k@@ he@@ im@@ er mov@@ ie .
You know J@@ er@@ ry B@@ r@@ uc@@ k@@ he@@ im@@ er mov@@ ies , you form a dre@@ am te@@ am -- you &apos;ve got the as@@ tr@@ on@@ a@@ ut , the scienti@@ st , the ex@@ -@@ con@@ vic@@ t , and they all have something to do to s@@ ave the world . But in our g@@ ame , in@@ ste@@ ad of just hav@@ ing fi@@ ve people on the dre@@ am te@@ am , we said , &quot; E@@ ver@@ y@@ body &apos;s on the dre@@ am te@@ am , and it &apos;s your jo@@ b to inv@@ ent the fut@@ ure of energy , the fut@@ ure of f@@ ood , the fut@@ ure of he@@ al@@ th , the fut@@ ure of sec@@ ur@@ ity and the fut@@ ure of the soci@@ al s@@ af@@ et@@ y net . &quot;
We had 8@@ ,000 people play that g@@ ame for ei@@ ght we@@ e@@ ks . They came up with 5@@ 00 in@@ s@@ an@@ ely cre@@ ative sol@@ u@@ tions that you can go on@@ line , G@@ o@@ og@@ le &quot; Su@@ per@@ struc@@ t , &quot; and see .
So , fin@@ ally , the last g@@ ame , we &apos;re la@@ un@@ ch@@ ing it Mar@@ ch 3@@ r@@ d . This is a g@@ ame done with the W@@ or@@ ld B@@ ank In@@ st@@ itu@@ te .
If you compl@@ ete the g@@ ame , you will be cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ ed by the W@@ or@@ ld B@@ ank In@@ st@@ itu@@ te as a S@@ o@@ ci@@ al In@@ n@@ ov@@ at@@ or , c@@ las@@ s of 20@@ 10 .
W@@ or@@ king with univer@@ s@@ ities all over sub@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ har@@ an Africa , and we are inv@@ it@@ ing them to lear@@ n soci@@ al inn@@ ov@@ ation sk@@ ill@@ s .
We &apos;ve got a gr@@ ap@@ hi@@ c n@@ ov@@ el , we &apos;ve got lev@@ el@@ ing up in sk@@ ill@@ s like loc@@ al insi@@ ght , kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge n@@ et@@ working , su@@ st@@ ain@@ abil@@ ity , vi@@ sion and res@@ our@@ c@@ ef@@ ul@@ ness .
I would like to inv@@ ite all of you to pl@@ e@@ ase sh@@ are this g@@ ame with y@@ oun@@ g people , any@@ where in the world , partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly in devel@@ op@@ ing ar@@ e@@ as , who might ben@@ ef@@ it from coming together to try to start to imag@@ ine their own soci@@ al en@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ es to s@@ ave the world .
So , I &apos;m going to w@@ ra@@ p up now .
I want to as@@ k a question .
What do you think happen@@ s next ?
We &apos;ve got all these am@@ az@@ ing g@@ am@@ ers , we &apos;ve got these g@@ am@@ es that are kind of pi@@ l@@ ots of what we might do , but n@@ one of them have s@@ av@@ ed the real world y@@ et .
Well I h@@ ope you will ag@@ ree with me that g@@ am@@ ers are a human res@@ our@@ ce that we can use to do real@@ -@@ world work , that g@@ am@@ es are a po@@ w@@ er@@ ful pl@@ at@@ form for change . We have all these am@@ az@@ ing super@@ po@@ w@@ ers : b@@ li@@ s@@ s@@ ful produc@@ ti@@ v@@ ity , the abil@@ ity to we@@ ave a ti@@ ght soci@@ al f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c , this fe@@ el@@ ing of ur@@ g@@ ent op@@ ti@@ mis@@ m and the des@@ ire for e@@ pi@@ c me@@ an@@ ing .
I really h@@ ope that we can come together to play g@@ am@@ es that matt@@ er , to sur@@ vi@@ ve on this plan@@ et for another cent@@ ur@@ y . That &apos;s my h@@ ope , that you will jo@@ in me in making and pl@@ aying g@@ am@@ es like this .
When I look for@@ w@@ ard to the next de@@ c@@ ade , I know two things for s@@ ure : that we can make any fut@@ ure we can imag@@ ine , and we can play any g@@ am@@ es we want , so I say :
L@@ et the wor@@ l@@ d@@ -@@ chang@@ ing g@@ am@@ es beg@@ in .
Thank you .
F@@ or some time I have been inter@@ es@@ ted in the pl@@ ac@@ eb@@ o eff@@ ect , which might se@@ e@@ m like an o@@ d@@ d thing for a mag@@ ici@@ an to be inter@@ es@@ ted in , un@@ less you think of it in the ter@@ ms that I do , which is , &quot; S@@ om@@ e@@ thing fa@@ ke is beli@@ ev@@ ed in enough by som@@ eb@@ o@@ dy that it be@@ comes something real . &quot; In other wor@@ ds , su@@ g@@ ar pi@@ l@@ ls have a me@@ as@@ ur@@ able eff@@ ect in cer@@ ta@@ in kin@@ ds of stu@@ di@@ es , the pl@@ ac@@ eb@@ o eff@@ ect , just because the person thin@@ ks
that what &apos;s happen@@ ing to them is a ph@@ ar@@ mac@@ e@@ ut@@ ical or some sort of a --
for p@@ ain man@@ ag@@ ement , for example , if they believe it enough there is a me@@ as@@ ur@@ able eff@@ ect in the body called the pl@@ ac@@ eb@@ o eff@@ ect .
S@@ om@@ e@@ thing fa@@ ke be@@ comes something real because of some@@ one &apos;s perc@@ ep@@ tion of it .
In ord@@ er for us to understand each other , I want to start by sho@@ wing you a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary , very sim@@ ple mag@@ ic tr@@ ick .
And I &apos;m going to show you how it wor@@ ks . This is a tr@@ ick that &apos;s been in every children &apos;s mag@@ ic b@@ ook sin@@ ce at le@@ ast the 19@@ 5@@ 0@@ s .
I lear@@ ned it m@@ y@@ self from C@@ u@@ b S@@ c@@ out M@@ ag@@ ic in the 19@@ 7@@ 0@@ s .
I &apos;ll do it for you , and then I &apos;ll expl@@ ain it .
And then I &apos;ll expl@@ ain why I expl@@ ain@@ ed it .
So , here &apos;s what happen@@ s .
The k@@ ni@@ fe , which you can exam@@ ine ; my h@@ and , which you could exam@@ ine .
I &apos;m just going to h@@ old the k@@ ni@@ fe in my fi@@ st like this .
I &apos;ll get my s@@ le@@ eve back .
And to make s@@ ure no@@ thing go@@ es up or down my s@@ le@@ eve
I &apos;m just going to s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ ze my w@@ ri@@ st right here .
That way you can see that at no time can any@@ thing tr@@ av@@ el , as long as I &apos;m s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ z@@ ing there no@@ thing can go up or down my s@@ le@@ eve .
And the ob@@ ject of this is quite sim@@ ple .
I &apos;m going to op@@ en my h@@ and , and h@@ op@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly , if all is well , my p@@ ure anim@@ al mag@@ ne@@ ti@@ s@@ m will h@@ old the k@@ ni@@ fe .
In fact it &apos;s hel@@ d so ti@@ gh@@ tly in place that I can sh@@ a@@ ke it , and the k@@ ni@@ fe does not come off .
N@@ o@@ thing go@@ es up or down my s@@ le@@ eve ,
no tr@@ ic@@ k@@ er@@ y . And you can exam@@ ine everything .
T@@ a@@ -@@ da !
So , this is a tr@@ ick that I o@@ f@@ t@@ en te@@ ach to y@@ oun@@ g children
that are inter@@ es@@ ted in mag@@ ic , because you can lear@@ n a great de@@ al about de@@ c@@ ep@@ tion by stud@@ ying this very -- even th@@ ough it &apos;s a very sim@@ ple tr@@ ick me@@ th@@ o@@ d@@ olog@@ ically .
P@@ ro@@ b@@ ably many of you in the ro@@ om know this tr@@ ick .
What happen@@ s is this . I h@@ old the k@@ ni@@ fe in my h@@ and .
I say I &apos;m going to gra@@ b h@@ old of my w@@ ri@@ st
to make s@@ ure no@@ thing go@@ es up or down my s@@ le@@ eve , that is a li@@ e .
The reas@@ on I &apos;m h@@ ol@@ ding on@@ to my w@@ ri@@ st is because that &apos;s actually the sec@@ re@@ t of the il@@ lu@@ sion .
In a mom@@ ent when my h@@ and mov@@ es from fac@@ ing you to being away from you , this f@@ ing@@ er right here , my in@@ de@@ x f@@ ing@@ er is just going to shi@@ ft from where it is , to a pos@@ ition po@@ in@@ ting out like this . N@@ ice one .
S@@ om@@ e@@ one who didn &apos;t have a chil@@ d@@ h@@ ood is out there .
So , it go@@ es like this , from here , right .
And as I m@@ ove around my f@@ ing@@ er shi@@ f@@ ts .
And we could talk about why this is de@@ c@@ ep@@ tive , why you don &apos;t not@@ ice there are only three f@@ ing@@ ers down here , because the min@@ d , and the way it proc@@ ess@@ es inform@@ ation , it doesn &apos;t coun@@ t , one , two , three . It gr@@ ou@@ ps them .
But that &apos;s not really what this is about . Ri@@ ght ? And then I op@@ en my h@@ and up . O@@ b@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly it &apos;s cl@@ ing@@ ing there , not by anim@@ al mag@@ ne@@ ti@@ s@@ m , but by ch@@ ic@@ an@@ er@@ y , my in@@ de@@ x f@@ ing@@ er being there .
And then when I cl@@ ose my f@@ ing@@ er , same thing , as I m@@ ove back , this mot@@ i@@ on kind of c@@ ov@@ ers the mov@@ ing back of my f@@ ing@@ er .
I take this h@@ and away . You give the k@@ ni@@ fe out .
There is a tr@@ ick you can do for your fri@@ en@@ ds and ne@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ ors . Th@@ an@@ ks .
Now , what does that have to do with the pl@@ ac@@ eb@@ o eff@@ ect ?
I re@@ ad a stu@@ dy a year or so ago that really b@@ le@@ w my min@@ d wi@@ de op@@ en .
I &apos;m not a d@@ oc@@ t@@ or or a res@@ ear@@ ch@@ er , so this , to me , was an ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ ing thing .
It tur@@ ns out that if you ad@@ min@@ ist@@ er a pl@@ ac@@ eb@@ o in the form of a wh@@ ite pi@@ ll , that &apos;s like as@@ pi@@ r@@ in sh@@ ap@@ ed -- it &apos;s just a r@@ ound wh@@ ite pi@@ ll -- it has some cer@@ ta@@ in me@@ as@@ ur@@ able eff@@ ect .
But if you change the form that you give the pl@@ ac@@ eb@@ o in , like you make a sm@@ all@@ er pi@@ ll , and col@@ or it bl@@ ue , and st@@ am@@ p a l@@ etter into it , it is actually me@@ as@@ ur@@ ably more eff@@ ec@@ tive .
E@@ v@@ en th@@ ough ne@@ i@@ ther one of these things has any ph@@ ar@@ mac@@ e@@ ut@@ ical -- they &apos;re su@@ g@@ ar pi@@ l@@ ls .
But a wh@@ ite pi@@ ll is not as good as a bl@@ ue pi@@ ll .
What ? That really f@@ li@@ p@@ p@@ ed me out .
T@@ ur@@ ns out th@@ ough , that that &apos;s not even where it st@@ op@@ s .
If you have cap@@ sul@@ es , they &apos;re more eff@@ ec@@ tive than t@@ ab@@ l@@ ets in any form .
A col@@ or@@ ed cap@@ su@@ le , that &apos;s y@@ el@@ low on one end and red on the other is better than a wh@@ ite cap@@ su@@ le .
D@@ os@@ age has something to do with this .
One pi@@ ll tw@@ ice a day is not as good at three pi@@ l@@ ls -- I don &apos;t re@@ mem@@ ber the st@@ ati@@ st@@ ic now . S@@ or@@ ry .
But the point is ...
... these d@@ os@@ ag@@ es have something to do with it .
And the form has something to do with it .
And if you want the ul@@ tim@@ ate in pl@@ ac@@ eb@@ o , you &apos;ve go to the ne@@ ed@@ le .
Ri@@ ght ? A sy@@ r@@ ing@@ e with some in@@ er@@ t -- a cou@@ ple C@@ C@@ s of some in@@ er@@ t something ,
and you in@@ ject this into a p@@ ati@@ ent ...
Well this is su@@ ch a po@@ w@@ er@@ ful im@@ age in their min@@ d , it &apos;s so much str@@ ong@@ er than the wh@@ ite pi@@ ll .
It &apos;s a really , this gr@@ ap@@ h , well I &apos;ll show it to you some other time when we have s@@ li@@ de@@ s .
The point is the wh@@ ite pi@@ ll is not as good as the bl@@ ue pi@@ ll is not as good as the cap@@ su@@ le is not as good as the ne@@ ed@@ le .
And n@@ one of it has any real ph@@ ar@@ mac@@ e@@ ut@@ ical qual@@ ity ,
it &apos;s only your beli@@ e@@ f that ma@@ kes it real in your body and ma@@ kes a str@@ ong@@ er eff@@ ect .
I wanted to see if I could take that idea and app@@ ly it to a mag@@ ic tr@@ ick .
And take something that is ob@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly a fa@@ ke tr@@ ick and make it se@@ e@@ m real .
And we know from that stu@@ dy that when you want real@@ ity , you go to the ne@@ ed@@ le .
This is a s@@ ev@@ en@@ -@@ in@@ ch h@@ at@@ p@@ in . It &apos;s very , very sh@@ ar@@ p ,
and I &apos;m going to just st@@ eri@@ li@@ ze it a t@@ in@@ y bit .
This is really my fl@@ es@@ h . This is not D@@ am@@ i@@ an &apos;s speci@@ al@@ -@@ gro@@ wn fl@@ es@@ h .
That &apos;s my sk@@ in right there . This is not a H@@ oll@@ y@@ w@@ ood speci@@ al eff@@ ect .
I &apos;m going to pi@@ er@@ ce my sk@@ in and r@@ un this ne@@ ed@@ le through to the other side .
If you &apos;re qu@@ e@@ as@@ y -- if you f@@ ain@@ t ea@@ si@@ ly -- I was doing this for some fri@@ en@@ ds in the h@@ ot@@ el ro@@ om last ni@@ ght , and some people that I didn &apos;t know , and one wom@@ an al@@ most pass@@ ed out .
So , I su@@ gg@@ est if you get qu@@ e@@ as@@ y e@@ as@@ y that you look away for about the next 30 -- in fact , you know what , I &apos;ll do the first b@@ ad part be@@ h@@ in@@ d it .
You &apos;ll get to see , you can look away too if you &apos;d like to .
So , here is what happen@@ s , right here , the beg@@ in@@ ning of my fl@@ es@@ h at the lo@@ wer part of my ar@@ m I just make a little pi@@ er@@ ce .
I &apos;m sor@@ ry , man . A@@ m I fre@@ a@@ king you out ?
OK , and then just through my sk@@ in a t@@ in@@ y bit , and then out the other side like this .
Now , ess@@ enti@@ ally we &apos;re in the same pos@@ ition we were in with the k@@ ni@@ fe tr@@ ick .
S@@ or@@ t of . But you can &apos;t coun@@ t my f@@ ing@@ ers right now can you ?
So , let me show them to you . That &apos;s one , two three , four , fi@@ ve . Y@@ es , well ...
I know what people think when they see this .
They go , &quot; Well , he &apos;s cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly not d@@ um@@ b enough to st@@ a@@ b h@@ im@@ self through the sk@@ in to en@@ ter@@ ta@@ in us for a few min@@ ut@@ es .
So , let me give you a little pe@@ e@@ k .
How &apos;s that look out there ? P@@ ret@@ ty good .
Y@@ ea@@ h , I know . And the people in the back go , &quot; OK , I didn &apos;t really see that . &quot;
P@@ e@@ ople in the s@@ at@@ ell@@ ite ro@@ om are star@@ ting to m@@ ove in now .
L@@ et me give you good cl@@ ose look at this .
That really is my sk@@ in . That is not a H@@ oll@@ y@@ w@@ ood speci@@ al eff@@ ect .
That &apos;s my fl@@ es@@ h , and I can tw@@ ist that around .
I &apos;m sor@@ ry . If you &apos;re getting qu@@ e@@ as@@ y , look away , don &apos;t look at the thing .
P@@ e@@ ople in the back or people on video years from now w@@ at@@ ch@@ ing this will go , &quot; Well ye@@ a@@ h , that loo@@ ks kind of ne@@ at in some sort of eff@@ ect there , but if it were real he would be --
see there &apos;s a h@@ ole there and a h@@ ole there , if it were real he would be b@@ le@@ ed@@ ing .
Well let me work up some b@@ loo@@ d for you .
Y@@ es , there it is .
N@@ or@@ m@@ ally now , I would take the ne@@ ed@@ le out .
I would c@@ le@@ an off my ar@@ m , and I would show you that there are no w@@ oun@@ ds .
But I think in this cont@@ ex@@ t and with the idea of ta@@ king something fa@@ ke and making it into something real , I &apos;m just going to le@@ ave it there , and w@@ alk off the st@@ age .
I will be se@@ e@@ ing you s@@ ever@@ al times over the next few d@@ ays . I h@@ ope you &apos;re looking for@@ w@@ ard to that . Thank you very much .
So , I &apos;ve kno@@ wn a lot of fis@@ h in my life .
I &apos;ve l@@ ov@@ ed only two .
That first one , it was more like a pas@@ si@@ on@@ ate aff@@ air .
It was a be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful fis@@ h : f@@ lavor@@ ful , t@@ ex@@ tu@@ red , me@@ at@@ y , a b@@ est@@ sel@@ l@@ er on the men@@ u .
What a fis@@ h .
E@@ v@@ en better , it was far@@ m@@ -@@ ra@@ is@@ ed to the sup@@ pos@@ ed hi@@ gh@@ est st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds of su@@ st@@ ain@@ abil@@ ity .
So you could fe@@ el good about sel@@ ling it .
I was in a rel@@ ati@@ on@@ shi@@ p with this be@@ aut@@ y for s@@ ever@@ al mon@@ th@@ s .
One day , the he@@ ad of the comp@@ any called and as@@ ked if I &apos;d spe@@ a@@ k at an ev@@ ent about the far@@ m &apos;s su@@ st@@ ain@@ abil@@ ity .
&quot; A@@ b@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely , &quot; I said .
Here was a comp@@ any trying to sol@@ ve what &apos;s be@@ come this un@@ imag@@ in@@ able problem for us ch@@ ef@@ s :
How do we ke@@ ep fis@@ h on our men@@ us ?
F@@ or the pas@@ t 50 years , we &apos;ve been fi@@ sh@@ ing the se@@ as like we c@@ lear@@ -@@ c@@ ut for@@ es@@ ts .
It &apos;s h@@ ard to over@@ state the des@@ tr@@ uc@@ tion .
N@@ in@@ et@@ y percent of lar@@ ge fis@@ h , the ones we love -- the t@@ un@@ as , the h@@ ali@@ b@@ ut@@ s , the sal@@ mon@@ s , s@@ wor@@ d@@ fis@@ h -- they &apos;ve coll@@ ap@@ s@@ ed .
There &apos;s al@@ most no@@ thing le@@ ft .
So , for better or for wor@@ se , a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture , fis@@ h far@@ m@@ ing , is going to be a part of our fut@@ ure .
A lot of ar@@ g@@ um@@ ents ag@@ ain@@ st it :
F@@ is@@ h far@@ ms pol@@ lu@@ te -- most of them do any@@ way -- and they &apos;re in@@ eff@@ ici@@ ent . T@@ a@@ ke t@@ una ,
a ma@@ j@@ or d@@ ra@@ w@@ back . It &apos;s got a fe@@ ed con@@ ver@@ sion r@@ ati@@ o of 1@@ 5 to one .
That me@@ ans it ta@@ kes fi@@ f@@ te@@ en p@@ oun@@ ds of w@@ il@@ d fis@@ h to get you one p@@ ound of far@@ m t@@ una .
N@@ o@@ t very su@@ st@@ ain@@ able .
It doesn &apos;t tast@@ e very good ei@@ ther .
So here , fin@@ ally , was a comp@@ any trying to do it right .
I wanted to sup@@ por@@ t them .
The day before the ev@@ ent , I called the he@@ ad of P@@ .@@ R@@ . for the comp@@ any .
L@@ et &apos;s call him D@@ on .
&quot; D@@ on , &quot; I said , &quot; just to get the fac@@ ts str@@ ai@@ ght , you gu@@ ys are fam@@ ous for far@@ m@@ ing so far out to se@@ a , you don &apos;t pol@@ lu@@ te . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s right , &quot; he said . &quot; We &apos;re so far out , the w@@ ast@@ e from our fis@@ h g@@ ets distr@@ i@@ b@@ ut@@ ed , not conc@@ entr@@ ated . &quot;
And then he ad@@ ded , &quot; We &apos;re bas@@ ically a world un@@ to our@@ selves .
That fe@@ ed con@@ ver@@ sion r@@ ati@@ o ? 2@@ .@@ 5 to one , &quot; he said .
&quot; B@@ est in the bus@@ iness . &quot;
2@@ .@@ 5 to one , great .
&quot; 2@@ .@@ 5 what ? What are you fe@@ ed@@ ing ? &quot;
&quot; Su@@ st@@ ain@@ able prot@@ e@@ in@@ s , &quot; he said .
&quot; G@@ re@@ at , &quot; I said . G@@ o@@ t off the ph@@ one .
And that ni@@ ght , I was l@@ ying in b@@ ed , and I thought : What the h@@ ell is a su@@ st@@ ain@@ able prot@@ e@@ in ?
So the next day , just before the ev@@ ent , I called D@@ on .
I said , &quot; D@@ on , what are some exam@@ pl@@ es of su@@ st@@ ain@@ able prot@@ e@@ in@@ s ? &quot;
He said he didn &apos;t know . He would as@@ k around .
Well , I got on the ph@@ one with a few people in the comp@@ any ; no one could give me a str@@ ai@@ ght ans@@ wer
un@@ ti@@ l fin@@ ally , I got on the ph@@ one with the he@@ ad biolog@@ ist .
L@@ et &apos;s call him D@@ on too .
&quot; D@@ on , &quot; I said , &quot; what are some exam@@ pl@@ es of su@@ st@@ ain@@ able prot@@ e@@ in@@ s ? &quot;
Well , he men@@ ti@@ on@@ ed some al@@ g@@ a@@ es and some fis@@ h me@@ als , and then he said ch@@ ic@@ k@@ en p@@ ell@@ ets .
I said , &quot; Ch@@ ic@@ k@@ en p@@ ell@@ ets ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Y@@ ea@@ h , fe@@ a@@ th@@ ers , sk@@ in , b@@ one me@@ al , sc@@ rap@@ s , d@@ ri@@ ed and proc@@ ess@@ ed into fe@@ ed . &quot;
I said , &quot; What perc@@ ent@@ age of your fe@@ ed is ch@@ ic@@ k@@ en ? &quot;
Th@@ in@@ king , you know , two percent .
&quot; Well , it &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
I said , &quot; D@@ on , what &apos;s su@@ st@@ ain@@ able about fe@@ ed@@ ing ch@@ ic@@ k@@ en to fis@@ h ? &quot;
There was a long p@@ ause on the line , and he said , &quot; There &apos;s just too much ch@@ ic@@ k@@ en in the world . &quot;
I f@@ ell out of love with this fis@@ h .
No , not because I &apos;m some sel@@ f@@ -@@ ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous , go@@ o@@ d@@ y@@ -@@ two sho@@ es f@@ oo@@ di@@ e .
I actually am .
No , I actually f@@ ell out of love with this fis@@ h because , I s@@ we@@ ar to G@@ od , after that con@@ ver@@ s@@ ation , the fis@@ h tast@@ ed like ch@@ ic@@ k@@ en .
This secon@@ d fis@@ h , it &apos;s a different kind of love story .
It &apos;s the r@@ om@@ anti@@ c kind , the kind where the more you get to know your fis@@ h , you love the fis@@ h .
I first ate it at a res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ant in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n S@@ p@@ ain .
A j@@ our@@ n@@ al@@ ist fri@@ end had been tal@@ king about this fis@@ h for a long time .
S@@ he kind of se@@ t us up .
It came to the t@@ able a b@@ right , al@@ most sh@@ im@@ mer@@ ing , wh@@ ite col@@ or .
The ch@@ e@@ f had over@@ c@@ oo@@ ked it .
Li@@ ke tw@@ ice over .
A@@ ma@@ z@@ ing@@ ly , it was still del@@ ici@@ ous .
W@@ ho can make a fis@@ h tast@@ e good after it &apos;s been over@@ c@@ oo@@ ked ?
I can &apos;t , but this gu@@ y can .
L@@ et &apos;s call him M@@ i@@ gu@@ el --
actually his n@@ ame is M@@ i@@ gu@@ el .
And no , he didn &apos;t c@@ ook the fis@@ h , and he &apos;s not a ch@@ e@@ f ,
at le@@ ast in the way that you and I understand it .
He &apos;s a biolog@@ ist at V@@ eta La P@@ al@@ ma . It &apos;s a fis@@ h far@@ m in the s@@ ou@@ th@@ w@@ es@@ ter@@ n cor@@ ner of S@@ p@@ ain . It &apos;s at the ti@@ p of the G@@ u@@ ad@@ al@@ qu@@ i@@ vi@@ r riv@@ er .
Un@@ ti@@ l the 19@@ 8@@ 0@@ s , the far@@ m was in the h@@ ands of the Ar@@ g@@ ent@@ in@@ i@@ ans .
They ra@@ is@@ ed be@@ e@@ f c@@ att@@ le on what was ess@@ enti@@ ally w@@ et@@ l@@ ands .
They did it by d@@ ra@@ in@@ ing the land . They buil@@ t this in@@ tr@@ ic@@ ate ser@@ ies of can@@ als , and they p@@ us@@ h@@ ed water off the land and out into the riv@@ er .
Well , they cou@@ ldn &apos;t make it work , not econom@@ ically .
And ec@@ olog@@ ically , it was a dis@@ ast@@ er .
It k@@ ill@@ ed like 9@@ 0 percent of the bi@@ r@@ ds , which , for this place , is a lot of bi@@ r@@ ds .
And so in 19@@ 8@@ 2 , a S@@ pan@@ is@@ h comp@@ any with an en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment@@ al con@@ sci@@ ence p@@ ur@@ ch@@ as@@ ed the land .
What did they do ?
They re@@ ver@@ s@@ ed the f@@ low of water .
They l@@ it@@ er@@ ally f@@ li@@ p@@ p@@ ed the s@@ w@@ it@@ ch .
In@@ ste@@ ad of p@@ us@@ h@@ ing water out , they used the chan@@ nel@@ s to p@@ ul@@ l water back in .
They f@@ loo@@ ded the can@@ als .
They cre@@ ated a 2@@ 7@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ ac@@ re fis@@ h far@@ m -- bas@@ s , m@@ ul@@ let , sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p , e@@ el -- and in the proc@@ ess , M@@ i@@ gu@@ el and this comp@@ any complet@@ ely re@@ ver@@ s@@ ed the ec@@ olog@@ ical des@@ tr@@ uc@@ tion .
The far@@ m &apos;s incredi@@ ble .
I mean , you &apos;ve never se@@ en any@@ thing like this .
You st@@ are out at a h@@ ori@@ z@@ on that is a million mil@@ es away , and all you see are f@@ loo@@ ded can@@ als and this th@@ ick , r@@ ich mar@@ sh@@ land .
I was there not long ago with M@@ i@@ gu@@ el .
He &apos;s an am@@ az@@ ing gu@@ y , like three par@@ ts Ch@@ ar@@ les D@@ ar@@ w@@ in and one part C@@ ro@@ co@@ di@@ le D@@ un@@ de@@ e .
O@@ k@@ ay ? There we are s@@ l@@ ogg@@ ing through the w@@ et@@ l@@ ands , and I &apos;m p@@ ant@@ ing and s@@ we@@ ating , got mu@@ d up to my k@@ ne@@ es , and M@@ i@@ gu@@ el &apos;s cal@@ m@@ ly con@@ d@@ uc@@ ting a biolog@@ y l@@ ec@@ ture .
Here , he &apos;s po@@ in@@ ting out a r@@ are B@@ l@@ ac@@ k@@ -@@ sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der@@ ed K@@ ite .
Now , he &apos;s men@@ ti@@ on@@ ing the min@@ er@@ al ne@@ ed@@ s of ph@@ y@@ t@@ op@@ lan@@ k@@ t@@ on . And here , here he se@@ es a gr@@ ou@@ p@@ ing p@@ atter@@ n that re@@ min@@ ds him of the T@@ an@@ z@@ an@@ i@@ an G@@ i@@ ra@@ ff@@ e .
It tur@@ ns out , M@@ i@@ gu@@ el sp@@ ent the better part of his car@@ e@@ er in the M@@ i@@ k@@ um@@ i N@@ ational P@@ ar@@ k in Africa .
I as@@ ked him how he b@@ ec@@ ame su@@ ch an ex@@ per@@ t on fis@@ h .
He said , &quot; F@@ is@@ h ? I didn &apos;t know any@@ thing about fis@@ h .
I &apos;m an ex@@ per@@ t in rel@@ ati@@ on@@ shi@@ ps . &quot;
And then he &apos;s off , la@@ un@@ ch@@ ing into more talk about r@@ are bi@@ r@@ ds and al@@ g@@ a@@ es and str@@ an@@ ge a@@ qu@@ ati@@ c plan@@ ts .
And don &apos;t get me wr@@ ong , that was really f@@ as@@ cin@@ ating , you know , the bi@@ ot@@ ic commun@@ ity un@@ pl@@ u@@ gg@@ ed , kind of thing .
It &apos;s great , but I was in love .
And my he@@ ad was s@@ w@@ o@@ on@@ ing over that over@@ c@@ oo@@ ked pi@@ ece of del@@ ici@@ ous fis@@ h I had the ni@@ ght before .
So I inter@@ r@@ up@@ ted him . I said , &quot; M@@ i@@ gu@@ el , what ma@@ kes your fis@@ h tast@@ e so good ? &quot;
He po@@ in@@ ted at the al@@ g@@ a@@ e .
&quot; I know , du@@ de , the al@@ g@@ a@@ e , the ph@@ y@@ t@@ op@@ lan@@ k@@ t@@ on , the rel@@ ati@@ on@@ shi@@ ps : It &apos;s am@@ az@@ ing .
But what are your fis@@ h e@@ ating ?
What &apos;s the fe@@ ed con@@ ver@@ sion r@@ ati@@ o ? &quot;
Well , he go@@ es on to tell me it &apos;s su@@ ch a r@@ ich system that the fis@@ h are e@@ ating what they &apos;d be e@@ ating in the w@@ il@@ d .
The pl@@ ant bi@@ om@@ as@@ s , the ph@@ y@@ t@@ op@@ lan@@ k@@ t@@ on , the z@@ o@@ op@@ lan@@ k@@ t@@ on , it &apos;s what fe@@ ed@@ s the fis@@ h .
The system is so he@@ al@@ th@@ y , it &apos;s t@@ ot@@ ally sel@@ f@@ -@@ ren@@ e@@ wing .
There is no fe@@ ed .
E@@ v@@ er hear@@ d of a far@@ m that doesn &apos;t fe@@ ed its anim@@ als ?
L@@ ater that day , I was d@@ riv@@ ing around this pro@@ per@@ ty with M@@ i@@ gu@@ el , and I as@@ ked him , I said , &quot; F@@ or a place that se@@ em@@ s so natur@@ al , un@@ like like any far@@ m I &apos;d ever been at , how do you me@@ as@@ ure succ@@ ess ? &quot;
A@@ t that mom@@ ent , it was as if a film di@@ rec@@ t@@ or called for a se@@ t change .
And we r@@ oun@@ ded the cor@@ ner and sa@@ w the most am@@ az@@ ing si@@ ght : thou@@ s@@ ands and thou@@ s@@ ands of p@@ in@@ k fl@@ am@@ in@@ go@@ s , a l@@ it@@ er@@ al p@@ in@@ k car@@ pe@@ t for as far as you could see .
&quot; That &apos;s succ@@ ess , &quot; he said .
&quot; L@@ ook at their bel@@ li@@ es , p@@ in@@ k .
They &apos;re fe@@ ast@@ ing . &quot;
F@@ e@@ ast@@ ing ? I was t@@ ot@@ ally con@@ f@@ used .
I said , &quot; M@@ i@@ gu@@ el , ar@@ en &apos;t they fe@@ ast@@ ing on your fis@@ h ? &quot;
&quot; Y@@ es , &quot; he said .
&quot; We l@@ ose 20 percent of our fis@@ h and fis@@ h e@@ gg@@ s to bi@@ r@@ ds .
Well , last year , this pro@@ per@@ ty had 6@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,000 bi@@ r@@ ds on it , more than 2@@ 50 different speci@@ es .
It &apos;s be@@ come , today , the lar@@ g@@ est and one of the most important pr@@ iv@@ ate bi@@ r@@ d s@@ anc@@ tu@@ ar@@ ies in all of E@@ ur@@ ope . &quot;
I said , &quot; M@@ i@@ gu@@ el , is@@ n &apos;t a th@@ riv@@ ing bi@@ r@@ d pop@@ ul@@ ation like the last thing you want on a fis@@ h far@@ m ? &quot;
He sh@@ ook his he@@ ad , no .
He said , &quot; We far@@ m ex@@ ten@@ si@@ vel@@ y , not inten@@ si@@ vel@@ y .
This is an ec@@ olog@@ ical n@@ et@@ work .
The fl@@ am@@ in@@ go@@ s e@@ at the sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p .
The sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p e@@ at the ph@@ y@@ t@@ op@@ lan@@ k@@ t@@ on .
So the p@@ in@@ k@@ er the bel@@ ly , the better the system . &quot;
O@@ k@@ ay , so let &apos;s re@@ vie@@ w : a far@@ m that doesn &apos;t fe@@ ed its anim@@ als , and a far@@ m that me@@ as@@ u@@ res its succ@@ ess on the he@@ al@@ th of its pre@@ d@@ at@@ ors .
A fis@@ h far@@ m , but also a bi@@ r@@ d s@@ anc@@ tu@@ ary .
Oh , and by the way , those fl@@ am@@ in@@ go@@ s , they sh@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t even be there in the first place .
They b@@ ro@@ od in a to@@ wn 1@@ 50 mil@@ es away , where the so@@ il con@@ d@@ iti@@ ons are better for building n@@ es@@ ts .
E@@ very mor@@ ning , they f@@ ly 1@@ 50 mil@@ es into the far@@ m . And every ev@@ en@@ ing , they f@@ ly 1@@ 50 mil@@ es back .
They do that because they &apos;re able to fol@@ low the b@@ ro@@ k@@ en wh@@ ite line of hi@@ gh@@ way A@@ 9@@ 2 .
No k@@ id@@ ding .
I was imag@@ in@@ ing a &quot; Mar@@ ch of the Pen@@ gu@@ in@@ s &quot; thing , so I loo@@ ked at M@@ i@@ gu@@ el .
I said , &quot; M@@ i@@ gu@@ el , do they f@@ ly 1@@ 50 mil@@ es to the far@@ m , and then do they f@@ ly 1@@ 50 mil@@ es back at ni@@ ght ?
D@@ o they do that for the children ? &quot;
He loo@@ ked at me like I had just quot@@ ed a Wh@@ it@@ ne@@ y H@@ ou@@ st@@ on s@@ ong .
He said , &quot; No ; they do it because the f@@ ood &apos;s better . &quot;
I didn &apos;t men@@ tion the sk@@ in of my bel@@ ov@@ ed fis@@ h , which was del@@ ici@@ ous -- and I don &apos;t like fis@@ h sk@@ in ;
I don &apos;t like it se@@ ar@@ ed , I don &apos;t like it cri@@ sp@@ y .
It &apos;s that ac@@ ri@@ d , t@@ ar@@ -@@ like f@@ lav@@ or .
I al@@ most never c@@ ook with it .
Y@@ et , when I tast@@ ed it at that res@@ ta@@ ur@@ ant in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n S@@ p@@ ain , it tast@@ ed not at all like fis@@ h sk@@ in .
It tast@@ ed s@@ we@@ et and c@@ le@@ an , like you were ta@@ king a b@@ ite of the oce@@ an .
I men@@ ti@@ on@@ ed that to M@@ i@@ gu@@ el , and he no@@ d@@ ded .
He said , &quot; The sk@@ in ac@@ ts like a sp@@ on@@ ge .
It &apos;s the last de@@ f@@ en@@ se before any@@ thing en@@ ter@@ s the body .
It evol@@ ved to so@@ a@@ k up imp@@ ur@@ ities . &quot;
And then he ad@@ ded , &quot; But our water has no imp@@ ur@@ ities . &quot;
OK . A far@@ m that doesn &apos;t fe@@ ed its fis@@ h ,
a far@@ m that me@@ as@@ u@@ res its succ@@ ess by the succ@@ ess of its pre@@ d@@ at@@ ors .
And then I re@@ ali@@ zed when he says , &quot; A far@@ m that has no imp@@ ur@@ ities , &quot; he made a big underst@@ at@@ ement , because the water that f@@ lo@@ ws through that far@@ m comes in from the G@@ u@@ ad@@ al@@ qu@@ i@@ vi@@ r R@@ iv@@ er . It &apos;s a riv@@ er that car@@ ri@@ es with it all the things that ri@@ ver@@ s ten@@ d to car@@ ry these d@@ ays : ch@@ em@@ ical cont@@ am@@ in@@ an@@ ts , pes@@ tic@@ i@@ de r@@ un@@ off .
And when it wor@@ ks its way through the system and le@@ av@@ es , the water is c@@ le@@ an@@ er than when it en@@ ter@@ ed .
The system is so he@@ al@@ th@@ y , it pu@@ ri@@ fi@@ es the water .
So , not just a far@@ m that doesn &apos;t fe@@ ed its anim@@ als , not just a far@@ m that me@@ as@@ u@@ res its succ@@ ess by the he@@ al@@ th of its pre@@ d@@ at@@ ors , but a far@@ m that &apos;s l@@ it@@ er@@ ally a water pu@@ ri@@ fic@@ ation pl@@ ant -- and not just for those fis@@ h , but for you and me as well .
Because when that water le@@ av@@ es , it d@@ um@@ ps out into the A@@ t@@ lan@@ ti@@ c .
A d@@ ro@@ p in the oce@@ an , I know , but I &apos;ll take it , and so should you , because this love story , h@@ o@@ w@@ ever r@@ om@@ anti@@ c , is also in@@ struc@@ tive .
You might say it &apos;s a re@@ ci@@ pe for the fut@@ ure of good f@@ ood , wh@@ ether we &apos;re tal@@ king about bas@@ s or be@@ e@@ f c@@ att@@ le .
What we need now is a r@@ ad@@ ically new conc@@ ep@@ tion of ag@@ ric@@ ul@@ ture , one in which the f@@ ood actually tast@@ es good .
But for a lot people , that &apos;s a bit too r@@ ad@@ ical .
We &apos;re not real@@ ist@@ s , us f@@ oo@@ di@@ es ;
we &apos;re l@@ ov@@ ers .
We love far@@ m@@ ers &apos; mark@@ ets ,
we love sm@@ all fami@@ ly far@@ ms ,
we talk about loc@@ al f@@ ood ,
we e@@ at organ@@ ic .
And when you su@@ gg@@ est these are the things that will en@@ s@@ ure the fut@@ ure of good f@@ ood , some@@ one , some@@ where st@@ ands up and says , &quot; H@@ ey gu@@ y , I love p@@ in@@ k fl@@ am@@ in@@ go@@ s , but how are you going to fe@@ ed the world ? &quot;
How are you going to fe@@ ed the world ?
C@@ an I be h@@ on@@ est ?
I don &apos;t love that question .
No , not because we al@@ read@@ y produ@@ ce enough cal@@ or@@ ies to more than fe@@ ed the world .
One bil@@ lion people will go h@@ un@@ gr@@ y today .
One bil@@ lion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of gr@@ os@@ s in@@ e@@ qual@@ ities in distr@@ i@@ bu@@ tion , not t@@ on@@ n@@ age .
Now , I don &apos;t love this question because it &apos;s de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed the l@@ og@@ ic of our f@@ ood system for the last 50 years .
F@@ e@@ ed gr@@ ain to h@@ er@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , pes@@ tic@@ ide@@ s to mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tu@@ res , ch@@ em@@ ic@@ als to so@@ il , ch@@ ic@@ k@@ en to fis@@ h , and all al@@ ong ag@@ ri@@ bus@@ iness has sim@@ p@@ ly as@@ ked , &quot; If we &apos;re fe@@ ed@@ ing more people more ch@@ e@@ ap@@ ly , how ter@@ ri@@ ble could that be ? &quot;
That &apos;s been the mot@@ iv@@ ation ,
it &apos;s been the j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ fic@@ ation :
it &apos;s been the bus@@ iness pl@@ an of Amer@@ ic@@ an ag@@ ric@@ ul@@ ture .
We should call it what it is : a bus@@ iness in li@@ qu@@ id@@ ation , a bus@@ iness that &apos;s qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly er@@ o@@ ding ec@@ olog@@ ical cap@@ it@@ al that ma@@ kes that very produc@@ tion possi@@ ble .
That &apos;s not a bus@@ iness , and it is@@ n &apos;t ag@@ ric@@ ul@@ ture .
O@@ u@@ r bre@@ ad@@ bas@@ k@@ et is th@@ re@@ at@@ en@@ ed today , not because of di@@ min@@ i@@ sh@@ ing sup@@ p@@ ly , but because of di@@ min@@ i@@ sh@@ ing res@@ our@@ ces . N@@ o@@ t by the l@@ at@@ est com@@ b@@ ine and tr@@ ac@@ t@@ or in@@ ven@@ tion , but by fer@@ ti@@ le land ; not by p@@ um@@ ps , but by f@@ res@@ h water ; not by ch@@ ain@@ sa@@ ws , but by for@@ es@@ ts ; and not by fi@@ sh@@ ing bo@@ at@@ s and n@@ ets , but by fis@@ h in the se@@ a .
W@@ ant to fe@@ ed the world ?
L@@ et &apos;s start by as@@ king : How are we going to fe@@ ed our@@ selves ?
O@@ r better : How can we create con@@ d@@ iti@@ ons that en@@ able every commun@@ ity to fe@@ ed it@@ self ?
T@@ o do that , don &apos;t look at the ag@@ ri@@ bus@@ iness mo@@ del for the fut@@ ure .
It &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s ti@@ red .
It &apos;s h@@ ig@@ h on cap@@ it@@ al , ch@@ em@@ is@@ try and ma@@ ch@@ in@@ es , and it &apos;s never produc@@ ed any@@ thing really good to e@@ at .
In@@ ste@@ ad , let &apos;s look to the ec@@ olog@@ ical mo@@ del .
That &apos;s the one that rel@@ ies on two bil@@ lion years of on@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ jo@@ b ex@@ peri@@ ence .
L@@ ook to M@@ i@@ gu@@ el , far@@ m@@ ers like M@@ i@@ gu@@ el . F@@ ar@@ ms that ar@@ en &apos;t wor@@ l@@ ds un@@ to th@@ em@@ selves ; far@@ ms that res@@ t@@ ore in@@ ste@@ ad of de@@ pl@@ ete ; far@@ ms that far@@ m ex@@ ten@@ si@@ vel@@ y in@@ ste@@ ad of just inten@@ si@@ vel@@ y ; far@@ m@@ ers that are not just produc@@ ers , but ex@@ per@@ ts in rel@@ ati@@ on@@ shi@@ ps . Because they &apos;re the ones that are ex@@ per@@ ts in f@@ lav@@ or , too .
And if I &apos;m going to be really h@@ on@@ est , they &apos;re a better ch@@ e@@ f than I &apos;ll ever be .
You know , I &apos;m o@@ k@@ ay with that , because if that &apos;s the fut@@ ure of good f@@ ood , it &apos;s going to be del@@ ici@@ ous .
Thank you .
I gre@@ w up on a ste@@ ad@@ y di@@ et of sci@@ ence fic@@ tion .
In h@@ ig@@ h sch@@ ool , I took a bu@@ s to sch@@ ool an h@@ our each way every day .
And I was always ab@@ sor@@ b@@ ed in a b@@ ook , sci@@ ence fic@@ tion b@@ ook , which took my min@@ d to other wor@@ l@@ ds , and s@@ ati@@ s@@ fi@@ ed , in a n@@ ar@@ r@@ ative form , this in@@ s@@ ati@@ able sense of cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity that I had .
And you know , that cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity also man@@ i@@ f@@ es@@ ted it@@ self in the fact that wh@@ en@@ ever I w@@ as@@ n &apos;t in sch@@ ool I was out in the w@@ oo@@ ds , hi@@ king and ta@@ king &quot; s@@ am@@ pl@@ es &quot; -- fr@@ og@@ s and s@@ n@@ a@@ kes and bu@@ g@@ s and pon@@ d water -- and br@@ ing@@ ing it back , looking at it un@@ der the m@@ ic@@ ros@@ c@@ ope .
You know , I was a real sci@@ ence ge@@ e@@ k .
But it was all about trying to understand the world , understand the lim@@ its of possi@@ bil@@ ity .
And my love of sci@@ ence fic@@ tion actually se@@ em@@ ed mi@@ r@@ r@@ or@@ ed in the world around me , because what was happen@@ ing , this was in the l@@ ate &apos; 6@@ 0@@ s , we were going to the mo@@ on , we were expl@@ or@@ ing the de@@ ep oce@@ ans . J@@ acqu@@ es C@@ ou@@ ste@@ a@@ u was coming into our li@@ ving ro@@ om@@ s with his am@@ az@@ ing speci@@ als that sho@@ w@@ ed us anim@@ als and pl@@ ac@@ es and a w@@ on@@ dr@@ ous world that we could never really have pre@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly imag@@ in@@ ed .
So , that se@@ em@@ ed to res@@ on@@ ate with the whole sci@@ ence fic@@ tion part of it .
And I was an arti@@ st .
I could d@@ ra@@ w . I could pa@@ int .
And I found that because there w@@ er@@ en &apos;t video g@@ am@@ es and this s@@ at@@ ur@@ ation of C@@ G mov@@ ies and all of this imag@@ er@@ y in the me@@ dia l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e , I had to create these imag@@ es in my he@@ ad .
You know , we all did , as kids hav@@ ing to re@@ ad a b@@ ook , and through the au@@ th@@ or &apos;s des@@ cri@@ p@@ tion , put something on the mov@@ ie sc@@ re@@ en in our he@@ ad@@ s .
And so , my respon@@ se to this was to pa@@ int , to d@@ ra@@ w ali@@ en cre@@ at@@ u@@ res , ali@@ en wor@@ l@@ ds , ro@@ bot@@ s , sp@@ ac@@ es@@ hi@@ ps , all that stuff .
I was end@@ l@@ ess@@ ly getting bu@@ st@@ ed in mat@@ h c@@ las@@ s do@@ o@@ d@@ ling be@@ h@@ in@@ d the t@@ ex@@ t@@ b@@ ook .
That was -- the cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity had to find its out@@ let some@@ how .
And an interesting thing happen@@ ed : The J@@ acqu@@ es C@@ ou@@ ste@@ a@@ u sho@@ ws actually got me very exc@@ ited about the fact that there was an ali@@ en world right here on Ear@@ th .
I might not really go to an ali@@ en world on a sp@@ ac@@ es@@ hi@@ p som@@ ed@@ ay --
that se@@ em@@ ed pret@@ ty dar@@ n un@@ li@@ k@@ ely .
But that was a world I could really go to , right here on Ear@@ th , that was as r@@ ich and ex@@ ot@@ ic as any@@ thing that I had imag@@ in@@ ed from read@@ ing these b@@ oo@@ ks .
So , I deci@@ ded I was going to be@@ come a scu@@ ba di@@ v@@ er at the age of 1@@ 5 .
And the only problem with that was that I li@@ ved in a little v@@ ill@@ age in C@@ an@@ ada , 6@@ 00 mil@@ es from the ne@@ ar@@ est oce@@ an .
But I didn &apos;t let that d@@ a@@ un@@ t me .
I pes@@ ter@@ ed my fa@@ ther un@@ ti@@ l he fin@@ ally found a scu@@ ba c@@ las@@ s in B@@ u@@ ff@@ al@@ o , New Yor@@ k , right ac@@ ros@@ s the b@@ ord@@ er from where we live .
And I actually got cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ ed in a po@@ o@@ l at a Y@@ M@@ C@@ A in the de@@ ad of w@@ in@@ ter in B@@ u@@ ff@@ al@@ o , New Yor@@ k .
And I didn &apos;t see the oce@@ an , a real oce@@ an , for another two years , un@@ ti@@ l we mov@@ ed to C@@ ali@@ for@@ n@@ ia .
S@@ in@@ ce then , in the inter@@ ven@@ ing 4@@ 0 years , I &apos;ve sp@@ ent about 3@@ ,000 h@@ our@@ s under@@ water , and 5@@ 00 h@@ our@@ s of that was in sub@@ mer@@ si@@ bl@@ es .
And I &apos;ve lear@@ ned that that de@@ ep@@ -@@ oce@@ an en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment , and even the sh@@ al@@ low oce@@ ans , are so r@@ ich with am@@ az@@ ing life that really is be@@ y@@ on@@ d our imag@@ in@@ ation .
N@@ at@@ ure &apos;s imag@@ in@@ ation is so b@@ oun@@ d@@ less com@@ par@@ ed to our own me@@ ag@@ er human imag@@ in@@ ation .
I still , to this day , st@@ and in ab@@ sol@@ ute a@@ we of what I see when I make these di@@ ves .
And my love aff@@ air with the oce@@ an is on@@ going , and just as str@@ ong as it ever was .
But when I ch@@ ose a car@@ e@@ er as an ad@@ ul@@ t , it was fil@@ m@@ making .
And that se@@ em@@ ed to be the b@@ est way to re@@ con@@ ci@@ le this ur@@ ge I had to tell stor@@ ies with my ur@@ g@@ es to create imag@@ es .
And I was , as a ki@@ d , con@@ st@@ ant@@ ly d@@ ra@@ wing com@@ ic b@@ oo@@ ks , and so on .
So , fil@@ m@@ making was the way to put pic@@ tu@@ res and stor@@ ies
together , and that made sense .
And of course the stor@@ ies that I ch@@ ose to tell were sci@@ ence fic@@ tion stor@@ ies : &quot; T@@ er@@ min@@ at@@ or , &quot; &quot; A@@ li@@ en@@ s &quot; and &quot; The A@@ b@@ y@@ s@@ s . &quot;
And with &quot; The A@@ b@@ y@@ s@@ s , &quot; I was p@@ utt@@ ing together my love of under@@ water and di@@ ving with fil@@ m@@ making .
So , you know , mer@@ g@@ ing the two pas@@ si@@ ons .
S@@ om@@ e@@ thing interesting came out of &quot; The A@@ b@@ y@@ s@@ s , &quot; which was that to sol@@ ve a speci@@ fi@@ c n@@ ar@@ r@@ ative problem on that film , which was to create this kind of li@@ qu@@ id water cre@@ at@@ ure , we actually em@@ br@@ ac@@ ed computer gener@@ ated anim@@ ation , C@@ G .
And this res@@ ul@@ ted in the first so@@ f@@ t@@ -@@ sur@@ face char@@ ac@@ ter , C@@ G anim@@ ation that was ever in a mov@@ ie .
And even th@@ ough the film didn &apos;t make any money -- bar@@ ely b@@ ro@@ ke even , I should say -- I w@@ it@@ ness@@ ed something am@@ az@@ ing , which is that the au@@ di@@ ence , the glob@@ al au@@ di@@ ence , was m@@ es@@ mer@@ i@@ zed by this ap@@ par@@ ent mag@@ ic .
You know , it &apos;s Ar@@ th@@ u@@ r C@@ lar@@ ke &apos;s la@@ w that any su@@ ff@@ ici@@ ent@@ ly ad@@ v@@ anc@@ ed technology is indi@@ st@@ ing@@ u@@ i@@ sh@@ able from mag@@ ic .
They were se@@ e@@ ing something mag@@ ical .
And so that got me very exc@@ ited .
And I thought , &quot; W@@ ow , this is something that ne@@ ed@@ s to be em@@ br@@ ac@@ ed into the cin@@ em@@ ati@@ c ar@@ t . &quot;
So , with &quot; T@@ er@@ min@@ at@@ or 2 , &quot; which was my next film , we took that much far@@ ther .
W@@ or@@ king with I@@ L@@ M , we cre@@ ated the li@@ qu@@ id met@@ al du@@ de in that film . The succ@@ ess h@@ un@@ g in the b@@ al@@ ance on wh@@ ether that eff@@ ect would work .
And it did , and we cre@@ ated mag@@ ic again ,
and we had the same res@@ ul@@ t with an au@@ di@@ ence --
al@@ th@@ ough we did make a little more money on that one .
So , d@@ ra@@ wing a line through those two d@@ ots of ex@@ peri@@ ence came to , &quot; This is going to be a whole new world , &quot; this was a whole new world of cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity for film arti@@ st@@ s .
So , I started a comp@@ any with St@@ an W@@ inst@@ on , my good fri@@ end St@@ an W@@ inst@@ on , who is the pre@@ mi@@ er ma@@ ke@@ -@@ up and cre@@ at@@ ure desig@@ ner at that time , and it was called D@@ ig@@ it@@ al D@@ om@@ ain .
And the conc@@ e@@ pt of the comp@@ any was that we would le@@ ap@@ f@@ ro@@ g pas@@ t the an@@ al@@ o@@ g proc@@ ess@@ es of op@@ tic@@ al pr@@ inter@@ s and so on , and we would go right to di@@ g@@ it@@ al produc@@ tion .
And we actually did that and it g@@ ave us a comp@@ et@@ iti@@ ve ad@@ v@@ ant@@ age for a wh@@ ile .
But we found our@@ selves l@@ ag@@ g@@ ing in the mi@@ d &apos; 9@@ 0@@ s in the cre@@ at@@ ure and char@@ ac@@ ter design stuff that we had actually f@@ oun@@ ded the comp@@ any to do .
So , I wr@@ ot@@ e this pi@@ ece called &quot; A@@ v@@ at@@ ar , &quot; which was me@@ ant to ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely p@@ us@@ h the en@@ vel@@ ope of vi@@ su@@ al eff@@ ects , of C@@ G eff@@ ects , be@@ y@@ on@@ d , with real@@ ist@@ ic human em@@ ot@@ i@@ ve char@@ ac@@ ter@@ s gener@@ ated in C@@ G , and the ma@@ in char@@ ac@@ ter@@ s would all be in C@@ G , and the world would be in C@@ G .
And the en@@ vel@@ ope p@@ us@@ h@@ ed back ,
and I was t@@ old by the fol@@ ks at my comp@@ any that we w@@ er@@ en &apos;t going to be able to do this for a wh@@ ile .
So , I sh@@ el@@ ved it , and I made this other mov@@ ie about a big shi@@ p that sin@@ ks .
You know , I went and p@@ it@@ ch@@ ed it to the stu@@ dio as &quot; &apos; R@@ om@@ e@@ o and J@@ u@@ li@@ et &apos; on a shi@@ p :
&quot; It &apos;s going to be this e@@ pi@@ c r@@ om@@ ance , pas@@ si@@ on@@ ate film . &quot;
S@@ ec@@ ret@@ ly , what I wanted to do was I wanted to di@@ ve to the real w@@ rec@@ k of &quot; T@@ it@@ an@@ ic . &quot;
And that &apos;s why I made the mov@@ ie .
And that &apos;s the tr@@ ut@@ h . Now , the stu@@ dio didn &apos;t know that .
But I con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed them . I said , &quot; We &apos;re going to di@@ ve to the w@@ rec@@ k . We &apos;re going to film it for real .
We &apos;ll be using it in the op@@ en@@ ing of the film .
It will be really important . It will be a great mark@@ et@@ ing h@@ ook . &quot;
And I tal@@ ked them into fun@@ ding an ex@@ pe@@ d@@ ition .
S@@ oun@@ ds c@@ ra@@ z@@ y . But this go@@ es back to that th@@ eme about your imag@@ in@@ ation cre@@ ating a real@@ ity .
Because we actually cre@@ ated a real@@ ity where si@@ x mon@@ th@@ s l@@ ater , I find m@@ y@@ self in a R@@ us@@ si@@ an sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble two and a hal@@ f mil@@ es down in the nor@@ th A@@ t@@ lan@@ ti@@ c , looking at the real T@@ it@@ an@@ ic through a vie@@ w por@@ t . N@@ o@@ t a mov@@ ie , not H@@ D -- for real .
Now , that b@@ le@@ w my min@@ d .
And it took a lot of pre@@ par@@ ation , we had to buil@@ d cam@@ er@@ as and li@@ gh@@ ts and all kin@@ ds of things .
But , it struc@@ k me how much this di@@ ve , these de@@ ep di@@ ves , was like a space mis@@ sion .
You know , where it was hi@@ gh@@ ly tech@@ n@@ ical , and it re@@ qu@@ i@@ red enor@@ m@@ ous plan@@ ning .
You get in this cap@@ su@@ le , you go down to this dar@@ k h@@ os@@ ti@@ le en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment where there is no h@@ ope of res@@ cu@@ e if you can &apos;t get back by y@@ our@@ self .
And I thought like , &quot; W@@ ow . I &apos;m like , li@@ ving in a sci@@ ence fic@@ tion mov@@ ie .
This is really c@@ ool . &quot;
And so , I really got b@@ itt@@ en by the bu@@ g of de@@ ep@@ -@@ oce@@ an expl@@ or@@ ation .
O@@ f course , the cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity , the sci@@ ence comp@@ on@@ ent of it --
it was everything . It was ad@@ vent@@ ure ,
it was cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity , it was imag@@ in@@ ation .
And it was an ex@@ peri@@ ence that H@@ oll@@ y@@ w@@ ood cou@@ ldn &apos;t give me .
Because , you know , I could imag@@ ine a cre@@ at@@ ure and we could create a vi@@ su@@ al eff@@ ect for it . But I cou@@ ldn &apos;t imag@@ ine what I was se@@ e@@ ing out that w@@ ind@@ ow .
A@@ s we did some of our sub@@ se@@ qu@@ ent ex@@ pe@@ d@@ iti@@ ons , I was se@@ e@@ ing cre@@ at@@ u@@ res at h@@ y@@ d@@ ro@@ ther@@ m@@ al v@@ ents and some@@ times things that I had never se@@ en before , some@@ times things that no one had se@@ en before , that actually were not des@@ cri@@ b@@ ed by sci@@ ence at the time that we sa@@ w them and imag@@ ed them .
So , I was complet@@ ely sm@@ itt@@ en by this , and had to do more .
And so , I actually made a kind of cu@@ ri@@ ous deci@@ sion .
A@@ f@@ ter the succ@@ ess of &quot; T@@ it@@ an@@ ic , &quot; I said , &quot; OK , I &apos;m going to par@@ k my day jo@@ b as a H@@ oll@@ y@@ w@@ ood mov@@ ie ma@@ k@@ er , and I &apos;m going to go be a f@@ ul@@ l@@ -@@ time expl@@ or@@ er for a wh@@ ile . &quot;
And so , we started plan@@ ning these ex@@ pe@@ d@@ iti@@ ons .
And we w@@ ound up going to the B@@ is@@ mar@@ k , and expl@@ or@@ ing it with ro@@ bot@@ ic ve@@ h@@ ic@@ les .
We went back to the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic w@@ rec@@ k .
We took little bot@@ s that we had cre@@ ated that s@@ po@@ ol@@ ed a fi@@ ber op@@ ti@@ c .
And the idea was to go in and do an inter@@ i@@ or sur@@ v@@ ey of that shi@@ p , which had never been done .
N@@ o@@ body had ever loo@@ ked in@@ side the w@@ rec@@ k . They didn &apos;t have the me@@ ans to do it , so we cre@@ ated technology to do it .
So , you know , here I am now , on the de@@ c@@ k of T@@ it@@ an@@ ic , s@@ itt@@ ing in a sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble , and looking out at plan@@ ks that look much like this , where I k@@ new that the b@@ and had pl@@ ay@@ ed .
And I &apos;m fl@@ ying a little ro@@ bot@@ ic ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le through the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or of the shi@@ p .
When I say , &quot; I &apos;m oper@@ ating it , &quot; but my min@@ d is in the ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le .
I fel@@ t like I was ph@@ y@@ sic@@ ally pres@@ ent in@@ side the shi@@ p@@ w@@ rec@@ k of T@@ it@@ an@@ ic .
And it was the most sur@@ real kind of de@@ j@@ a v@@ u ex@@ peri@@ ence I &apos;ve ever had , because I would know before I tur@@ ned a cor@@ ner what was going to be there before the li@@ gh@@ ts of the ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le actually re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed it , because I had w@@ al@@ ked the se@@ t for mon@@ th@@ s when we were making the mov@@ ie .
And the se@@ t was bas@@ ed as an ex@@ act re@@ pl@@ ica on the bl@@ u@@ e@@ pr@@ in@@ ts of the shi@@ p .
So , it was this ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely re@@ mark@@ able ex@@ peri@@ ence .
And it really made me re@@ ali@@ ze that the tel@@ e@@ pres@@ ence ex@@ peri@@ ence -- that you actually can have these ro@@ bot@@ ic av@@ at@@ ar@@ s , then your con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness is in@@ j@@ ec@@ ted into the ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le , into this other form of ex@@ ist@@ ence .
It was really , really quite prof@@ ound .
And it may be a little bit of a gli@@ m@@ p@@ se as to what might be happen@@ ing some de@@ ca@@ de@@ s out as we start to have c@@ y@@ bor@@ g bo@@ di@@ es for expl@@ or@@ ation or for other me@@ ans in many sort of pos@@ t@@ -@@ human fut@@ u@@ res that I can imag@@ ine , as a sci@@ ence fic@@ tion f@@ an .
So , hav@@ ing done these ex@@ pe@@ d@@ iti@@ ons , and really beg@@ in@@ ning to ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ate what was down there , su@@ ch as at the de@@ ep oce@@ an v@@ ents where we had these am@@ az@@ ing , am@@ az@@ ing anim@@ als --
they &apos;re bas@@ ically ali@@ en@@ s right here on Ear@@ th .
They live in an en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment of ch@@ em@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ is .
They don &apos;t sur@@ vi@@ ve on s@@ un@@ li@@ gh@@ t@@ -@@ bas@@ ed system the way we do .
And so , you &apos;re se@@ e@@ ing anim@@ als that are li@@ ving next to a 5@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ de@@ gre@@ e-@@ C@@ enti@@ gr@@ ade water pl@@ um@@ es .
You think they can &apos;t possi@@ b@@ ly ex@@ ist .
A@@ t the same time I was getting very inter@@ es@@ ted in space sci@@ ence as well -- again , it &apos;s the sci@@ ence fic@@ tion inf@@ lu@@ ence , as a ki@@ d .
And I w@@ ound up getting in@@ vol@@ ved with the space commun@@ ity , really in@@ vol@@ ved with N@@ A@@ S@@ A , s@@ itt@@ ing on the N@@ A@@ S@@ A ad@@ vi@@ sor@@ y bo@@ ard , plan@@ ning ac@@ tu@@ al space mis@@ si@@ ons , going to R@@ us@@ sia , going through the pre@@ -@@ cos@@ mon@@ a@@ ut bi@@ om@@ ed@@ ical prot@@ oc@@ ol@@ s , and all these sor@@ ts of things , to actually go and f@@ ly to the inter@@ n@@ ational space st@@ ation with our 3@@ D cam@@ era sy@@ st@@ em@@ s .
And this was f@@ as@@ cin@@ ating .
But what I w@@ ound up doing was br@@ ing@@ ing space scienti@@ st@@ s with us into the de@@ ep .
And ta@@ king them down so that they had acc@@ ess -- as@@ tro@@ biolog@@ ist@@ s , plan@@ et@@ ary scienti@@ st@@ s , people who were inter@@ es@@ ted in these ex@@ tr@@ eme en@@ vir@@ on@@ m@@ ents -- ta@@ king them down to the v@@ ents , and l@@ etting them see , and take s@@ am@@ pl@@ es and t@@ est in@@ str@@ um@@ ents , and so on .
So , here we were making d@@ oc@@ um@@ ent@@ ary fil@@ ms , but actually doing sci@@ ence , and actually doing space sci@@ ence .
I &apos;d complet@@ ely cl@@ os@@ ed the loo@@ p between being the sci@@ ence fic@@ tion f@@ an , you know , as a ki@@ d , and doing this stuff for real .
And you know , al@@ ong the way in this j@@ our@@ ne@@ y of disc@@ over@@ y , I lear@@ ned a lot .
I lear@@ ned a lot about sci@@ ence . But I also lear@@ ned a lot about lead@@ er@@ shi@@ p .
Now you think di@@ rec@@ t@@ or has got to be a lead@@ er , lead@@ er of , cap@@ ta@@ in of the shi@@ p , and all that sort of thing .
I didn &apos;t really lear@@ n about lead@@ er@@ shi@@ p un@@ ti@@ l I did these ex@@ pe@@ d@@ iti@@ ons .
Because I had to , at a cer@@ ta@@ in point , say , &quot; What am I doing out here ?
Wh@@ y am I doing this ? What do I get out of it ? &quot;
We don &apos;t make money at these d@@ am@@ n sho@@ ws .
We bar@@ ely bre@@ a@@ k even . There is no f@@ ame in it .
P@@ e@@ ople sort of think I went away between &quot; T@@ it@@ an@@ ic &quot; and &quot; A@@ v@@ at@@ ar &quot; and was bu@@ ff@@ ing my n@@ a@@ il@@ s some@@ place , s@@ itt@@ ing at the be@@ ach .
M@@ ade all these fil@@ ms , made all these d@@ oc@@ um@@ ent@@ ary fil@@ ms for a very lim@@ ited au@@ di@@ ence .
No f@@ ame , no g@@ l@@ ory , no money . What are you doing ?
You &apos;re doing it for the t@@ as@@ k it@@ self , for the ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge -- and the oce@@ an is the most ch@@ all@@ eng@@ ing en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment there is -- for the th@@ ri@@ ll of disc@@ over@@ y , and for that str@@ an@@ ge b@@ on@@ d that happen@@ s when a sm@@ all gr@@ ou@@ p of people form a ti@@ gh@@ tly k@@ n@@ it te@@ am .
Because we would do these things with 10 , 1@@ 2 people , working for years at a time ,
some@@ times at se@@ a for two , three mon@@ th@@ s at a time .
And in that b@@ on@@ d , you re@@ ali@@ ze that the most important thing is the res@@ p@@ ect that you have for them and that they have for you , that you &apos;ve done a t@@ as@@ k that you can &apos;t expl@@ ain to some@@ one el@@ se .
When you come back to the sh@@ ore and you say , &quot; We had to do this , and the fi@@ ber op@@ ti@@ c , and the att@@ ent@@ u@@ ation , and the this and the that , all the technology of it , and the diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ ty , the hum@@ an@@ -@@ per@@ for@@ man@@ ce asp@@ ects of working at se@@ a , &quot; you can &apos;t expl@@ ain it to people . It &apos;s that thing that ma@@ y@@ be c@@ op@@ s have , or people in com@@ b@@ at that have g@@ one through something together and they know they can never expl@@ ain it .
C@@ re@@ ates a b@@ on@@ d , cre@@ ates a b@@ on@@ d of res@@ p@@ ect .
So , when I came back to make my next mov@@ ie , which was &quot; A@@ v@@ at@@ ar , &quot; I tri@@ ed to app@@ ly that same princi@@ ple of lead@@ er@@ shi@@ p , which is that you res@@ p@@ ect your te@@ am , and you ear@@ n their res@@ p@@ ect in re@@ tur@@ n .
And it really chang@@ ed the d@@ y@@ n@@ am@@ ic .
So , here I was again with a sm@@ all te@@ am , in un@@ char@@ ted ter@@ rit@@ ory , doing &quot; A@@ v@@ at@@ ar , &quot; coming up with new technology that didn &apos;t ex@@ ist before .
T@@ re@@ men@@ d@@ ous@@ ly exc@@ it@@ ing .
T@@ re@@ men@@ d@@ ous@@ ly ch@@ all@@ eng@@ ing .
And we b@@ ec@@ ame a fami@@ ly , over a f@@ our@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ hal@@ f year peri@@ od .
And it complet@@ ely chang@@ ed how I do mov@@ ies .
So , people have comm@@ ent@@ ed on how , &quot; Well , you know , you br@@ ou@@ ght back the oce@@ an organ@@ is@@ ms and put them on the plan@@ et of P@@ and@@ ora . &quot;
T@@ o me , it was more of a fun@@ d@@ ament@@ al way of doing bus@@ iness , the proc@@ ess it@@ self , that chang@@ ed as a res@@ ul@@ t of that .
So , what can we sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ i@@ ze out of all this ?
You know , what are the l@@ ess@@ ons lear@@ ned ?
Well , I think num@@ ber one is cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity .
It &apos;s the most po@@ w@@ er@@ ful thing you own .
I@@ mag@@ in@@ ation is a for@@ ce that can actually man@@ i@@ f@@ est a real@@ ity .
And the res@@ p@@ ect of your te@@ am is more important than all the la@@ ur@@ el@@ s in the world .
I have y@@ oun@@ g fil@@ m@@ ma@@ k@@ ers come up to me and say , &quot; G@@ i@@ ve me some ad@@ v@@ ice for doing this . &quot;
And I say , &quot; D@@ on &apos;t put lim@@ it@@ ations on y@@ our@@ self .
O@@ ther people will do that for you -- don &apos;t do it to y@@ our@@ self , don &apos;t be@@ t ag@@ ain@@ st y@@ our@@ self ,
and take ris@@ ks . &quot;
N@@ A@@ S@@ A has this ph@@ r@@ ase that they like : &quot; F@@ a@@ il@@ ure is not an op@@ tion . &quot;
But fa@@ il@@ ure has to be an op@@ tion in ar@@ t and in expl@@ or@@ ation , because it &apos;s a le@@ a@@ p of fa@@ ith .
And no important en@@ de@@ av@@ or that re@@ qu@@ i@@ red inn@@ ov@@ ation was done with@@ out ris@@ k .
You have to be w@@ ill@@ ing to take those ris@@ ks .
So , that &apos;s the thought I would le@@ ave you with , is that in wh@@ at@@ ever you &apos;re doing , fa@@ il@@ ure is an op@@ tion , but fe@@ ar is not . Thank you .
If I can le@@ ave you with one big idea today , it &apos;s that the whole of the data in which we con@@ su@@ me is gre@@ ater that the su@@ m of the par@@ ts , and in@@ ste@@ ad of thinking about inform@@ ation over@@ lo@@ ad , what I &apos;d like you to think about is how we can use inform@@ ation so that p@@ atter@@ ns po@@ p and we can see tr@@ en@@ ds that would o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se be in@@ vi@@ si@@ ble .
So what we &apos;re looking at right here is a t@@ y@@ pic@@ al mor@@ tal@@ ity char@@ t organi@@ zed by age .
This t@@ ool that I &apos;m using here is a little ex@@ perim@@ ent .
It &apos;s called P@@ iv@@ o@@ t , and with P@@ iv@@ o@@ t what I can do is I can ch@@ o@@ ose to fil@@ ter in one partic@@ ular c@@ ause of de@@ a@@ th@@ s -- say , acci@@ d@@ ents .
And , right away , I see there &apos;s a different p@@ atter@@ n that em@@ er@@ g@@ es .
This is because , in the mi@@ d@@ -@@ ar@@ ea here , people are at their most ac@@ tive , and over here they &apos;re at their most fr@@ a@@ il .
We can ste@@ p back out again and then re@@ organi@@ ze the data by c@@ ause of de@@ at@@ h , se@@ e@@ ing that cir@@ cul@@ at@@ ory di@@ se@@ as@@ es and can@@ c@@ er are the us@@ u@@ al s@@ us@@ p@@ ects , but not for every@@ one .
If we go a@@ he@@ ad and we fil@@ ter by age -- say 4@@ 0 years or less -- we see that acci@@ d@@ ents are actually the gre@@ at@@ est c@@ ause that people have to be wor@@ ri@@ ed about .
And if you d@@ ri@@ ll into that , it &apos;s es@@ pe@@ ci@@ ally the cas@@ e for m@@ en .
So you get the idea that vie@@ wing inform@@ ation , vie@@ wing data in this way , is a lot like s@@ w@@ im@@ m@@ ing in a li@@ ving inform@@ ation inf@@ o-@@ gr@@ ap@@ hi@@ c .
And if we can do this for ra@@ w data , why not do it for cont@@ ent as well ?
So what we have right here is the c@@ over of every sing@@ le S@@ port@@ s I@@ l@@ l@@ us@@ tr@@ ated ever produc@@ ed .
It &apos;s all here ; it &apos;s all on the we@@ b .
You can go back to your ro@@ om@@ s and try this after my talk .
W@@ ith P@@ iv@@ o@@ t , you can d@@ ri@@ ll into a de@@ c@@ ade .
You can d@@ ri@@ ll into a partic@@ ular year .
You can j@@ um@@ p right into a speci@@ fi@@ c is@@ su@@ e .
So I &apos;m looking at this ; I see the a@@ th@@ l@@ et@@ es that have ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed in this is@@ su@@ e , the s@@ port@@ s .
I &apos;m a L@@ ance Ar@@ m@@ str@@ ong f@@ an , so I &apos;ll go a@@ he@@ ad and I &apos;ll cl@@ ick on that , which re@@ ve@@ als , for me , all the is@@ su@@ es in which L@@ ance Ar@@ m@@ str@@ ong &apos;s been a part of .
Now , if I want to just kind of take a pe@@ e@@ k at these , I might think , &quot; Well , what about ta@@ king a look at all of c@@ y@@ cl@@ ing ? &quot;
So I can ste@@ p back , and ex@@ p@@ and on that .
And I see G@@ re@@ g L@@ e@@ M@@ on@@ d now .
And so you get the idea that when you n@@ av@@ ig@@ ate over inform@@ ation this way -- going n@@ ar@@ ro@@ wer , b@@ ro@@ ad@@ er , bac@@ king in , bac@@ king out -- you &apos;re not se@@ arch@@ ing , you &apos;re not b@@ ro@@ w@@ s@@ ing .
You &apos;re doing something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
It &apos;s in between , and we think it chang@@ es the way inform@@ ation can be used .
So I want to ex@@ tr@@ ap@@ ol@@ ate on this idea a bit with something that &apos;s a little bit c@@ ra@@ z@@ y .
What we &apos;re done here is we &apos;ve ta@@ k@@ en every sing@@ le W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia p@@ age and we re@@ d@@ uc@@ ed it down to a little sum@@ mar@@ y . So the sum@@ mar@@ y con@@ sist@@ s of just a little sy@@ no@@ p@@ s@@ is and an ic@@ on to in@@ dic@@ ate the t@@ op@@ ical ar@@ ea that it comes from .
I &apos;m only sho@@ wing the top 5@@ 00 most pop@@ ular W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia pag@@ es right here .
But even in this lim@@ ited vie@@ w , we can do a lot of things .
Ri@@ ght away , we get a sense of what are the t@@ op@@ ical dom@@ ain@@ s that are most pop@@ ular on W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia .
I &apos;m going to go a@@ he@@ ad and sel@@ ect gover@@ n@@ ment .
Now , hav@@ ing sel@@ ec@@ ted gover@@ n@@ ment , I can now see that the W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia cat@@ eg@@ or@@ ies that most fre@@ qu@@ ent@@ ly cor@@ respon@@ d to that are T@@ im@@ e mag@@ az@@ ine P@@ e@@ ople of the Y@@ e@@ ar .
So this is really important because this is an insi@@ ght that was not con@@ ta@@ in@@ ed with@@ in any one W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia p@@ age .
It &apos;s only possi@@ ble to see that insi@@ ght when you ste@@ p back and look at all of them .
L@@ oo@@ king at one of these partic@@ ular sum@@ mar@@ ies , I can then d@@ ri@@ ll into the conc@@ e@@ pt of T@@ im@@ e mag@@ az@@ ine Per@@ son of the Y@@ e@@ ar ,
br@@ ing@@ ing up all of them .
So looking at these people , I can see that the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity come from gover@@ n@@ ment ; some have come from natur@@ al sci@@ en@@ ces ; some , fe@@ wer still , have come from bus@@ iness --
there &apos;s my b@@ os@@ s --
and one has come from mu@@ sic .
And inter@@ est@@ ing@@ ly enough , B@@ ono is also a TED P@@ ri@@ ze w@@ inn@@ er .
So we can go , j@@ um@@ p , and take a look at all the TED P@@ ri@@ ze w@@ inn@@ ers .
So you see , we &apos;re n@@ av@@ ig@@ ating the we@@ b for the first time as if it &apos;s actually a we@@ b , not from pag@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ p@@ age , but at a hi@@ gh@@ er lev@@ el of ab@@ str@@ ac@@ tion .
And so I want to show you one other thing that may cat@@ ch you a little bit by sur@@ pr@@ i@@ se .
I &apos;m just sho@@ wing the New Yor@@ k T@@ im@@ es w@@ eb@@ s@@ ite here .
So P@@ iv@@ o@@ t , this ap@@ plic@@ ation -- I don &apos;t want to call it a b@@ ro@@ w@@ s@@ er ; it &apos;s really not a b@@ ro@@ w@@ s@@ er , but you can vie@@ w we@@ b pag@@ es with it -- and we br@@ ing that z@@ o@@ om@@ able technology to every sing@@ le we@@ b p@@ age like this .
So I can ste@@ p back , po@@ p right back into a speci@@ fi@@ c sec@@ tion . Now the reas@@ on why this is important is because , by vir@@ tu@@ e of just vie@@ wing we@@ b pag@@ es in this way , I can look at my enti@@ re b@@ ro@@ w@@ s@@ ing h@@ ist@@ ory in the ex@@ act same way .
So I can d@@ ri@@ ll into what I &apos;ve done over speci@@ fi@@ c time fr@@ am@@ es .
Here , in fact , is the state of all the de@@ mo that I just g@@ ave .
And I can sort of re@@ play some stuff that I was looking at ear@@ li@@ er today .
And , if I want to ste@@ p back and look at everything , I can s@@ l@@ ice and dice my h@@ ist@@ ory , per@@ hap@@ s by my se@@ ar@@ ch h@@ ist@@ ory --
here , I was doing some ne@@ pot@@ ist@@ ic se@@ arch@@ ing , looking for B@@ ing , over here for Li@@ ve L@@ ab@@ s P@@ iv@@ o@@ t .
And from these , I can d@@ ri@@ ll into the we@@ b p@@ age and just la@@ un@@ ch them again .
It &apos;s one met@@ ap@@ h@@ or re@@ p@@ ur@@ pos@@ ed m@@ ulti@@ ple times , and in each cas@@ e it ma@@ kes the whole gre@@ ater than the su@@ m of the par@@ ts with the data .
So right now , in this world , we think about data as being this cur@@ se .
We talk about the cur@@ se of inform@@ ation over@@ lo@@ ad .
We talk about d@@ ro@@ w@@ ning in data .
What if we can actually tur@@ n that up@@ side down and tur@@ n the we@@ b up@@ side down , so that in@@ ste@@ ad of n@@ av@@ ig@@ ating from one thing to the next , we get used to the h@@ a@@ bit of being able to go from many things to many things , and then being able to see the p@@ atter@@ ns that were o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se hi@@ d@@ de@@ n ?
If we can do that , then in@@ ste@@ ad of being tr@@ app@@ ed in data , we might actually ex@@ tr@@ act inform@@ ation .
And , in@@ ste@@ ad of de@@ al@@ ing just with inform@@ ation , we can te@@ ase out kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge .
And if we get the kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge , then ma@@ y@@ be even there &apos;s w@@ is@@ do@@ m to be found .
So with that , I th@@ ank you .
E@@ ver@@ y@@ body tal@@ ks about happ@@ iness these d@@ ays .
I had som@@ eb@@ o@@ dy coun@@ t the num@@ ber of b@@ oo@@ ks with &quot; happ@@ iness &quot; in the tit@@ le pub@@ li@@ sh@@ ed in the last fi@@ ve years and they g@@ ave up after about 4@@ 0 , and there were many more .
There is a h@@ u@@ ge w@@ ave of inter@@ est in happ@@ iness , am@@ ong res@@ ear@@ ch@@ ers .
There is a lot of happ@@ iness co@@ ach@@ ing .
E@@ ver@@ y@@ body would like to make people hap@@ pi@@ er .
But in sp@@ ite of all this f@@ loo@@ d of work , there are s@@ ever@@ al c@@ og@@ n@@ iti@@ ve tr@@ ap@@ s that sort of make it al@@ most im@@ possi@@ ble to think str@@ ai@@ ght about happ@@ iness .
And my talk today will be mos@@ tly about these c@@ og@@ n@@ iti@@ ve tr@@ ap@@ s .
This app@@ li@@ es to l@@ ay@@ people thinking about their own happ@@ iness , and it app@@ li@@ es to sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ s thinking about happ@@ iness , because it tur@@ ns out we &apos;re just as m@@ ess@@ ed up as any@@ body el@@ se is .
The first of these tr@@ ap@@ s is a rel@@ uc@@ t@@ ance to ad@@ m@@ it compl@@ ex@@ ity .
It tur@@ ns out that the wor@@ d &quot; happ@@ iness &quot; is just not a us@@ e@@ ful wor@@ d any@@ more , because we app@@ ly it to too many different things .
I think there is one partic@@ ular me@@ an@@ ing to which we might res@@ tr@@ ic@@ t it , but by and lar@@ ge , this is something that we &apos;ll have to give up and we &apos;ll have to ad@@ op@@ t the more compl@@ ic@@ ated vie@@ w of what w@@ ell@@ -@@ being is .
The secon@@ d tra@@ p is a con@@ fu@@ sion between ex@@ peri@@ ence and mem@@ ory ; bas@@ ically , it &apos;s between being happ@@ y in your life , and being happ@@ y about your life or happ@@ y with your life .
And those are two very different conc@@ ep@@ ts , and they &apos;re bot@@ h l@@ um@@ p@@ ed in the not@@ i@@ on of happ@@ iness .
And the th@@ ir@@ d is the f@@ oc@@ using il@@ lu@@ sion , and it &apos;s the un@@ fort@@ un@@ ate fact that we can &apos;t think about any cir@@ c@@ um@@ st@@ ance that aff@@ ects w@@ ell@@ -@@ being with@@ out di@@ stor@@ ting its import@@ ance .
I mean , this is a real c@@ og@@ n@@ iti@@ ve tra@@ p .
There &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
Now , I &apos;d like to start with an example of som@@ eb@@ o@@ dy who had a ques@@ ti@@ on@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ ans@@ wer s@@ es@@ sion after one of my l@@ ec@@ tu@@ res re@@ port@@ ed a story ,
and that was a story -- He said he &apos;d been li@@ st@@ en@@ ing to a sy@@ m@@ ph@@ on@@ y , and it was ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely g@@ l@@ ori@@ ous mu@@ sic and at the very end of the re@@ cor@@ ding , there was a dre@@ ad@@ ful sc@@ re@@ e@@ ch@@ ing s@@ ound .
And then he ad@@ ded , really quite em@@ ot@@ i@@ on@@ ally , it ru@@ in@@ ed the whole ex@@ peri@@ ence .
But it h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t .
What it had ru@@ in@@ ed were the mem@@ or@@ ies of the ex@@ peri@@ ence .
He had had the ex@@ peri@@ ence .
He had had 20 min@@ ut@@ es of g@@ l@@ ori@@ ous mu@@ sic .
They coun@@ ted for no@@ thing because he was le@@ ft with a mem@@ ory ; the mem@@ ory was ru@@ in@@ ed , and the mem@@ ory was all that he had g@@ ott@@ en to ke@@ ep .
What this is tel@@ ling us , really , is that we might be thinking of our@@ selves and of other people in ter@@ ms of two selves .
There is an ex@@ peri@@ en@@ c@@ ing self , who li@@ ves in the pres@@ ent and kno@@ ws the pres@@ ent , is cap@@ able of re@@ -@@ li@@ ving the pas@@ t , but bas@@ ically it has only the pres@@ ent .
It &apos;s the ex@@ peri@@ en@@ c@@ ing self that the d@@ oc@@ t@@ or ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ es -- you know , when the d@@ oc@@ t@@ or as@@ ks , &quot; D@@ o@@ es it h@@ ur@@ t now when I t@@ ou@@ ch you here ? &quot;
And then there is a re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self , and the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self is the one that ke@@ ep@@ s sc@@ ore , and ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ s the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the d@@ oc@@ t@@ or ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ es in as@@ king the question , &quot; How have you been fe@@ el@@ ing l@@ at@@ ely ? &quot;
or &quot; How was your tri@@ p to Al@@ b@@ an@@ ia ? &quot; or something like that .
Th@@ ose are two very different ent@@ ities , the ex@@ peri@@ en@@ c@@ ing self and the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self , and getting con@@ f@@ used between them is part of the m@@ ess about the not@@ i@@ on of happ@@ iness .
Now , the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self is a stor@@ y@@ tel@@ l@@ er .
And that really star@@ ts with a b@@ a@@ sic respon@@ se of our mem@@ or@@ ies -- it star@@ ts im@@ me@@ di@@ at@@ ely .
We don &apos;t only tell stor@@ ies when we se@@ t out to tell stor@@ ies .
O@@ u@@ r mem@@ ory tel@@ ls us stor@@ ies , that is , what we get to ke@@ ep from our ex@@ peri@@ en@@ ces is a story .
And let me beg@@ in with one example .
This is an old stu@@ dy .
Th@@ ose are ac@@ tu@@ al p@@ ati@@ ents under@@ going a pa@@ in@@ ful proc@@ ed@@ ure .
I w@@ on &apos;t go into de@@ ta@@ il . It &apos;s no l@@ ong@@ er pa@@ in@@ ful these d@@ ays , but it was pa@@ in@@ ful when this stu@@ dy was r@@ un in the 19@@ 9@@ 0@@ s .
They were as@@ ked to re@@ por@@ t on their p@@ ain every 6@@ 0 secon@@ ds .
Here are two p@@ ati@@ ents ,
those are their re@@ cor@@ d@@ ings .
And you are as@@ ked , &quot; W@@ ho of them su@@ ff@@ er@@ ed more ? &quot;
And it &apos;s a very e@@ as@@ y question .
C@@ lear@@ ly , P@@ ati@@ ent B su@@ ff@@ er@@ ed more --
his col@@ on@@ os@@ c@@ op@@ y was l@@ ong@@ er , and every min@@ ute of p@@ ain that P@@ ati@@ ent A had , P@@ ati@@ ent B had , and more .
But now there is another question : &quot; How much did these p@@ ati@@ ents think they su@@ ff@@ er@@ ed ? &quot;
And here is a sur@@ pr@@ i@@ se . The sur@@ pr@@ i@@ se is that P@@ ati@@ ent A had a much wor@@ se mem@@ ory of the col@@ on@@ os@@ c@@ op@@ y than P@@ ati@@ ent B@@ .
The stor@@ ies of the col@@ on@@ os@@ co@@ pi@@ es were different , and because a very c@@ rit@@ ical part of the story is how it en@@ ds . And ne@@ i@@ ther of these stor@@ ies is very in@@ spi@@ r@@ ing or great -- but one of them is this dist@@ inc@@ t ... but one of them is dist@@ inc@@ tly wor@@ se than the other .
And the one that is wor@@ se is the one where p@@ ain was at its pe@@ a@@ k at the very end ;
it &apos;s a b@@ ad story .
How do we know that ?
Because we as@@ ked these people after their col@@ on@@ os@@ c@@ op@@ y , and much l@@ ater , too , &quot; How b@@ ad was the whole thing , in t@@ ot@@ al ? &quot;
And it was much wor@@ se for A than for B , in mem@@ ory .
Now this is a di@@ rec@@ t con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t between the ex@@ peri@@ en@@ c@@ ing self and the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self .
F@@ rom the point of vie@@ w of the ex@@ peri@@ en@@ c@@ ing self , c@@ lear@@ ly , B had a wor@@ se time .
Now , what you could do with P@@ ati@@ ent A , and we actually r@@ an cl@@ in@@ ical ex@@ perim@@ ents , and it has been done , and it does work -- you could actually ex@@ ten@@ d the col@@ on@@ os@@ c@@ op@@ y of P@@ ati@@ ent A by just ke@@ ep@@ ing the tu@@ be in with@@ out j@@ ig@@ g@@ ling it too much .
That will c@@ ause the p@@ ati@@ ent to su@@ ff@@ er , but just a little and much less than before .
And if you do that for a cou@@ ple of min@@ ut@@ es , you have made the ex@@ peri@@ en@@ c@@ ing self of P@@ ati@@ ent A wor@@ se off , and you have the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self of P@@ ati@@ ent A a lot better off , because now you have en@@ do@@ w@@ ed P@@ ati@@ ent A with a better story about his ex@@ peri@@ ence .
What defin@@ es a story ?
And that is tru@@ e of the stor@@ ies that mem@@ ory del@@ i@@ ver@@ s for us , and it &apos;s also tru@@ e of the stor@@ ies that we make up . What defin@@ es a story are chang@@ es , signi@@ fic@@ ant mom@@ ents and end@@ ings .
En@@ d@@ ings are very , very important and , in this cas@@ e , the end@@ ing dom@@ in@@ ated .
Now , the ex@@ peri@@ en@@ c@@ ing self li@@ ves its life continu@@ ous@@ ly .
It has mom@@ ents of ex@@ peri@@ ence , one after the other . And you can as@@ k : What happen@@ s to these mom@@ ents ?
And the ans@@ wer is really str@@ ai@@ gh@@ t@@ for@@ w@@ ard :
They are l@@ os@@ t for@@ ever . I mean , most of the mom@@ ents of our life -- and I c@@ alc@@ ul@@ ated , you know , the p@@ sy@@ ch@@ olog@@ ical pres@@ ent is said to be about three secon@@ ds long ; that me@@ ans that , you know , in a life there are about 6@@ 00 million of them ; in a mon@@ th , there are about 6@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,000 -- most of them don &apos;t le@@ ave a tr@@ ace .
M@@ os@@ t of them are complet@@ ely ig@@ nor@@ ed by the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self .
And y@@ et , some@@ how you get the sense that they should coun@@ t , that what happen@@ s dur@@ ing these mom@@ ents of ex@@ peri@@ ence is our life .
It &apos;s the fin@@ ite res@@ our@@ ce that we &apos;re s@@ pen@@ ding wh@@ ile we &apos;re on this ear@@ th .
And how to s@@ pen@@ d it would se@@ e@@ m to be rel@@ ev@@ ant , but that is not the story that the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self ke@@ ep@@ s for us .
So we have the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self and the ex@@ peri@@ en@@ c@@ ing self , and they &apos;re really quite dist@@ inc@@ t .
The bi@@ gg@@ est differ@@ ence between them is in the h@@ and@@ ling of time .
F@@ rom the point of vie@@ w of the ex@@ peri@@ en@@ c@@ ing self , if you have a v@@ ac@@ ation , and the secon@@ d we@@ e@@ k is just as good as the first , then the tw@@ o-@@ we@@ e@@ k v@@ ac@@ ation is tw@@ ice as good as the on@@ e-@@ we@@ e@@ k v@@ ac@@ ation .
That &apos;s not the way it wor@@ ks at all for the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self .
F@@ or the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self , a tw@@ o-@@ we@@ e@@ k v@@ ac@@ ation is bar@@ ely better than the on@@ e-@@ we@@ e@@ k v@@ ac@@ ation because there are no new mem@@ or@@ ies ad@@ ded .
You have not chang@@ ed the story .
And in this way , time is actually the c@@ rit@@ ical v@@ ari@@ able that dist@@ ing@@ u@@ i@@ sh@@ es a re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self from an ex@@ peri@@ en@@ c@@ ing self ;
time has very little imp@@ act on the story .
Now , the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self does more than re@@ mem@@ ber and tell stor@@ ies .
It is actually the one that ma@@ kes deci@@ si@@ ons because , if you have a p@@ ati@@ ent who has had , say , two col@@ on@@ os@@ co@@ pi@@ es with two different sur@@ ge@@ ons and is deci@@ ding which of them to ch@@ o@@ ose , then the one that ch@@ o@@ os@@ es is the one that has the mem@@ ory that is less b@@ ad , and that &apos;s the sur@@ ge@@ on that will be ch@@ os@@ en .
The ex@@ peri@@ en@@ c@@ ing self has no v@@ o@@ ice in this ch@@ o@@ ice .
We actually don &apos;t ch@@ o@@ ose between ex@@ peri@@ en@@ ces , we ch@@ o@@ ose between mem@@ or@@ ies of ex@@ peri@@ en@@ ces .
And even when we think about the fut@@ ure , we don &apos;t think of our fut@@ ure nor@@ m@@ ally as ex@@ peri@@ en@@ ces .
We think of our fut@@ ure as an@@ tic@@ i@@ p@@ ated mem@@ or@@ ies .
And bas@@ ically you can look at this , you know , as a t@@ y@@ ran@@ n@@ y of the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self , and you can think of the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self sort of d@@ rag@@ g@@ ing the ex@@ peri@@ en@@ c@@ ing self through ex@@ peri@@ en@@ ces that the ex@@ peri@@ en@@ c@@ ing self doesn &apos;t need .
I have that sense that when we go on v@@ ac@@ ations this is very fre@@ qu@@ ent@@ ly the cas@@ e ; that is , we go on v@@ ac@@ ations , to a very lar@@ ge ex@@ t@@ ent , in the serv@@ ice of our re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self .
And this is a bit h@@ ard to j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ f@@ y I think .
I mean , how much do we con@@ su@@ me our mem@@ or@@ ies ?
That is one of the ex@@ plan@@ ations that is gi@@ v@@ en for the dom@@ in@@ ance of the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self .
And when I think about that , I think about a v@@ ac@@ ation we had in An@@ t@@ ar@@ c@@ t@@ ica a few years ago , which was c@@ lear@@ ly the b@@ est v@@ ac@@ ation I &apos;ve ever had , and I think of it rel@@ ati@@ vel@@ y o@@ f@@ t@@ en , rel@@ ative to how much I think of other v@@ ac@@ ations .
And I prob@@ ably have con@@ sum@@ ed my mem@@ or@@ ies of that th@@ re@@ e-@@ we@@ e@@ k tri@@ p , I would say , for about 2@@ 5 min@@ ut@@ es in the last four years .
Now , if I had ever op@@ en@@ ed the fol@@ der with the 6@@ 00 pic@@ tu@@ res in it , I would have sp@@ ent another h@@ our . Now , that is three we@@ e@@ ks , and that is at most an h@@ our and a hal@@ f . There se@@ em@@ s to be a disc@@ re@@ pan@@ c@@ y .
Now , I may be a bit ex@@ tr@@ eme , you know , in how little app@@ et@@ ite I have for con@@ sum@@ ing mem@@ or@@ ies , but even if you do more of this , there is a gen@@ u@@ ine question :
Wh@@ y do we put so much we@@ i@@ ght on mem@@ ory rel@@ ative to the we@@ i@@ ght that we put on ex@@ peri@@ en@@ ces ?
So I want you to think about a thought ex@@ perim@@ ent .
I@@ mag@@ ine that for your next v@@ ac@@ ation , you know that at the end of the v@@ ac@@ ation all your pic@@ tu@@ res will be des@@ tro@@ y@@ ed , and you &apos;ll get an am@@ n@@ es@@ ic d@@ ru@@ g so that you w@@ on &apos;t re@@ mem@@ ber any@@ thing .
Now , would you ch@@ o@@ ose the same v@@ ac@@ ation ? And if you would ch@@ o@@ ose a different v@@ ac@@ ation , there is a con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t between your two selves , and you need to think about how to ad@@ j@@ u@@ dic@@ ate that con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t , and it &apos;s actually not at all ob@@ vi@@ ous , because if you think in ter@@ ms of time , then you get one ans@@ wer ,
and if you think in ter@@ ms of mem@@ or@@ ies , you might get another ans@@ wer .
Wh@@ y do we pic@@ k the v@@ ac@@ ations we do is a problem that con@@ fron@@ ts us with a ch@@ o@@ ice between the two selves .
Now , the two selves br@@ ing up two not@@ i@@ ons of happ@@ iness .
There are really two conc@@ ep@@ ts of happ@@ iness that we can app@@ ly , one per self .
So you can as@@ k : How happ@@ y is the ex@@ peri@@ en@@ c@@ ing self ?
And then you would as@@ k : How happ@@ y are the mom@@ ents in the ex@@ peri@@ en@@ c@@ ing self &apos;s life ?
And they &apos;re all -- happ@@ iness for mom@@ ents is a f@@ ai@@ r@@ ly compl@@ ic@@ ated proc@@ ess .
What are the em@@ ot@@ i@@ ons that can be me@@ as@@ u@@ red ?
And , by the way , now we are cap@@ able of getting a pret@@ ty good idea of the happ@@ iness of the ex@@ peri@@ en@@ c@@ ing self over time .
If you as@@ k for the happ@@ iness of the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self , it &apos;s a complet@@ ely different thing .
This is not about how hap@@ pi@@ ly a person li@@ ves .
It is about how s@@ ati@@ s@@ fi@@ ed or pl@@ e@@ as@@ ed the person is when that person thin@@ ks about her life .
V@@ er@@ y different not@@ i@@ on .
An@@ y@@ one who doesn &apos;t dist@@ ing@@ u@@ is@@ h those not@@ i@@ ons is going to m@@ ess up the stu@@ dy of happ@@ iness , and I bel@@ ong to a c@@ ro@@ w@@ d of stud@@ ents of w@@ ell@@ -@@ being , who &apos;ve been m@@ ess@@ ing up the stu@@ dy of happ@@ iness for a long time in pre@@ ci@@ sel@@ y this way .
The dist@@ inc@@ tion between the happ@@ iness of the ex@@ peri@@ en@@ c@@ ing self and the s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion of the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self has been rec@@ og@@ ni@@ zed in rec@@ ent years , and there are now ef@@ for@@ ts to me@@ as@@ ure the two se@@ par@@ at@@ ely . The G@@ all@@ up O@@ r@@ gan@@ i@@ z@@ ation has a world pol@@ l where more than hal@@ f a million people have been as@@ ked ques@@ tions about what they think of their life and about their ex@@ peri@@ en@@ ces ,
and there have been other ef@@ for@@ ts al@@ ong those lin@@ es .
So in rec@@ ent years , we have beg@@ un to lear@@ n about the happ@@ iness of the two selves .
And the ma@@ in l@@ ess@@ on I think that we have lear@@ ned is they are really different .
You can know how s@@ ati@@ s@@ fi@@ ed som@@ eb@@ o@@ dy is with their life , and that really doesn &apos;t te@@ ach you much about how hap@@ pi@@ ly they &apos;re li@@ ving their life , and v@@ ice ver@@ sa .
J@@ ust to give you a sense of the cor@@ rel@@ ation , the cor@@ rel@@ ation is about .@@ 5 .
What that me@@ ans is if you m@@ et som@@ eb@@ o@@ dy , and you were t@@ old , &quot; Oh his fa@@ ther is si@@ x fe@@ et t@@ all , &quot; how much would you know about his he@@ i@@ ght ?
Well , you would know something about his he@@ i@@ ght , but there &apos;s a lot of un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ty .
You have that much un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ty .
If I tell you that som@@ eb@@ o@@ dy ran@@ ked their life ei@@ ght on a sc@@ ale of t@@ en , you have a lot of un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ty about how happ@@ y they are with their ex@@ peri@@ en@@ c@@ ing self .
So the cor@@ rel@@ ation is low .
We know something about what contr@@ ol@@ s s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion of the happ@@ iness self .
We know that money is very important , go@@ als are very important .
We know that happ@@ iness is ma@@ in@@ ly being s@@ ati@@ s@@ fi@@ ed with people that we like , s@@ pen@@ ding time with people that we like .
There are other pl@@ e@@ as@@ u@@ res , but this is dom@@ in@@ ant .
So if you want to ma@@ x@@ im@@ i@@ ze the happ@@ iness of the two selves , you are going to end up doing very different things .
The bot@@ to@@ m line of what I &apos;ve said here is that we really should not think of happ@@ iness as a sub@@ st@@ itu@@ te for w@@ ell@@ -@@ being .
It is a complet@@ ely different not@@ i@@ on .
Now , very qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly , another reas@@ on we can@@ not think str@@ ai@@ ght about happ@@ iness is that we do not at@@ ten@@ d to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live .
So , if you as@@ k the sim@@ ple question of how happ@@ y people are in C@@ ali@@ for@@ n@@ ia , you are not going to get to the cor@@ rec@@ t ans@@ wer .
When you as@@ k that question , you think people m@@ ust be hap@@ pi@@ er in C@@ ali@@ for@@ n@@ ia if , say , you live in O@@ h@@ io .
And what happen@@ s is when you think about li@@ ving in C@@ ali@@ for@@ n@@ ia , you are thinking of the contr@@ ast between C@@ ali@@ for@@ n@@ ia and other pl@@ ac@@ es , and that contr@@ ast , say , is in c@@ lim@@ ate .
Well , it tur@@ ns out that c@@ lim@@ ate is not very important to the ex@@ peri@@ en@@ c@@ ing self and it &apos;s not even very important to the re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tive self that deci@@ de@@ s how happ@@ y people are .
But now , because the re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tive self is in char@@ ge , you may end up -- some people may end up mov@@ ing to C@@ ali@@ for@@ n@@ ia .
And it &apos;s sort of interesting to tr@@ ace what is going to happ@@ en to people who m@@ ove to C@@ ali@@ for@@ n@@ ia in the h@@ ope of getting hap@@ pi@@ er .
Well , their ex@@ peri@@ en@@ c@@ ing self is not going to get hap@@ pi@@ er .
We know that .
But one thing will happ@@ en : They will think they are hap@@ pi@@ er , because , when they think about it , they &apos;ll be re@@ min@@ ded of how h@@ or@@ ri@@ ble the we@@ a@@ ther was in O@@ h@@ io ,
and they will fe@@ el they made the right deci@@ sion .
It is very diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t to think str@@ ai@@ ght about w@@ ell@@ -@@ being , and I h@@ ope I have gi@@ v@@ en you a sense of how diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t it is .
Thank you .
Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : Thank you . I &apos;ve got a question for you .
Thank you so much .
Now , when we were on the ph@@ one a few we@@ e@@ ks ago , you men@@ ti@@ on@@ ed to me that there was quite an interesting res@@ ul@@ t came out of that G@@ all@@ up sur@@ v@@ ey .
I@@ s that something you can sh@@ are sin@@ ce you do have a few mom@@ ents le@@ ft now ?
D@@ an@@ i@@ el K@@ a@@ h@@ n@@ em@@ an : S@@ ure .
I think the most interesting res@@ ul@@ t that we found in the G@@ all@@ up sur@@ v@@ ey is a num@@ ber , which we ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely did not ex@@ p@@ ect to find .
We found that with res@@ p@@ ect to the happ@@ iness of the ex@@ peri@@ en@@ c@@ ing self .
When we loo@@ ked at how fe@@ el@@ ings , v@@ ary with in@@ come . And it tur@@ ns out that , bel@@ ow an in@@ come of 6@@ 0@@ ,000 dollar@@ s a year , for Amer@@ ic@@ ans -- and that &apos;s a very lar@@ ge s@@ am@@ ple of Amer@@ ic@@ ans , like 6@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,000 , so it &apos;s a lar@@ ge re@@ present@@ ative s@@ am@@ ple -- bel@@ ow an in@@ come of 6@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,000 dollar@@ s a year ...
C@@ A : 6@@ 0@@ ,000 . D@@ K : 6@@ 0@@ ,000 . 6@@ 0@@ ,000 dollar@@ s a year , people are un@@ happ@@ y , and they get prog@@ res@@ si@@ vel@@ y un@@ hap@@ pi@@ er the po@@ or@@ er they get . A@@ b@@ ove that , we get an ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely fl@@ at line .
I mean I &apos;ve r@@ ar@@ ely se@@ en lin@@ es so fl@@ at .
C@@ lear@@ ly , what is happen@@ ing is money does not bu@@ y you ex@@ peri@@ enti@@ al happ@@ iness , but l@@ ack of money cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly bu@@ ys you mi@@ ser@@ y , and we can me@@ as@@ ure that mi@@ ser@@ y very , very c@@ lear@@ ly .
In ter@@ ms of the other self , the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self , you get a different story .
The more money you ear@@ n , the more s@@ ati@@ s@@ fi@@ ed you are .
That does not h@@ old for em@@ ot@@ i@@ ons .
C@@ A : But D@@ an@@ n@@ y , the whole Amer@@ ic@@ an en@@ de@@ av@@ or is about life , li@@ ber@@ ty , the p@@ ur@@ su@@ it of happ@@ iness .
If people took ser@@ i@@ ous@@ ly that fin@@ ding , I mean , it se@@ em@@ s to tur@@ n up@@ side down everything we believe about , like for example , ta@@ x@@ ation pol@@ ic@@ y and so for@@ th .
I@@ s there any chan@@ ce that polit@@ ici@@ ans , that the coun@@ try gener@@ ally , would take a fin@@ ding like that ser@@ i@@ ous@@ ly and r@@ un pub@@ li@@ c pol@@ ic@@ y bas@@ ed on it ?
D@@ K : You know I think that there is rec@@ og@@ n@@ ition of the r@@ ole of happ@@ iness res@@ ear@@ ch in pub@@ li@@ c pol@@ ic@@ y .
The rec@@ og@@ n@@ ition is going to be s@@ low in the Un@@ ited St@@ ates , no question about that , but in the U@@ .@@ K@@ . , it is happen@@ ing , and in other coun@@ tri@@ es it is happen@@ ing .
P@@ e@@ ople are rec@@ og@@ ni@@ z@@ ing that they ou@@ ght to be thinking of happ@@ iness when they think of pub@@ li@@ c pol@@ ic@@ y .
It &apos;s going to take a wh@@ ile , and people are going to de@@ b@@ ate wh@@ ether they want to stu@@ dy ex@@ peri@@ ence happ@@ iness , or wh@@ ether they want to stu@@ dy life ev@@ al@@ u@@ ation , so we need to have that de@@ b@@ ate f@@ ai@@ r@@ ly so@@ on .
How to en@@ h@@ ance happ@@ iness go@@ es very different ways de@@ pen@@ ding on how you think , and wh@@ ether you think of the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self or you think of the ex@@ peri@@ en@@ c@@ ing self .
This is going to inf@@ lu@@ ence pol@@ ic@@ y , I think , in years to come .
In the Un@@ ited St@@ ates , ef@@ for@@ ts are being made to me@@ as@@ ure the ex@@ peri@@ ence happ@@ iness of the pop@@ ul@@ ation .
This is going to be , I think , with@@ in the next de@@ c@@ ade or two , part of n@@ ational st@@ ati@@ st@@ ics .
C@@ A : Well , it se@@ em@@ s to me that this is@@ su@@ e will -- or at le@@ ast should be -- the most interesting pol@@ ic@@ y disc@@ us@@ sion to tr@@ ack over the next few years .
Thank you so much for inv@@ ent@@ ing be@@ hav@@ i@@ or@@ al econom@@ ics .
Thank you , D@@ an@@ n@@ y K@@ a@@ h@@ n@@ em@@ an .
I &apos;m going to talk today about energy and c@@ lim@@ ate .
And that might se@@ e@@ m a bit sur@@ pr@@ is@@ ing because my f@@ ul@@ l@@ -@@ time work at the F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation is mos@@ tly about v@@ acc@@ in@@ es and se@@ ed@@ s , about the things that we need to inv@@ ent and del@@ iv@@ er to hel@@ p the po@@ or@@ est two bil@@ lion live better li@@ ves .
But energy and c@@ lim@@ ate are ex@@ trem@@ ely important to these people -- in fact , more important than to any@@ one el@@ se on the plan@@ et .
The c@@ lim@@ ate getting wor@@ se me@@ ans that many years , their cr@@ op@@ s w@@ on &apos;t gro@@ w :
There will be too much ra@@ in , not enough ra@@ in ,
things will change in ways that their fr@@ ag@@ ile en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment sim@@ p@@ ly can &apos;t sup@@ por@@ t .
And that lead@@ s to star@@ v@@ ation , it lead@@ s to un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ty , it lead@@ s to un@@ res@@ t .
So , the c@@ lim@@ ate chang@@ es will be ter@@ ri@@ ble for them .
Al@@ so , the pr@@ ice of energy is very important to them .
In fact , if you could pic@@ k just one thing to lo@@ wer the pr@@ ice of , to re@@ du@@ ce p@@ over@@ ty , by far you would pic@@ k energy .
Now , the pr@@ ice of energy has come down over time .
R@@ e@@ ally ad@@ v@@ anc@@ ed ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation is bas@@ ed on ad@@ v@@ an@@ ces in energy .
The co@@ al re@@ vol@@ ution fu@@ el@@ ed the In@@ d@@ us@@ tri@@ al R@@ evol@@ ution ,
and , even in the 19@@ 0@@ 0@@ s we &apos;ve se@@ en a very rap@@ id de@@ cl@@ ine in the pr@@ ice of el@@ ec@@ tr@@ ic@@ ity , and that &apos;s why we have re@@ fri@@ g@@ er@@ at@@ ors , ai@@ r@@ -@@ con@@ d@@ iti@@ on@@ ing , we can make mo@@ der@@ n materi@@ als and do so many things .
And so , we &apos;re in a w@@ on@@ der@@ ful s@@ itu@@ ation with el@@ ec@@ tr@@ ic@@ ity in the r@@ ich world .
But , as we make it ch@@ e@@ ap@@ er -- and let &apos;s go for making it tw@@ ice as ch@@ ea@@ p -- we need to me@@ et a new con@@ str@@ ain@@ t , and that con@@ str@@ ain@@ t has to do with C@@ O@@ 2 .
C@@ O@@ 2 is war@@ m@@ ing the plan@@ et , and the equ@@ ation on C@@ O@@ 2 is actually a very str@@ ai@@ gh@@ t@@ for@@ w@@ ard one .
If you su@@ m up the C@@ O@@ 2 that g@@ ets em@@ itt@@ ed , that lead@@ s to a tem@@ per@@ at@@ ure incre@@ ase , and that tem@@ per@@ at@@ ure incre@@ ase lead@@ s to some very ne@@ g@@ ative eff@@ ects :
the eff@@ ects on the we@@ a@@ ther ; per@@ hap@@ s wor@@ se , the indi@@ rec@@ t eff@@ ects , in that the natur@@ al ec@@ os@@ y@@ st@@ em@@ s can &apos;t ad@@ just to these rap@@ id chang@@ es , and so you get ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem coll@@ ap@@ s@@ es .
Now , the ex@@ act am@@ oun@@ t of how you ma@@ p from a cer@@ ta@@ in incre@@ ase of C@@ O@@ 2 to what tem@@ per@@ at@@ ure will be and where the pos@@ iti@@ ve fe@@ ed@@ bac@@ ks are , there &apos;s some un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ty there , but not very much .
And there &apos;s cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ty about how b@@ ad those eff@@ ects will be , but they will be ex@@ trem@@ ely b@@ ad .
I as@@ ked the top scienti@@ st@@ s on this s@@ ever@@ al times : D@@ o we really have to get down to ne@@ ar z@@ ero ?
C@@ an &apos;t we just c@@ ut it in hal@@ f or a qu@@ ar@@ ter ?
And the ans@@ wer is that un@@ ti@@ l we get ne@@ ar to z@@ ero , the tem@@ per@@ at@@ ure will continu@@ e to ri@@ se .
And so that &apos;s a big ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge .
It &apos;s very different than s@@ aying &quot; We &apos;re a tw@@ el@@ ve@@ -@@ fo@@ ot@@ -@@ h@@ ig@@ h tr@@ uc@@ k trying to get un@@ der a ten@@ -@@ f@@ oo@@ t bri@@ d@@ ge ,
and we can just sort of s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ ze un@@ der . &quot;
This is something that has to get to z@@ ero .
Now , we put out a lot of car@@ b@@ on di@@ o@@ x@@ i@@ de every year , over 2@@ 6 bil@@ lion t@@ ons .
F@@ or each Amer@@ ic@@ an , it &apos;s about 20 t@@ ons ;
for people in po@@ or coun@@ tri@@ es , it &apos;s less than one t@@ on .
It &apos;s an aver@@ age of about fi@@ ve t@@ ons for every@@ one on the plan@@ et .
And , some@@ how , we have to make chang@@ es that will br@@ ing that down to z@@ ero .
It &apos;s been con@@ st@@ ant@@ ly going up .
It &apos;s only v@@ ari@@ ous econom@@ ic chang@@ es that have even fl@@ at@@ ten@@ ed it at all , so we have to go from rap@@ id@@ ly ris@@ ing to f@@ all@@ ing , and f@@ all@@ ing all the way to z@@ ero .
This equ@@ ation has four fac@@ tor@@ s ,
a little bit of m@@ ulti@@ plic@@ ation :
So , you &apos;ve got a thing on the le@@ ft , C@@ O@@ 2 , that you want to get to z@@ ero , and that &apos;s going to be bas@@ ed on the num@@ ber of people , the serv@@ ic@@ es each person &apos;s using on aver@@ age , the energy on aver@@ age for each serv@@ ice , and the C@@ O@@ 2 being put out per un@@ it of energy .
So , let &apos;s look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to z@@ ero .
P@@ ro@@ b@@ ably , one of these num@@ b@@ ers is going to have to get pret@@ ty ne@@ ar to z@@ ero .
Now that &apos;s back from h@@ ig@@ h sch@@ ool al@@ ge@@ br@@ a ,
but let &apos;s take a look .
F@@ ir@@ st , we &apos;ve got pop@@ ul@@ ation .
The world today has 6@@ .@@ 8 bil@@ lion people .
That &apos;s he@@ a@@ ded up to about n@@ ine bil@@ lion .
Now , if we do a really great jo@@ b on new v@@ acc@@ in@@ es , he@@ al@@ th c@@ are , re@@ produc@@ tive he@@ al@@ th serv@@ ic@@ es , we could lo@@ wer that by , per@@ hap@@ s , 10 or 1@@ 5 percent , but there we see an incre@@ ase of about 1@@ .@@ 3 .
The secon@@ d fac@@ t@@ or is the serv@@ ic@@ es we use .
This en@@ comp@@ ass@@ es everything : the f@@ ood we e@@ at , c@@ lo@@ thing , T@@ V , he@@ ating .
Th@@ ese are very good things : getting ri@@ d of p@@ over@@ ty me@@ ans prov@@ id@@ ing these serv@@ ic@@ es to al@@ most every@@ one on the plan@@ et .
And it &apos;s a great thing for this num@@ ber to go up .
In the r@@ ich world , per@@ hap@@ s the top one bil@@ lion , we prob@@ ably could c@@ ut back and use less , but every year , this num@@ ber , on aver@@ age , is going to go up ,
and so , over all , that will more than d@@ ou@@ ble the serv@@ ic@@ es del@@ i@@ ver@@ ed per person .
Here we have a very b@@ a@@ sic serv@@ ice :
D@@ o you have li@@ gh@@ ting in your h@@ ou@@ se to be able to re@@ ad your h@@ om@@ e@@ work ? And , in fact , these kids don &apos;t , so they &apos;re going out and read@@ ing their sch@@ ool work un@@ der the str@@ e@@ et l@@ am@@ ps .
Now , eff@@ ici@@ en@@ c@@ y , E , the energy for each serv@@ ice , here fin@@ ally we have some good ne@@ ws .
We have something that &apos;s not going up .
Th@@ r@@ ough v@@ ari@@ ous in@@ ven@@ tions and new ways of doing li@@ gh@@ ting , through different t@@ y@@ p@@ es of car@@ s , different ways of building buil@@ d@@ ings -- there are a lot of serv@@ ic@@ es where you can br@@ ing the energy for that serv@@ ice down quite sub@@ st@@ anti@@ ally .
S@@ ome individu@@ al serv@@ ic@@ es even br@@ ing it down by 9@@ 0 percent .
There are other serv@@ ic@@ es like how we make fer@@ ti@@ li@@ z@@ er , or how we do air trans@@ por@@ t , where the ro@@ om@@ s for im@@ prov@@ ement are far , far less .
And so , over@@ all here , if we &apos;re op@@ ti@@ mi@@ st@@ ic , we may get a re@@ d@@ uc@@ tion of a fac@@ t@@ or of three to even , per@@ hap@@ s , a fac@@ t@@ or of si@@ x .
But for these first three fac@@ tor@@ s now , we &apos;ve g@@ one from 2@@ 6 bil@@ lion to , at b@@ est , ma@@ y@@ be 1@@ 3 bil@@ lion t@@ ons ,
and that just w@@ on &apos;t c@@ ut it .
So let &apos;s look at this f@@ our@@ th fac@@ t@@ or -- this is going to be a k@@ ey one -- and this is the am@@ oun@@ t of C@@ O@@ 2 put out per each un@@ it of energy .
And so the question is : C@@ an you actually get that to z@@ ero ?
If you b@@ ur@@ n co@@ al , no .
If you b@@ ur@@ n natur@@ al g@@ as , no .
Al@@ most every way we make el@@ ec@@ tr@@ ic@@ ity today , exc@@ e@@ pt for the em@@ er@@ g@@ ing ren@@ e@@ w@@ ab@@ les and n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar , p@@ ut@@ s out C@@ O@@ 2 .
And so , what we &apos;re going to have to do at a glob@@ al sc@@ ale , is create a new system .
And so , we need energy mi@@ rac@@ les .
Now , when I use the ter@@ m &quot; mi@@ rac@@ le , &quot; I don &apos;t mean something that &apos;s im@@ possi@@ ble .
The m@@ ic@@ ro@@ proc@@ ess@@ or is a mi@@ rac@@ le . The pers@@ onal computer is a mi@@ rac@@ le .
The Inter@@ net and its serv@@ ic@@ es are a mi@@ rac@@ le .
So , the people here have partic@@ i@@ p@@ ated in the cre@@ ation of many mi@@ rac@@ les .
U@@ su@@ ally , we don &apos;t have a de@@ ad@@ line , where you have to get the mi@@ rac@@ le by a cer@@ ta@@ in d@@ ate .
U@@ su@@ ally , you just kind of st@@ and by , and some come al@@ ong , some don &apos;t .
This is a cas@@ e where we actually have to d@@ ri@@ ve at f@@ ul@@ l spe@@ ed and get a mi@@ rac@@ le in a pret@@ ty ti@@ ght tim@@ el@@ ine .
Now , I thought , &quot; How could I really cap@@ ture this ?
I@@ s there some kind of natur@@ al ill@@ us@@ tr@@ ation , some de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation that would gra@@ b people &apos;s imag@@ in@@ ation here ? &quot;
I thought back to a year ago when I br@@ ou@@ ght mos@@ qu@@ it@@ os , and some@@ how people en@@ jo@@ y@@ ed that .
It really got them in@@ vol@@ ved in the idea of , you know , there are people who live with mos@@ qu@@ it@@ os .
So , with energy , all I could come up with is this .
I deci@@ ded that rel@@ e@@ as@@ ing fi@@ re@@ f@@ li@@ es would be my con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion to the en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment here this year .
So here we have some natur@@ al fi@@ re@@ f@@ li@@ es .
I &apos;m t@@ old they don &apos;t b@@ ite ; in fact , they might not even le@@ ave that j@@ ar .
Now , there &apos;s all sor@@ ts of g@@ im@@ m@@ ic@@ k@@ y sol@@ u@@ tions like that one , but they don &apos;t really ad@@ d up to much .
We need sol@@ u@@ tions -- ei@@ ther one or s@@ ever@@ al -- that have un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able sc@@ ale and un@@ beli@@ ev@@ able rel@@ i@@ abil@@ ity , and , al@@ th@@ ough there &apos;s many di@@ rec@@ tions people are se@@ e@@ king , I really only see fi@@ ve that can a@@ chi@@ eve the big num@@ b@@ ers .
I &apos;ve le@@ ft out ti@@ de , ge@@ o@@ ther@@ m@@ al , fu@@ sion , bi@@ o@@ fu@@ el@@ s .
Th@@ ose may make some con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion , and if they can do better than I ex@@ p@@ ect , so much the better , but my k@@ ey point here is that we &apos;re going to have to work on each of these fi@@ ve , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they look d@@ a@@ un@@ ting , because they all have signi@@ fic@@ ant ch@@ all@@ eng@@ es .
L@@ et &apos;s look first at the b@@ ur@@ ning fos@@ si@@ l fu@@ el@@ s , ei@@ ther b@@ ur@@ ning co@@ al or b@@ ur@@ ning natur@@ al g@@ as .
What you need to do there , se@@ em@@ s like it might be sim@@ ple , but it &apos;s not , and that &apos;s to take all the C@@ O@@ 2 , after you &apos;ve b@@ ur@@ ned it , going out the f@@ lu@@ e , pres@@ su@@ ri@@ ze it , create a li@@ qu@@ id , put it some@@ where , and h@@ ope it st@@ ays there .
Now we have some pi@@ lot things that do this at the 6@@ 0 to 8@@ 0 percent lev@@ el , but getting up to that f@@ ul@@ l perc@@ ent@@ age , that will be very tr@@ ic@@ k@@ y , and ag@@ re@@ e@@ ing on where these C@@ O@@ 2 qu@@ ant@@ ities should be put will be h@@ ard ,
but the t@@ ou@@ gh@@ est one here is this l@@ ong@@ -@@ ter@@ m is@@ su@@ e .
W@@ ho &apos;s going to be s@@ ure ?
W@@ ho &apos;s going to guar@@ an@@ te@@ e something that is l@@ it@@ er@@ ally bil@@ li@@ ons of times lar@@ g@@ er than any t@@ y@@ pe of w@@ ast@@ e you think of in ter@@ ms of n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar or other things ?
This is a lot of vol@@ u@@ me .
So that &apos;s a t@@ ough one .
N@@ ex@@ t would be n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar .
It also has three big problem@@ s :
Cos@@ t , partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly in hi@@ gh@@ ly reg@@ ul@@ ated coun@@ tri@@ es , is h@@ ig@@ h ;
the is@@ su@@ e of the s@@ af@@ et@@ y , really fe@@ el@@ ing good about no@@ thing could go wr@@ ong , that , even th@@ ough you have these human oper@@ at@@ ors , that the fu@@ el doesn &apos;t get used for we@@ ap@@ ons .
And then what do you do with the w@@ ast@@ e ?
And , al@@ th@@ ough it &apos;s not very lar@@ ge , there are a lot of con@@ cer@@ ns about that .
P@@ e@@ ople need to fe@@ el good about it .
So three very t@@ ough problem@@ s that might be sol@@ v@@ able , and so , should be wor@@ ked on .
The last three of the fi@@ ve , I &apos;ve gr@@ ou@@ p@@ ed together .
Th@@ ese are what people o@@ f@@ t@@ en re@@ f@@ er to as the ren@@ e@@ w@@ able s@@ our@@ ces .
And they actually -- al@@ th@@ ough it &apos;s great they don &apos;t re@@ qu@@ ire fu@@ el -- they have some dis@@ ad@@ v@@ ant@@ ag@@ es .
One is that the den@@ s@@ ity of energy g@@ a@@ ther@@ ed in these technolog@@ ies is d@@ ram@@ at@@ ically less than a power pl@@ ant .
This is energy far@@ m@@ ing , so you &apos;re tal@@ king about many s@@ qu@@ are mil@@ es , thou@@ s@@ ands of time more ar@@ ea than you think of as a nor@@ m@@ al energy pl@@ ant .
Al@@ so , these are inter@@ m@@ itt@@ ent s@@ our@@ ces .
The s@@ un doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine all day , it doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine every day , and , li@@ ke@@ wi@@ se , the w@@ in@@ d doesn &apos;t b@@ low all the time .
And so , if you de@@ pen@@ d on these s@@ our@@ ces , you have to have some way of getting the energy dur@@ ing those time peri@@ o@@ ds that it &apos;s not av@@ a@@ il@@ able .
So , we &apos;ve got big cos@@ t ch@@ all@@ eng@@ es here ,
we have trans@@ mis@@ sion ch@@ all@@ eng@@ es :
for example , say this energy s@@ our@@ ce is out@@ side your coun@@ try ;
you not only need the technology , but you have to de@@ al with the ris@@ k of the energy coming from el@@ se@@ where .
And , fin@@ ally , this stor@@ age problem .
And , to dimen@@ si@@ on@@ ali@@ ze this , I went through and loo@@ ked at all the t@@ y@@ p@@ es of b@@ atter@@ ies that get made -- for car@@ s , for comput@@ ers , for ph@@ ones , for f@@ las@@ h@@ li@@ gh@@ ts , for everything -- and com@@ par@@ ed that to the am@@ oun@@ t of el@@ ec@@ tr@@ ical energy the world us@@ es , and what I found is that all the b@@ atter@@ ies we make now could st@@ ore less than 10 min@@ ut@@ es of all the energy .
And so , in fact , we need a big bre@@ ak@@ through here , something that &apos;s going to be a fac@@ t@@ or of 100 better than the ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ es we have now .
It &apos;s not im@@ possi@@ ble , but it &apos;s not a very e@@ as@@ y thing .
Now , this sho@@ ws up when you try to get the inter@@ m@@ itt@@ ent s@@ our@@ ce to be ab@@ ove , say , 20 to 30 percent of what you &apos;re using .
If you &apos;re coun@@ ting on it for 100 percent , you need an incredi@@ ble mi@@ rac@@ le b@@ atter@@ y .
Now , how we &apos;re going to go for@@ w@@ ard on this -- what &apos;s the right ap@@ pro@@ ach ?
I@@ s it a M@@ an@@ h@@ att@@ an P@@ ro@@ ject ? What &apos;s the thing that can get us there ?
Well , we need l@@ ots of comp@@ an@@ ies working on this , h@@ un@@ dre@@ ds .
In each of these fi@@ ve pa@@ th@@ s , we need at le@@ ast a h@@ un@@ dre@@ d people .
And a lot of them , you &apos;ll look at and say , &quot; They &apos;re c@@ ra@@ z@@ y . &quot; That &apos;s good .
And , I think , here in the TED gr@@ ou@@ p , we have many people who are al@@ read@@ y p@@ ur@@ su@@ ing this .
B@@ ill Gr@@ os@@ s has s@@ ever@@ al comp@@ an@@ ies , inc@@ lu@@ ding one called e@@ S@@ ol@@ ar that has some great sol@@ ar ther@@ m@@ al technolog@@ ies .
V@@ in@@ od K@@ h@@ os@@ la &apos;s inv@@ esting in do@@ z@@ en@@ s of comp@@ an@@ ies that are doing great things and have interesting possi@@ bil@@ ities , and I &apos;m trying to hel@@ p back that .
N@@ a@@ than M@@ y@@ h@@ r@@ vol@@ d and I actually are bac@@ king a comp@@ any that , per@@ hap@@ s sur@@ pr@@ is@@ ing@@ ly , is actually ta@@ king the n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar ap@@ pro@@ ach .
There are some inn@@ ov@@ ations in n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar : mo@@ d@@ ular , li@@ qu@@ id .
And inn@@ ov@@ ation really st@@ op@@ p@@ ed in this indus@@ try quite some ago , so the idea that there &apos;s some good ide@@ as l@@ aying around is not all that sur@@ pr@@ is@@ ing .
The idea of T@@ er@@ ra@@ P@@ o@@ wer is that , in@@ ste@@ ad of b@@ ur@@ ning a part of ur@@ an@@ i@@ um -- the one percent , which is the U@@ 2@@ 3@@ 5 -- we deci@@ ded , &quot; L@@ et &apos;s b@@ ur@@ n the 9@@ 9 percent , the U@@ 2@@ 3@@ 8 . &quot; It is kind of a c@@ ra@@ z@@ y idea .
In fact , people had tal@@ ked about it for a long time , but they could never sim@@ ul@@ ate pro@@ per@@ ly wh@@ ether it would work or not , and so it &apos;s through the ad@@ v@@ ent of mo@@ der@@ n super@@ comput@@ ers that now you can sim@@ ul@@ ate and see that , y@@ es , with the right materi@@ al &apos;s ap@@ pro@@ ach , this loo@@ ks like it would work .
And , because you &apos;re b@@ ur@@ ning that 9@@ 9 percent , you have gre@@ at@@ ly im@@ prov@@ ed cos@@ t pro@@ fi@@ le .
You actually b@@ ur@@ n up the w@@ ast@@ e , and you can actually use as fu@@ el all the le@@ f@@ t@@ over w@@ ast@@ e from today &apos;s re@@ ac@@ tor@@ s . So , in@@ ste@@ ad of wor@@ r@@ ying about them , you just take that . It &apos;s a great thing .
It bre@@ a@@ th@@ es this ur@@ an@@ i@@ um as it go@@ es al@@ ong , so it &apos;s kind of like a c@@ and@@ le .
You can see it &apos;s a lo@@ g there , o@@ f@@ t@@ en re@@ fer@@ red to as a tr@@ av@@ el@@ ing w@@ ave re@@ ac@@ t@@ or .
In ter@@ ms of fu@@ el , this really sol@@ ves the problem .
I &apos;ve got a pic@@ ture here of a place in K@@ ent@@ uc@@ k@@ y .
This is the le@@ f@@ t@@ over , the 9@@ 9 percent , where they &apos;ve ta@@ k@@ en out the part they b@@ ur@@ n now , so it &apos;s called de@@ pl@@ et@@ ed ur@@ an@@ i@@ um .
That would power the U@@ .@@ S@@ . for h@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of years .
And , sim@@ p@@ ly by fil@@ ter@@ ing se@@ a@@ water in an in@@ ex@@ pen@@ si@@ ve proc@@ ess , you &apos;d have enough fu@@ el for the enti@@ re li@@ fe@@ time of the res@@ t of the plan@@ et .
So , you know , it &apos;s got l@@ ots of ch@@ all@@ eng@@ es a@@ he@@ ad , but it is an example of the many h@@ un@@ dre@@ ds and h@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of ide@@ as that we need to m@@ ove for@@ w@@ ard .
So let &apos;s think : How should we me@@ as@@ ure our@@ selves ?
What should our re@@ por@@ t car@@ d look like ?
Well , let &apos;s go out to where we really need to get , and then look at the inter@@ me@@ di@@ ate .
F@@ or 20@@ 50 , you &apos;ve hear@@ d many people talk about this 8@@ 0 percent re@@ d@@ uc@@ tion . That really is very important , that we get there .
And that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in po@@ or coun@@ tri@@ es , still some ag@@ ric@@ ul@@ ture ,
h@@ op@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly we will have c@@ le@@ an@@ ed up for@@ es@@ try , c@@ ement .
So , to get to that 8@@ 0 percent , the devel@@ op@@ ed coun@@ tri@@ es , inc@@ lu@@ ding coun@@ tri@@ es like Ch@@ ina , will have had to s@@ w@@ it@@ ch their el@@ ec@@ tr@@ ic@@ ity gener@@ ation al@@ together .
So , the other gr@@ ade is : A@@ re we de@@ pl@@ o@@ ying this z@@ er@@ o-@@ em@@ is@@ sion technology ,
have we de@@ pl@@ o@@ y@@ ed it in all the devel@@ op@@ ed coun@@ tri@@ es
and we &apos;re in the proc@@ ess of getting it el@@ se@@ where ?
That &apos;s su@@ per important .
That &apos;s a k@@ ey el@@ ement of making that re@@ por@@ t car@@ d .
So , bac@@ king up from there , what should the 20@@ 20 re@@ por@@ t car@@ d look like ?
Well , again , it should have the two el@@ em@@ ents .
We should go through these eff@@ ici@@ en@@ c@@ y me@@ as@@ u@@ res to start getting re@@ d@@ uc@@ tions :
The less we em@@ it , the less that su@@ m will be of C@@ O@@ 2 , and , ther@@ e@@ fore , the less the tem@@ per@@ at@@ ure .
But in some ways , the gr@@ ade we get there , doing things that don &apos;t get us all the way to the big re@@ d@@ uc@@ tions , is only equ@@ ally , or ma@@ y@@ be even s@@ li@@ gh@@ tly less , important than the other , which is the pi@@ ece of inn@@ ov@@ ation on these bre@@ ak@@ thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ s .
Th@@ ese bre@@ ak@@ thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ s , we need to m@@ ove those at f@@ ul@@ l spe@@ ed , and we can me@@ as@@ ure that in ter@@ ms of comp@@ an@@ ies , pi@@ lot pro@@ j@@ ects , reg@@ ul@@ at@@ ory things that have been chang@@ ed .
There &apos;s a lot of great b@@ oo@@ ks that have been wr@@ itt@@ en about this .
The A@@ l G@@ ore b@@ ook , &quot; O@@ u@@ r Ch@@ o@@ ice &quot; and the D@@ av@@ id M@@ c@@ K@@ ay b@@ ook , &quot; Su@@ st@@ ain@@ able En@@ er@@ g@@ y W@@ i@@ th@@ out the H@@ o@@ t A@@ ir . &quot;
They really go through it and create a fr@@ am@@ e@@ work that this can be disc@@ us@@ s@@ ed b@@ ro@@ ad@@ ly , because we need b@@ ro@@ ad bac@@ king for this .
There &apos;s a lot that has to come together .
So this is a w@@ is@@ h .
It &apos;s a very con@@ cre@@ te w@@ is@@ h that we inv@@ ent this technology .
If you g@@ ave me only one w@@ is@@ h for the next 50 years -- I could pic@@ k who &apos;s pres@@ id@@ ent , I could pic@@ k a v@@ acc@@ ine , which is something I love , or I could pic@@ k that this thing that &apos;s hal@@ f the cos@@ t with no C@@ O@@ 2 g@@ ets inv@@ ent@@ ed -- this is the w@@ is@@ h I would pic@@ k .
This is the one with the gre@@ at@@ est imp@@ act .
If we don &apos;t get this w@@ is@@ h , the divi@@ sion between the people who think sh@@ or@@ t ter@@ m and long ter@@ m will be ter@@ ri@@ ble , between the U@@ .@@ S@@ . and Ch@@ ina , between po@@ or coun@@ tri@@ es and r@@ ich , and most of all the li@@ ves of those two bil@@ lion will be far wor@@ se .
So , what do we have to do ?
What am I ap@@ pe@@ al@@ ing to you to ste@@ p for@@ w@@ ard and d@@ ri@@ ve ?
We need to go for more res@@ ear@@ ch fun@@ ding .
When coun@@ tri@@ es get together in pl@@ ac@@ es like C@@ op@@ en@@ h@@ ag@@ en , they sh@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t just disc@@ us@@ s the C@@ O@@ 2 .
They should disc@@ us@@ s this inn@@ ov@@ ation ag@@ en@@ da , and you &apos;d be st@@ un@@ ned at the ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous@@ ly low lev@@ el@@ s of s@@ pen@@ ding on these inn@@ ov@@ ative ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ es .
We do need the mark@@ et inc@@ enti@@ ves -- C@@ O@@ 2 ta@@ x , ca@@ p and tr@@ ade -- something that g@@ ets that pr@@ ice si@@ gn@@ al out there .
We need to get the m@@ ess@@ age out .
We need to have this di@@ al@@ og@@ ue be a more r@@ ational , more underst@@ and@@ able di@@ al@@ og@@ ue , inc@@ lu@@ ding the ste@@ ps that the gover@@ n@@ ment ta@@ kes .
This is an important w@@ is@@ h , but it is one I think we can a@@ chi@@ eve .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you . So to understand more about T@@ er@@ ra@@ P@@ o@@ wer , right --
I mean , first of all , can you give a sense of what sc@@ ale of inv@@ est@@ ment this is ?
B@@ il G@@ ates : T@@ o actually do the so@@ f@@ tw@@ are , bu@@ y the super@@ computer , h@@ ire all the great scienti@@ st@@ s , which we &apos;ve done , that &apos;s only ten@@ s of mil@@ li@@ ons , and even on@@ ce we t@@ est our materi@@ als out in a R@@ us@@ si@@ an re@@ ac@@ t@@ or to make s@@ ure that our materi@@ als work pro@@ per@@ ly , then you &apos;ll only be up in the h@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of mil@@ li@@ ons .
The t@@ ough thing is building the pi@@ lot re@@ ac@@ t@@ or ; fin@@ ding the s@@ ever@@ al bil@@ lion , fin@@ ding the reg@@ ul@@ at@@ or , the loc@@ ation that will actually buil@@ d the first one of these .
O@@ n@@ ce you get the first one buil@@ t , if it wor@@ ks as ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ s@@ ed , then it &apos;s just c@@ le@@ ar as day , because the econom@@ ics , the energy den@@ s@@ ity , are so different than n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar as we know it .
C@@ A : And so , to understand it right , this in@@ vol@@ ves building de@@ ep into the gr@@ ound al@@ most like a ver@@ tic@@ al kind of col@@ um@@ n of n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar fu@@ el , of this sort of sp@@ ent ur@@ an@@ i@@ um ,
and then the proc@@ ess star@@ ts at the top and kind of wor@@ ks down ?
B@@ G : That &apos;s right . T@@ o@@ day , you &apos;re always re@@ fu@@ el@@ ing the re@@ ac@@ t@@ or , so you have l@@ ots of people and l@@ ots of contr@@ ol@@ s that can go wr@@ ong : that thing where you &apos;re op@@ en@@ ing it up and mov@@ ing things in and out ,
that &apos;s not good .
So , if you have very ch@@ ea@@ p fu@@ el that you can put 6@@ 0 years in -- just think of it as a lo@@ g -- put it down and not have those same compl@@ ex@@ ities .
And it just s@@ its there and b@@ ur@@ ns for the 6@@ 0 years , and then it &apos;s done .
C@@ A : It &apos;s a n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar power pl@@ ant that is its own w@@ ast@@ e dis@@ pos@@ al sol@@ ution .
B@@ G : Y@@ ea@@ h . Well , what happen@@ s with the w@@ ast@@ e , you can let it si@@ t there -- there &apos;s a lot less w@@ ast@@ e un@@ der this ap@@ pro@@ ach -- then you can actually take that , and put it into another one and b@@ ur@@ n that .
And we start off actually by ta@@ king the w@@ ast@@ e that ex@@ ist@@ s today , that &apos;s s@@ itt@@ ing in these co@@ ol@@ ing po@@ ol@@ s or d@@ ry cas@@ king by re@@ ac@@ tor@@ s --
that &apos;s our fu@@ el to beg@@ in with .
So , the thing that &apos;s been a problem from those re@@ ac@@ tor@@ s is actually what g@@ ets f@@ ed into our@@ s , and you &apos;re re@@ d@@ uc@@ ing the vol@@ u@@ me of the w@@ ast@@ e quite d@@ ram@@ at@@ ically as you &apos;re going through this proc@@ ess .
C@@ A : I mean , you &apos;re tal@@ king to different people around the world about the possi@@ bil@@ ities here . W@@ here is there most inter@@ est in actually doing something with this ?
B@@ G : Well , we hav@@ en &apos;t pic@@ ked a partic@@ ular place , and there &apos;s all these interesting disc@@ l@@ os@@ ure r@@ ul@@ es about any@@ thing that &apos;s called &quot; n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar , &quot; so we &apos;ve got a lot of inter@@ est ,
that people from the comp@@ any have been in R@@ us@@ sia , India , Ch@@ ina --
I &apos;ve been back se@@ e@@ ing the sec@@ ret@@ ary of energy here ,
tal@@ king about how this f@@ its into the energy ag@@ en@@ da .
So I &apos;m op@@ ti@@ mi@@ st@@ ic . You know , the F@@ ren@@ ch and J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese have done some work .
This is a v@@ ari@@ ant on something that has been done .
It &apos;s an important ad@@ v@@ ance , but it &apos;s like a f@@ ast re@@ ac@@ t@@ or , and a lot of coun@@ tri@@ es have buil@@ t them , so any@@ body who &apos;s done a f@@ ast re@@ ac@@ t@@ or is a can@@ di@@ d@@ ate to be where the first one g@@ ets buil@@ t .
C@@ A : So , in your min@@ d , tim@@ es@@ c@@ ale and li@@ k@@ el@@ i@@ h@@ ood of actually ta@@ king something like this live ?
B@@ G : Well , we need -- for one of these hi@@ gh@@ -@@ sc@@ ale , el@@ ec@@ tro@@ -@@ gener@@ ation things that &apos;s very ch@@ ea@@ p , we have 20 years to inv@@ ent and then 20 years to de@@ pl@@ o@@ y .
That &apos;s sort of the de@@ ad@@ line that the en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment@@ al model@@ s have sho@@ wn us that we have to me@@ et .
And , you know , T@@ er@@ ra@@ P@@ o@@ wer , if things go well -- which is wi@@ sh@@ ing for a lot -- could ea@@ si@@ ly me@@ et that .
And there are , fort@@ un@@ at@@ ely now , do@@ z@@ en@@ s of comp@@ an@@ ies -- we need it to be h@@ un@@ dre@@ ds -- who , li@@ ke@@ wi@@ se , if their sci@@ ence go@@ es well , if the fun@@ ding for their pi@@ lot plan@@ ts go@@ es well , that they can com@@ pe@@ te for this .
And it &apos;s b@@ est if m@@ ulti@@ ple succ@@ e@@ ed , because then you could use a mi@@ x of these things .
We cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly need one to succ@@ e@@ ed .
C@@ A : In ter@@ ms of bi@@ g@@ -@@ sc@@ ale possi@@ ble g@@ ame chang@@ es , is this the bi@@ gg@@ est that you &apos;re aw@@ are of out there ?
B@@ G : A@@ n energy bre@@ ak@@ through is the most important thing .
It would have been , even with@@ out the en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment@@ al con@@ str@@ ain@@ t , but the en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment@@ al con@@ str@@ ain@@ t just ma@@ kes it so much gre@@ ater .
In the n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar space , there are other inn@@ ov@@ at@@ ors .
You know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as we know this one , but the mo@@ d@@ ular people , that &apos;s a different ap@@ pro@@ ach .
There &apos;s a li@@ qu@@ id@@ -@@ t@@ y@@ pe re@@ ac@@ t@@ or , which se@@ em@@ s a little h@@ ard , but ma@@ y@@ be they say that about us .
And so , there are different ones , but the be@@ aut@@ y of this is a mol@@ ec@@ u@@ le of ur@@ an@@ i@@ um has a million times as much energy as a mol@@ ec@@ u@@ le of , say , co@@ al , and so -- if you can de@@ al with the ne@@ g@@ ati@@ ves , which are ess@@ enti@@ ally the ra@@ di@@ ation -- the fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int and cos@@ t , the pot@@ enti@@ al , in ter@@ ms of eff@@ ect on land and v@@ ari@@ ous things , is al@@ most in a c@@ las@@ s of its own .
C@@ A : If this doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
D@@ o we have to start ta@@ king em@@ er@@ gen@@ c@@ y me@@ as@@ u@@ res to try and ke@@ ep the tem@@ per@@ at@@ ure of the ear@@ th st@@ able ?
B@@ G : If you get into that s@@ itu@@ ation , it &apos;s like if you &apos;ve been over@@ -@@ e@@ ating , and you &apos;re about to have a hear@@ t att@@ ack :
Th@@ en where do you go ? You may need hear@@ t sur@@ g@@ er@@ y or something .
There is a line of res@@ ear@@ ch on what &apos;s called ge@@ o@@ eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ing , which are v@@ ari@@ ous tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es that would del@@ ay the he@@ ating to bu@@ y us 20 or 30 years to get our act together .
Now , that &apos;s just an in@@ sur@@ ance pol@@ ic@@ y .
You h@@ ope you don &apos;t need to do that .
S@@ ome people say you sh@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t even work on the in@@ sur@@ ance pol@@ ic@@ y because it might make you la@@ z@@ y , that you &apos;ll ke@@ ep e@@ ating because you know hear@@ t sur@@ g@@ er@@ y will be there to s@@ ave you .
I &apos;m not s@@ ure that &apos;s wi@@ se , gi@@ v@@ en the import@@ ance of the problem , but there &apos;s now the ge@@ o@@ eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ing disc@@ us@@ sion about -- should that be in the back p@@ oc@@ k@@ et in cas@@ e things happ@@ en f@@ ast@@ er , or this inn@@ ov@@ ation go@@ es a lot s@@ lo@@ wer than we ex@@ p@@ ect ?
C@@ A : C@@ lim@@ ate sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ s : If you had a s@@ ent@@ ence or two to say to them , how might you per@@ su@@ ade them that they &apos;re wr@@ ong ?
B@@ G : Well , un@@ fort@@ un@@ at@@ ely , the sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ s come in different cam@@ ps . The ones who make scienti@@ fi@@ c ar@@ g@@ um@@ ents are very few .
A@@ re they s@@ aying that there &apos;s ne@@ g@@ ative fe@@ ed@@ back eff@@ ects that have to do with cl@@ ou@@ ds that off@@ se@@ t things ?
There are very , very few things that they can even say there &apos;s a chan@@ ce in a million of those things . The ma@@ in problem we have here , it &apos;s kind of like A@@ I@@ D@@ S .
You make the mi@@ st@@ a@@ ke now , and you p@@ ay for it a lot l@@ ater .
And so , when you have all sor@@ ts of ur@@ g@@ ent problem@@ s , the idea of ta@@ king p@@ ain now that has to do with a g@@ ain l@@ ater ,
and a some@@ what un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in p@@ ain thing --
in fact , the I@@ P@@ C@@ C re@@ por@@ t , that &apos;s not nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly the wor@@ st cas@@ e , and there are people in the r@@ ich world who look at I@@ P@@ C@@ C and say , &quot; OK , that is@@ n &apos;t that big of a de@@ al . &quot;
The fact is it &apos;s that un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in part that should m@@ ove us to@@ war@@ ds this .
But my dre@@ am here is that , if you can make it econom@@ ic , and me@@ et the C@@ O@@ 2 con@@ str@@ ain@@ ts , then the sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ s say , &quot; OK , I don &apos;t c@@ are that it doesn &apos;t put out C@@ O@@ 2 , I kind of w@@ is@@ h it did put out C@@ O@@ 2 , but I gu@@ ess I &apos;ll acc@@ e@@ pt it because it &apos;s ch@@ e@@ ap@@ er than what &apos;s come before . &quot;
C@@ A : And so , that would be your respon@@ se to the B@@ j@@ or@@ n L@@ om@@ bor@@ g ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent , that bas@@ ically if you s@@ pen@@ d all this energy trying to sol@@ ve the C@@ O@@ 2 problem , it &apos;s going to take away all your other go@@ als of trying to ri@@ d the world of p@@ over@@ ty and mal@@ aria and so for@@ th , it &apos;s a stu@@ pi@@ d w@@ ast@@ e of the Ear@@ th &apos;s res@@ our@@ ces to put money to@@ war@@ ds that when there are better things we can do .
B@@ G : Well , the ac@@ tu@@ al s@@ pen@@ ding on the R &@@ am@@ p@@ ; am@@ p ; D pi@@ ece --
say the U@@ .@@ S@@ . should s@@ pen@@ d 10 bil@@ lion a year more than it is right now -- it &apos;s not that d@@ ram@@ ati@@ c .
It sh@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t take away from other things .
The thing you get into big money on , and this , reas@@ on@@ able people can dis@@ ag@@ ree , is when you have something that &apos;s n@@ on@@ -@@ econom@@ ic and you &apos;re trying to fun@@ d that --
that , to me , mos@@ tly is a w@@ ast@@ e .
Un@@ less you &apos;re very cl@@ ose and you &apos;re just fun@@ ding the lear@@ ning cur@@ ve and it &apos;s going to get very ch@@ ea@@ p , I believe we should try more things that have a pot@@ enti@@ al to be far less ex@@ pen@@ si@@ ve .
If the tra@@ de@@ -@@ off you get into is , &quot; L@@ et &apos;s make energy su@@ per ex@@ pen@@ si@@ ve , &quot; then the r@@ ich can af@@ for@@ d that . I mean , all of us here could p@@ ay fi@@ ve times as much for our energy and not change our li@@ f@@ est@@ y@@ le .
The dis@@ ast@@ er is for that two bil@@ lion .
And even L@@ om@@ bor@@ g has chang@@ ed .
H@@ is sh@@ tic@@ k now is , &quot; Wh@@ y is@@ n &apos;t the R &@@ am@@ p@@ ; am@@ p ; D getting more disc@@ us@@ s@@ ed ? &quot;
He &apos;s still , because of his ear@@ li@@ er stuff , still as@@ soci@@ ated with the sk@@ ep@@ ti@@ c cam@@ p , but he &apos;s re@@ ali@@ zed that &apos;s a pret@@ ty l@@ on@@ ely cam@@ p , and so , he &apos;s making the R &@@ am@@ p@@ ; am@@ p ; D point .
And so there is a th@@ re@@ ad of something that I think is ap@@ propr@@ i@@ ate .
The R &@@ am@@ p@@ ; am@@ p ; D pi@@ ece , it &apos;s c@@ ra@@ z@@ y how little it &apos;s fun@@ ded .
C@@ A : Well B@@ ill , I s@@ us@@ p@@ ect I spe@@ a@@ k on the be@@ hal@@ f of most people here to say I really h@@ ope your w@@ is@@ h comes tru@@ e . Thank you so much .
B@@ G : Thank you .
I &apos;d like to sh@@ are with you a disc@@ over@@ y that I made a few mon@@ th@@ s ago wh@@ ile w@@ rit@@ ing an ar@@ tic@@ le for I@@ t@@ ali@@ an W@@ i@@ red .
I always ke@@ ep my th@@ es@@ a@@ ur@@ us h@@ and@@ y wh@@ en@@ ever I &apos;m w@@ rit@@ ing any@@ thing , but I &apos;d al@@ read@@ y fin@@ i@@ sh@@ ed ed@@ it@@ ing the pi@@ ece , and I re@@ ali@@ zed that I had never on@@ ce in my life loo@@ ked up the wor@@ d &quot; dis@@ ab@@ l@@ ed &quot; to see what I &apos;d find .
L@@ et me re@@ ad you the entr@@ y .
&quot; D@@ is@@ ab@@ l@@ ed , ad@@ j@@ ec@@ tive : cri@@ p@@ pl@@ ed , hel@@ pl@@ ess , us@@ el@@ ess , w@@ rec@@ ked , st@@ all@@ ed , ma@@ im@@ ed , w@@ oun@@ ded , man@@ g@@ l@@ ed , l@@ ame , mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ated , r@@ un@@ -@@ down , wor@@ n@@ -@@ out , we@@ ak@@ en@@ ed , im@@ pot@@ ent , cas@@ tr@@ ated , par@@ al@@ y@@ zed , h@@ and@@ ic@@ app@@ ed , sen@@ ile , de@@ cre@@ p@@ it , l@@ ai@@ d@@ -@@ up , don@@ e-@@ up , don@@ e-@@ for , don@@ e-@@ in cr@@ ac@@ k@@ ed@@ -@@ up , coun@@ t@@ ed@@ -@@ out ; see also h@@ ur@@ t , us@@ el@@ ess and we@@ a@@ k .
An@@ t@@ on@@ y@@ ms , he@@ al@@ th@@ y , str@@ ong , cap@@ able . &quot;
I was read@@ ing this li@@ st out l@@ ou@@ d to a fri@@ end and at first was l@@ au@@ gh@@ ing , it was so lu@@ dic@@ r@@ ous , but I &apos;d just g@@ ott@@ en pas@@ t &quot; man@@ g@@ l@@ ed , &quot; and my v@@ o@@ ice b@@ ro@@ ke , and I had to st@@ op and coll@@ ect m@@ y@@ self from the em@@ ot@@ i@@ onal sh@@ oc@@ k and imp@@ act that the ass@@ a@@ ul@@ t from these wor@@ ds un@@ le@@ as@@ h@@ ed .
You know , of course , this is my rag@@ g@@ ed@@ y old th@@ es@@ a@@ ur@@ us
so I &apos;m thinking this m@@ ust be an an@@ ci@@ ent pr@@ int d@@ ate , right ?
But , in fact , the pr@@ int d@@ ate was the ear@@ ly 19@@ 8@@ 0@@ s ,
when I would have been star@@ ting prim@@ ary sch@@ ool and form@@ ing an underst@@ and@@ ing of m@@ y@@ self out@@ side the fami@@ ly un@@ it and as rel@@ ated to the other kids and the world around me .
And , ne@@ ed@@ less to say , th@@ ank G@@ od I w@@ as@@ n &apos;t using a th@@ es@@ a@@ ur@@ us back then .
I mean , from this entr@@ y , it would se@@ e@@ m that I was bor@@ n into a world that perc@@ e@@ iv@@ ed some@@ one like me to have no@@ thing pos@@ iti@@ ve wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever going for them , when in fact , today I &apos;m cel@@ e@@ br@@ ated for the opportun@@ ities and ad@@ vent@@ u@@ res my life has pro@@ cu@@ red .
So , I im@@ me@@ di@@ at@@ ely went to look up the 200@@ 9 on@@ line ed@@ ition , ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ting to find a re@@ vi@@ sion wor@@ th not@@ ing .
Here &apos;s the up@@ d@@ ated ver@@ sion of this entr@@ y .
Un@@ fort@@ un@@ at@@ ely , it &apos;s not much better .
I find the last two wor@@ ds un@@ der &quot; Ne@@ ar An@@ t@@ on@@ y@@ ms , &quot; partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly un@@ s@@ ett@@ ling : &quot; whole &quot; and &quot; wh@@ ol@@ es@@ ome . &quot; So , it &apos;s not just about the wor@@ ds .
It &apos;s what we believe about people when we n@@ ame them with these wor@@ ds .
It &apos;s about the val@@ u@@ es be@@ h@@ in@@ d the wor@@ ds , and how we con@@ struc@@ t those val@@ u@@ es .
O@@ u@@ r lan@@ gu@@ age aff@@ ects our thinking and how we vie@@ w the world and how we vie@@ w other people .
In fact , many an@@ ci@@ ent soci@@ e@@ ti@@ es , inc@@ lu@@ ding the G@@ re@@ e@@ ks and the R@@ om@@ ans , beli@@ ev@@ ed that to ut@@ ter a cur@@ se ver@@ b@@ ally was so po@@ w@@ er@@ ful , because to say the thing out l@@ ou@@ d br@@ ou@@ ght it into ex@@ ist@@ ence .
So , what real@@ ity do we want to call into ex@@ ist@@ ence : a person who is lim@@ ited , or a person who &apos;s em@@ po@@ w@@ er@@ ed ?
B@@ y cas@@ u@@ ally doing something as sim@@ ple as n@@ am@@ ing a person , a chil@@ d , we might be p@@ utt@@ ing li@@ ds and c@@ ast@@ ing sh@@ ad@@ o@@ ws on their power .
W@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t we want to op@@ en do@@ ors for them in@@ ste@@ ad ?
One su@@ ch person who op@@ en@@ ed do@@ ors for me was my chil@@ d@@ h@@ ood d@@ oc@@ t@@ or at the A@@ .@@ I@@ . du@@ P@@ on@@ t In@@ st@@ itu@@ te in W@@ il@@ m@@ ing@@ t@@ on , D@@ el@@ aw@@ are .
H@@ is n@@ ame was D@@ r@@ . P@@ i@@ zz@@ uti@@ l@@ lo ,
an I@@ t@@ ali@@ an Amer@@ ic@@ an , wh@@ ose n@@ ame , ap@@ par@@ ent@@ ly , was too diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t for most Amer@@ ic@@ ans to pr@@ on@@ oun@@ ce , so he went by D@@ r@@ . P@@ .
And D@@ r@@ . P always w@@ ore really col@@ or@@ ful b@@ ow ti@@ es and had the very per@@ f@@ ect dis@@ pos@@ ition to work with children .
I l@@ ov@@ ed al@@ most everything about my time sp@@ ent at this h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ al , with the exc@@ ep@@ tion of my ph@@ y@@ s@@ ical ther@@ ap@@ y s@@ essi@@ ons .
I had to do what se@@ em@@ ed like in@@ num@@ er@@ able re@@ p@@ et@@ iti@@ ons of ex@@ er@@ ci@@ s@@ es with these th@@ ick , el@@ ast@@ ic b@@ ands -- different col@@ ors , you know -- to hel@@ p buil@@ d up my le@@ g mus@@ c@@ les ,
and I h@@ ated these b@@ ands more than any@@ thing --
I h@@ ated them , had n@@ am@@ es for them . I h@@ ated them .
And , you know , I was al@@ read@@ y bar@@ g@@ ain@@ ing , as a fi@@ ve year@@ -@@ old chil@@ d , with D@@ r@@ . P to try to get out of doing these ex@@ er@@ ci@@ s@@ es , un@@ succ@@ ess@@ f@@ ul@@ ly , of course .
And , one day , he came in to my s@@ es@@ sion -- ex@@ h@@ au@@ st@@ i@@ ve and un@@ for@@ gi@@ ving , these s@@ essi@@ ons --
and he said to me , &quot; W@@ ow . A@@ im@@ ee , you are su@@ ch a str@@ ong and po@@ w@@ er@@ ful little gir@@ l , I think you &apos;re going to bre@@ a@@ k one of those b@@ ands .
When you do bre@@ a@@ k it , I &apos;m going to give you a h@@ un@@ dre@@ d b@@ uc@@ ks . &quot;
Now , of course , this was a sim@@ ple pl@@ o@@ y on D@@ r@@ . P &apos;s part to get me to do the ex@@ er@@ ci@@ s@@ es I didn &apos;t want to do before the pros@@ p@@ ect of being the ri@@ ch@@ est fi@@ ve@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old in the secon@@ d f@@ lo@@ or w@@ ard , but what he eff@@ ec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y did for me was res@@ hap@@ e an aw@@ ful d@@ ai@@ ly oc@@ cur@@ r@@ ence
into a new and pr@@ om@@ is@@ ing ex@@ peri@@ ence for me .
And I have to w@@ on@@ der today to what ex@@ t@@ ent his vi@@ sion and his de@@ c@@ lar@@ ation of me as a str@@ ong and po@@ w@@ er@@ ful little gir@@ l sh@@ ap@@ ed my own vie@@ w of m@@ y@@ self as an in@@ h@@ er@@ ent@@ ly str@@ ong , po@@ w@@ er@@ ful and a@@ th@@ le@@ ti@@ c person well into the fut@@ ure .
This is an example of how ad@@ ul@@ ts in pos@@ iti@@ ons of power can ig@@ n@@ ite the power of a chil@@ d .
But , in the pre@@ vi@@ ous inst@@ an@@ ces of those th@@ es@@ a@@ ur@@ us entr@@ ies , our lan@@ gu@@ age is@@ n &apos;t al@@ lo@@ wing us to evol@@ ve into the real@@ ity that we would all want , the possi@@ bil@@ ity of an individu@@ al to see th@@ em@@ selves as cap@@ able .
O@@ u@@ r lan@@ gu@@ age h@@ as@@ n &apos;t c@@ au@@ ght up with the chang@@ es in our soci@@ et@@ y , many of which have been br@@ ou@@ ght about by technology .
C@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ ly , from a me@@ dic@@ al st@@ and@@ point , my leg@@ s , las@@ er sur@@ g@@ er@@ y for vi@@ sion imp@@ ai@@ r@@ ment , tit@@ an@@ i@@ um k@@ ne@@ es and hi@@ p re@@ pl@@ ac@@ em@@ ents for ag@@ ing bo@@ di@@ es that are al@@ lo@@ wing people to more f@@ ul@@ ly eng@@ age with their abil@@ ities , and m@@ ove be@@ y@@ on@@ d the lim@@ its that nat@@ ure has im@@ pos@@ ed on them -- not to men@@ tion soci@@ al n@@ et@@ working pl@@ at@@ form@@ s al@@ low people to sel@@ f@@ -@@ id@@ enti@@ f@@ y , to cl@@ ai@@ m their own des@@ cri@@ p@@ tions of th@@ em@@ selves , so they can go al@@ ig@@ n with glob@@ al gr@@ ou@@ ps of their own ch@@ o@@ os@@ ing .
So , per@@ hap@@ s technology is re@@ ve@@ al@@ ing more c@@ lear@@ ly to us now what has always been a tr@@ ut@@ h : that every@@ one has something r@@ are and po@@ w@@ er@@ ful to off@@ er our soci@@ et@@ y , and that the human abil@@ ity to ad@@ ap@@ t is our gre@@ at@@ est as@@ se@@ t .
The human abil@@ ity to ad@@ ap@@ t , it &apos;s an interesting thing , because people have continu@@ ally wanted to talk to me about over@@ coming ad@@ ver@@ s@@ ity , and I &apos;m going to make an ad@@ mis@@ sion :
This ph@@ r@@ ase never s@@ at right with me , and I always fel@@ t un@@ e@@ as@@ y trying to ans@@ wer people &apos;s ques@@ tions about it , and I think I &apos;m star@@ ting to fi@@ g@@ ure out why .
I@@ m@@ plic@@ it in this ph@@ r@@ ase of &quot; over@@ coming ad@@ ver@@ s@@ ity &quot; is the idea that succ@@ ess , or happ@@ iness , is about em@@ er@@ g@@ ing on the other side of a ch@@ all@@ eng@@ ing ex@@ peri@@ ence un@@ sc@@ a@@ th@@ ed or un@@ mar@@ ked by the ex@@ peri@@ ence , as if my succ@@ ess@@ es in life have come about from an abil@@ ity to si@@ des@@ te@@ p or cir@@ c@@ um@@ n@@ av@@ ig@@ ate the pres@@ um@@ ed p@@ it@@ f@@ all@@ s of a life with pros@@ th@@ et@@ ics , or what other people perc@@ ei@@ ve as my dis@@ abil@@ ity .
But , in fact , we are chang@@ ed . We are mar@@ ked , of course , by a ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge , wh@@ ether ph@@ y@@ sic@@ ally , em@@ ot@@ i@@ on@@ ally or bot@@ h .
And I &apos;m going to su@@ gg@@ est that this is a good thing .
A@@ d@@ ver@@ s@@ ity is@@ n &apos;t an ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le that we need to get around in ord@@ er to res@@ u@@ me li@@ ving our life .
It &apos;s part of our life .
And I ten@@ d to think of it like my sh@@ ad@@ ow .
S@@ om@@ e@@ times I see a lot of it , some@@ times there &apos;s very little , but it &apos;s always with me .
And , cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly , I &apos;m not trying to di@@ min@@ is@@ h the imp@@ act , the we@@ i@@ ght , of a person &apos;s str@@ u@@ gg@@ le .
There is ad@@ ver@@ s@@ ity and ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge in life , and it &apos;s all very real and rel@@ ative to every sing@@ le person , but the question is@@ n &apos;t wh@@ ether or not you &apos;re going to me@@ et ad@@ ver@@ s@@ ity , but how you &apos;re going to me@@ et it .
So , our respon@@ si@@ bil@@ ity is not sim@@ p@@ ly shi@@ el@@ ding those we c@@ are for from ad@@ ver@@ s@@ ity , but pre@@ par@@ ing them to me@@ et it well .
And we do a dis@@ serv@@ ice to our kids when we make them fe@@ el that they &apos;re not equ@@ i@@ p@@ p@@ ed to ad@@ ap@@ t .
There &apos;s an important differ@@ ence and dist@@ inc@@ tion between the ob@@ j@@ ec@@ tive me@@ dic@@ al fact of my being an am@@ p@@ ut@@ ee and the sub@@ j@@ ec@@ tive soci@@ et@@ al op@@ in@@ i@@ on of wh@@ ether or not I &apos;m dis@@ ab@@ l@@ ed .
And , tru@@ th@@ f@@ ul@@ ly , the only real and con@@ sist@@ ent dis@@ abil@@ ity I &apos;ve had to con@@ fron@@ t is the world ever thinking that I could be des@@ cri@@ b@@ ed by those defin@@ iti@@ ons .
In our des@@ ire to prot@@ ect those we c@@ are about by gi@@ ving them the col@@ d , h@@ ard tr@@ ut@@ h about their me@@ dic@@ al prog@@ n@@ os@@ is , or , in@@ de@@ ed , a prog@@ n@@ os@@ is on the ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ted qual@@ ity of their life , we have to make s@@ ure that we don &apos;t put the first br@@ ick in a w@@ all that will actually dis@@ able some@@ one .
Per@@ hap@@ s the ex@@ ist@@ ing mo@@ del of only looking at what is b@@ ro@@ k@@ en in you and how do we fi@@ x it , ser@@ ves to be more dis@@ ab@@ ling to the individu@@ al than the pa@@ th@@ olog@@ y it@@ self .
B@@ y not tre@@ ating the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess of a person , by not ac@@ kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ g@@ ing their pot@@ en@@ c@@ y , we are cre@@ ating another ill on top of wh@@ at@@ ever natur@@ al str@@ u@@ gg@@ le they might have .
We are eff@@ ec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y gr@@ ad@@ ing some@@ one &apos;s wor@@ th to our commun@@ ity .
So we need to see through the pa@@ th@@ olog@@ y and into the ran@@ ge of human cap@@ abil@@ ity .
And , most import@@ ant@@ ly , there &apos;s a par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ shi@@ p between those perc@@ e@@ iv@@ ed de@@ fic@@ i@@ en@@ ci@@ es and our gre@@ at@@ est cre@@ ative abil@@ ity .
So it &apos;s not about de@@ val@@ u@@ ing , or ne@@ g@@ ating , these more trying times as something we want to av@@ o@@ id or s@@ we@@ ep un@@ der the ru@@ g , but in@@ ste@@ ad to find those opportun@@ ities w@@ rap@@ p@@ ed in the ad@@ ver@@ s@@ ity .
So ma@@ y@@ be the idea I want to put out there is not so much over@@ coming ad@@ ver@@ s@@ ity as it is op@@ en@@ ing our@@ selves up to it , em@@ br@@ ac@@ ing it , gr@@ ap@@ pl@@ ing with it , to use a w@@ res@@ t@@ ling ter@@ m , ma@@ y@@ be even d@@ anc@@ ing with it .
And , per@@ hap@@ s , if we see ad@@ ver@@ s@@ ity as natur@@ al , con@@ sist@@ ent and us@@ e@@ ful , we &apos;re less b@@ ur@@ den@@ ed by the pres@@ ence of it .
This year we cel@@ e@@ br@@ ate the 200@@ th bi@@ r@@ th@@ day of Ch@@ ar@@ les D@@ ar@@ w@@ in , and it was 1@@ 50 years ago , when w@@ rit@@ ing about evol@@ ution , that D@@ ar@@ w@@ in ill@@ us@@ tr@@ ated , I think , a tr@@ ut@@ h about the human char@@ ac@@ ter .
T@@ o par@@ ap@@ h@@ r@@ ase : It &apos;s not the str@@ ong@@ est of the speci@@ es that sur@@ vi@@ ves , n@@ or is it the most intelli@@ g@@ ent that sur@@ vi@@ ves ; it is the one that is most ad@@ ap@@ t@@ able to change .
Con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t is the gen@@ es@@ is of cre@@ ation .
F@@ rom D@@ ar@@ w@@ in &apos;s work , am@@ ong@@ st o@@ th@@ ers , we can rec@@ og@@ ni@@ ze that the human abil@@ ity to sur@@ vi@@ ve and fl@@ ou@@ ris@@ h is d@@ riv@@ en by the str@@ u@@ gg@@ le of the human spi@@ ri@@ t through con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t into trans@@ form@@ ation .
So , again , trans@@ form@@ ation , ad@@ ap@@ t@@ ation , is our gre@@ at@@ est human sk@@ ill .
And , per@@ hap@@ s , un@@ ti@@ l we &apos;re tes@@ ted , we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re made of .
M@@ ay@@ be that &apos;s what ad@@ ver@@ s@@ ity gi@@ ves us : a sense of self , a sense of our own power .
So , we can give our@@ selves a gi@@ ft .
We can re@@ -@@ imag@@ ine ad@@ ver@@ s@@ ity as something more than just t@@ ough times .
M@@ ay@@ be we can see it as change .
A@@ d@@ ver@@ s@@ ity is just change that we hav@@ en &apos;t ad@@ ap@@ ted our@@ selves to y@@ et .
I think the gre@@ at@@ est ad@@ ver@@ s@@ ity that we &apos;ve cre@@ ated for our@@ selves is this idea of nor@@ m@@ alc@@ y . Now , who &apos;s nor@@ m@@ al ?
There &apos;s no nor@@ m@@ al . There &apos;s comm@@ on , there &apos;s t@@ y@@ pic@@ al . There &apos;s no nor@@ m@@ al ,
and would you want to me@@ et that po@@ or , be@@ ig@@ e person if they ex@@ ist@@ ed ?
I don &apos;t think so .
If we can change this par@@ a@@ di@@ g@@ m from one of a@@ chi@@ ev@@ ing nor@@ m@@ alc@@ y to one of possi@@ bil@@ ity -- or pot@@ en@@ c@@ y , to be even a little bit more d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous -- we can rel@@ e@@ ase the power of so many more children , and inv@@ ite them to eng@@ age their r@@ are and val@@ u@@ able abil@@ ities with the commun@@ ity .
An@@ thr@@ op@@ olog@@ ist@@ s tell us that the one thing we as hum@@ ans have always re@@ qu@@ i@@ red of our commun@@ ity mem@@ b@@ ers is to be of use , to be able to con@@ tri@@ bu@@ te .
There &apos;s ev@@ id@@ ence that Ne@@ and@@ er@@ th@@ als , 6@@ 0@@ ,000 years ago , car@@ ri@@ ed their el@@ der@@ ly and those with ser@@ i@@ ous ph@@ y@@ s@@ ical in@@ j@@ ur@@ y , and per@@ hap@@ s it &apos;s because the life ex@@ peri@@ ence of sur@@ viv@@ al of these people prov@@ ed of val@@ ue to the commun@@ ity . They didn &apos;t vie@@ w these people as b@@ ro@@ k@@ en and us@@ el@@ ess ; they were se@@ en as r@@ are and val@@ u@@ able .
A few years ago , I was in a f@@ ood mark@@ et in the to@@ wn where I gre@@ w up in that red z@@ one in nor@@ the@@ ast@@ er@@ n Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ an@@ ia ,
and I was st@@ and@@ ing over a bus@@ h@@ el of t@@ om@@ at@@ o@@ es .
It was sum@@ mer@@ time : I had sh@@ or@@ ts on .
I he@@ ar this gu@@ y , his v@@ o@@ ice be@@ h@@ in@@ d me say , &quot; Well , if it is@@ n &apos;t A@@ im@@ ee M@@ ul@@ lin@@ s . &quot; And I tur@@ n around , and it &apos;s this ol@@ der man . I have no idea who he is .
And I said , &quot; I &apos;m sor@@ ry , si@@ r , have we m@@ et ? I don &apos;t re@@ mem@@ ber me@@ et@@ ing you . &quot; He said , &quot; Well , you w@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t re@@ mem@@ ber me@@ et@@ ing me .
I mean , when we m@@ et I was del@@ i@@ ver@@ ing you from your mo@@ ther &apos;s wom@@ b . &quot;
Oh , that gu@@ y .
And , but of course , actually , it did cl@@ ick .
This man was D@@ r@@ . K@@ e@@ an , a man that I had only kno@@ wn about through my mo@@ ther &apos;s stor@@ ies of that day , because , of course , t@@ y@@ pic@@ al f@@ as@@ hi@@ on , I arriv@@ ed l@@ ate for my bi@@ r@@ th@@ day by two we@@ e@@ ks .
And so my mo@@ ther &apos;s pren@@ at@@ al ph@@ y@@ s@@ ici@@ an had g@@ one on v@@ ac@@ ation , so the man who del@@ i@@ ver@@ ed me was a compl@@ ete str@@ ang@@ er to my par@@ ents .
And , because I was bor@@ n with@@ out the fi@@ bu@@ la b@@ ones , and had fe@@ et tur@@ ned in , and a few to@@ es in this f@@ oo@@ t and a few to@@ es in that , he had to be the be@@ ar@@ er -- this str@@ ang@@ er had to be the be@@ ar@@ er of b@@ ad ne@@ ws .
He said to me , &quot; I had to give this prog@@ n@@ os@@ is to your par@@ ents that you would never w@@ alk , and you would never have the kind of mo@@ bil@@ ity that other kids have or any kind of life of in@@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ence , and you &apos;ve been making li@@ ar out of me ever sin@@ ce . &quot; The ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary thing is that he said he had s@@ av@@ ed ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er cli@@ p@@ p@@ ings thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ out my whole chil@@ d@@ h@@ ood , wh@@ ether w@@ in@@ ning a secon@@ d gr@@ ade sp@@ el@@ ling be@@ e ,
mar@@ ch@@ ing with the G@@ ir@@ l S@@ cou@@ ts , you know , the H@@ al@@ lo@@ ween par@@ ade , w@@ in@@ ning my col@@ le@@ ge sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ shi@@ p , or any of my s@@ port@@ s vic@@ tor@@ ies , and he was using it , and in@@ te@@ gr@@ ating it into te@@ ach@@ ing res@@ id@@ ent stud@@ ents , m@@ ed stud@@ ents from H@@ a@@ h@@ n@@ em@@ an@@ n M@@ ed@@ ical S@@ ch@@ ool and H@@ er@@ sh@@ ey M@@ ed@@ ical S@@ ch@@ ool .
And he called this part of the course the X F@@ ac@@ t@@ or , the pot@@ enti@@ al of the human will .
No prog@@ n@@ os@@ is can acc@@ oun@@ t for how po@@ w@@ er@@ ful this could be as a de@@ ter@@ min@@ ant in the qual@@ ity of some@@ one &apos;s life .
And D@@ r@@ . K@@ e@@ an went on to tell me , he said , &quot; In my ex@@ peri@@ ence , un@@ less re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly t@@ old o@@ ther@@ wi@@ se , and even if gi@@ v@@ en a mo@@ dic@@ um of sup@@ por@@ t , if le@@ ft to their own de@@ vic@@ es , a chil@@ d will a@@ chi@@ eve . &quot;
S@@ ee , D@@ r@@ . K@@ e@@ an made that shi@@ ft in thinking .
He underst@@ ood that there &apos;s a differ@@ ence between the me@@ dic@@ al con@@ d@@ ition and what some@@ one might do with it .
And there &apos;s been a shi@@ ft in my thinking over time , in that , if you had as@@ ked me at 1@@ 5 years old , if I would have tra@@ ded pros@@ th@@ et@@ ics for fl@@ es@@ h@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ b@@ one leg@@ s , I w@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t have h@@ es@@ it@@ ated for a secon@@ d .
I as@@ pi@@ red to that kind of nor@@ m@@ alc@@ y back then .
But if you as@@ k me today , I &apos;m not so s@@ ure .
And it &apos;s because of the ex@@ peri@@ en@@ ces I &apos;ve had with them , not in sp@@ ite of the ex@@ peri@@ en@@ ces I &apos;ve had with them .
And per@@ hap@@ s this shi@@ ft in me has happen@@ ed because I &apos;ve been ex@@ pos@@ ed to more people who have op@@ en@@ ed do@@ ors for me than those who have put li@@ ds and cas@@ t sh@@ ad@@ o@@ ws on me .
S@@ ee , all you really need is one person to show you the e@@ pi@@ ph@@ any of your own power , and you &apos;re off . If you can h@@ and som@@ eb@@ o@@ dy the k@@ ey to their own power -- the human spi@@ ri@@ t is so rec@@ ep@@ tive -- if you can do that and op@@ en a do@@ or for some@@ one at a cr@@ u@@ ci@@ al mom@@ ent , you are educ@@ ating them in the b@@ est sense .
You &apos;re te@@ ach@@ ing them to op@@ en do@@ ors for th@@ em@@ selves .
In fact , the ex@@ act me@@ an@@ ing of the wor@@ d &quot; educ@@ ate &quot; comes from the ro@@ o@@ t wor@@ d &quot; ed@@ u@@ ce . &quot; It me@@ ans &quot; to br@@ ing for@@ th what is with@@ in , to br@@ ing out pot@@ enti@@ al . &quot;
So again , which pot@@ enti@@ al do we want to br@@ ing out ?
There was a cas@@ e stu@@ dy done in 19@@ 6@@ 0@@ s B@@ rit@@ ain , when they were mov@@ ing from gr@@ am@@ ma@@ r sch@@ o@@ ol@@ s to com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ve sch@@ o@@ ol@@ s .
It &apos;s called the str@@ e@@ am@@ ing tri@@ als . We call it &quot; tr@@ ac@@ king &quot; here in the St@@ ates .
It &apos;s se@@ par@@ ating stud@@ ents from A , B , C , D and so on .
And the &quot; A stud@@ ents &quot; get the t@@ ou@@ gh@@ er cur@@ ric@@ ul@@ um , the b@@ est te@@ ach@@ ers , et@@ c . Well , they took , over a th@@ re@@ e-@@ mon@@ th peri@@ od , D@@ -@@ lev@@ el stud@@ ents , g@@ ave them A &apos;s , t@@ old them they were &quot; A &apos;s , &quot; t@@ old them they were b@@ right ,
and at the end of this th@@ re@@ e-@@ mon@@ th peri@@ od , they were per@@ form@@ ing at A@@ -@@ lev@@ el . And , of course , the hear@@ t@@ bre@@ a@@ king , f@@ li@@ p side of this stu@@ dy , is that they took the &quot; A stud@@ ents &quot; and t@@ old them they were &quot; D &apos;s . &quot; And that &apos;s what happen@@ ed at the end of that th@@ re@@ e-@@ mon@@ th peri@@ od .
Th@@ ose who were still around in sch@@ ool , b@@ es@@ ide@@ s the people who had dr@@ op@@ p@@ ed out .
A cr@@ u@@ ci@@ al part of this cas@@ e stu@@ dy was that the te@@ ach@@ ers were du@@ p@@ ed too .
The te@@ ach@@ ers didn &apos;t know a s@@ w@@ it@@ ch had been made .
They were sim@@ p@@ ly t@@ old , &quot; Th@@ ese are the &apos; A@@ -@@ stud@@ ents , &apos; these are the &apos; D@@ -@@ stud@@ ents . &apos; &quot;
And that &apos;s how they went about te@@ ach@@ ing them and tre@@ ating them .
So , I think that the only tru@@ e dis@@ abil@@ ity is a cr@@ us@@ h@@ ed spi@@ ri@@ t , a spi@@ ri@@ t that &apos;s been cr@@ us@@ h@@ ed doesn &apos;t have h@@ ope ,
it doesn &apos;t see be@@ aut@@ y ,
it no l@@ ong@@ er has our natur@@ al , chil@@ d@@ like cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity and our inn@@ ate abil@@ ity to imag@@ ine .
If in@@ ste@@ ad , we can b@@ ol@@ st@@ er a human spi@@ ri@@ t to ke@@ ep h@@ ope , to see be@@ aut@@ y in th@@ em@@ selves and o@@ th@@ ers , to be cu@@ ri@@ ous and imag@@ in@@ ative , then we are tru@@ ly using our power well .
When a spi@@ ri@@ t has those qual@@ ities , we are able to create new real@@ ities and new ways of being .
I &apos;d like to le@@ ave you with a po@@ e@@ m by a f@@ our@@ te@@ en@@ th@@ -@@ cent@@ ur@@ y Per@@ si@@ an po@@ et n@@ am@@ ed H@@ a@@ fi@@ z that my fri@@ end , J@@ acqu@@ es D@@ em@@ bo@@ is t@@ old me about ,
and the po@@ e@@ m is called &quot; The G@@ od W@@ ho O@@ n@@ ly K@@ no@@ ws F@@ our W@@ or@@ ds &quot; : &quot; E@@ very chil@@ d has kno@@ wn G@@ od , not the G@@ od of n@@ am@@ es , not the G@@ od of don &apos;@@ ts , but the G@@ od who only kno@@ ws four wor@@ ds and ke@@ ep@@ s re@@ pe@@ ating them , s@@ aying , &apos; Come d@@ ance with me . Come , d@@ ance with me . Come , d@@ ance with me . &apos; &quot;
Thank you .
