L@@ ast year I showed these two sli@@ des so that de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate that the ar@@ c@@ tic ice ca@@ p , which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lo@@ wer 4@@ 8 st@@ ates , has sh@@ run@@ k by 40 percent .
But this underst@@ ates the seri@@ ous@@ ness of this particular problem because it doesn &apos;t show the th@@ ick@@ ness of the ice .
The ar@@ c@@ tic ice ca@@ p is , in a sense , the be@@ ating heart of the global climate system .
It exp@@ ands in win@@ ter and contr@@ ac@@ ts in sum@@ mer .
The next slide I show you will be a rap@@ id f@@ ast@@ -@@ forward of what &apos;s happened over the last 25 years .
The per@@ man@@ ent ice is mar@@ ked in red .
As you see , it exp@@ ands to the dark blue --
that &apos;s the an@@ nu@@ al ice in win@@ ter , and it contr@@ ac@@ ts in sum@@ mer .
The so@@ -@@ called per@@ man@@ ent ice , five years old or ol@@ der , you can see is almost like blood , spi@@ l@@ ling out of the body here .
In 25 years it &apos;s gone from this , to this .
This is a problem because the war@@ ming he@@ ats up the f@@ ro@@ z@@ en ground around the Ar@@ c@@ tic Oc@@ e@@ an , where there is a mas@@ sive amount of f@@ ro@@ z@@ en carbon which , when it th@@ a@@ ws , is turned into me@@ th@@ ane by micro@@ b@@ es .
Com@@ par@@ ed to the tot@@ al amount of global war@@ ming pol@@ lu@@ tion in the atmos@@ phere , that amount could d@@ ouble if we cr@@ oss this ti@@ p@@ ping point .
Al@@ ready in some sh@@ allow la@@ kes in A@@ las@@ k@@ a , me@@ th@@ ane is ac@@ ti@@ vely bu@@ b@@ bl@@ ing up out of the water .
Pro@@ f@@ ess@@ or K@@ at@@ ey Wal@@ ter from the Univers@@ ity of A@@ las@@ k@@ a went out with another team to another sh@@ allow la@@ ke last win@@ ter .
V@@ ide@@ o : Wh@@ o@@ a ! Al G@@ ore : She &apos;s o@@ kay . The question is whether we will be .
And one reason is , this enorm@@ ous he@@ at sin@@ k he@@ ats up Gre@@ en@@ land from the nor@@ th .
This is an an@@ nu@@ al m@@ el@@ ting riv@@ er .
But the vol@@ um@@ es are much larg@@ er than ever .
This is the K@@ ang@@ er@@ l@@ us@@ su@@ a@@ q R@@ iv@@ er in s@@ ou@@ th@@ w@@ est Gre@@ en@@ land .
If you want to know how sea level ris@@ es from land@@ -@@ base ice m@@ el@@ ting this is where it re@@ ach@@ es the sea .
These flo@@ ws are incre@@ as@@ ing very rapid@@ ly .
At the other end of the planet , An@@ tar@@ c@@ t@@ ica the larg@@ est mass of ice on the planet .
L@@ ast month scientists re@@ port@@ ed the entire contin@@ ent is now in neg@@ ative ice bal@@ ance . And w@@ est An@@ tar@@ c@@ t@@ ica cr@@ op@@ ped up on top some under@@ -@@ sea is@@ l@@ ands , is partic@@ ularly rap@@ id in its m@@ el@@ ting .
That &apos;s equ@@ al to 20 feet of sea level , as is Gre@@ en@@ land .
In the H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ as , the third larg@@ est mass of ice : at the top you see new la@@ kes , which a few years ago were gl@@ aci@@ ers .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their dr@@ in@@ king water from that m@@ el@@ ting f@@ low .
In the An@@ des , this gl@@ aci@@ er is the source of dr@@ in@@ king water for this city .
The flo@@ ws have incre@@ as@@ ed .
But when they go away , so does much of the dr@@ in@@ king water .
In California there has been a 40 percent de@@ cl@@ ine in the Si@@ erra s@@ no@@ w@@ p@@ ack .
This is h@@ itting the res@@ er@@ vo@@ ir@@ s .
And the predic@@ tions , as you &apos;ve read , are seri@@ ous .
This dr@@ ying around the world has lead to a d@@ ram@@ atic incre@@ ase in fi@@ res .
And the dis@@ ast@@ ers around the world have been incre@@ as@@ ing at an absolutely extra@@ ordinary and un@@ preced@@ ent@@ ed rate .
F@@ our times as many in the last 30 years as in the pre@@ vi@@ ous 7@@ 5 .
This is a completely un@@ sustain@@ able pattern .
If you look at in the cont@@ ext of history you can see what this is doing .
In the last five years we &apos;ve ad@@ ded 70 million t@@ ons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million t@@ ons every day to the oce@@ ans .
Look car@@ ef@@ ully at the area of the e@@ ast@@ er@@ n P@@ aci@@ fic , from the Americ@@ as , ex@@ ten@@ ding w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard , and on either side of the Indi@@ an sub@@ contin@@ ent , where there is a rad@@ ical de@@ pl@@ e@@ tion of ox@@ y@@ g@@ en in the oce@@ ans .
The bigg@@ est single cause of global war@@ ming , along with de@@ for@@ est@@ ation , which is 20 percent of it , is the bur@@ ning of fos@@ si@@ l fu@@ els .
O@@ il is a problem , and co@@ al is the most seri@@ ous problem .
The United States is one of the two larg@@ est em@@ it@@ ters , along with China .
And the propos@@ al has been to build a lot more co@@ al plants .
But we &apos;re beginning to see a sea change .
Here are the ones that have been can@@ cell@@ ed in the last few years with some green altern@@ ati@@ ves propos@@ ed .
H@@ ow@@ ever there is a political batt@@ le in our country .
And the co@@ al indus@@ tries and the oil indus@@ tries spent a quar@@ ter of a billion dollars in the last cal@@ end@@ ar year prom@@ ot@@ ing cle@@ an co@@ al , which is an ox@@ y@@ mor@@ on .
That image re@@ min@@ ded me of something .
Ar@@ ound Ch@@ rist@@ m@@ as , in my home in T@@ enn@@ es@@ see , a billion g@@ all@@ ons of co@@ al s@@ lu@@ dge was spi@@ l@@ led .
You probably saw it on the news .
This , all over the country , is the second larg@@ est w@@ aste stre@@ am in America .
This happened around Ch@@ rist@@ m@@ as .
One of the co@@ al industry &apos;s ad@@ s around Ch@@ rist@@ m@@ as was this one .
V@@ ide@@ o : ♪ ♫ F@@ ros@@ ty the co@@ al man is a j@@ ol@@ ly , happy s@@ ou@@ l .
He &apos;s ab@@ un@@ d@@ ant here in America , and he hel@@ ps our economy grow .
F@@ ros@@ ty the co@@ al man is getting cle@@ an@@ er every@@ day .
He &apos;s af@@ for@@ d@@ able and ad@@ or@@ able , and wor@@ kers keep their pay .
Al G@@ ore : This is the source of much of the co@@ al in W@@ est V@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ ia .
The larg@@ est moun@@ tain@@ top min@@ er is the head of M@@ as@@ se@@ y Co@@ al .
V@@ ide@@ o : Don B@@ lan@@ k@@ en@@ ship : Let me be clear about it . Al G@@ ore , N@@ anc@@ y P@@ el@@ osi , Har@@ ry Re@@ id , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al G@@ ore : So the Al@@ li@@ ance for C@@ lim@@ ate Pr@@ ot@@ ection has la@@ un@@ ched two cam@@ p@@ ai@@ gn@@ s .
This is one of them , part of one of them .
V@@ ide@@ o : Ac@@ tor : At CO@@ A@@ L@@ er@@ g@@ y we view climate change as a very seri@@ ous thre@@ at to our business .
That &apos;s why we &apos;ve made it our prim@@ ary goal to spend a large su@@ m of money on an ad@@ ver@@ tis@@ ing ef@@ for@@ t to help bring out and complic@@ ate the truth about co@@ al .
The fact is , co@@ al isn &apos;t dir@@ ty .
We think it &apos;s cle@@ an -- sm@@ el@@ ls good , too .
So don &apos;t wor@@ ry about climate change .
Le@@ ave that up to us .
V@@ ide@@ o : Ac@@ tor : C@@ le@@ an co@@ al -- you &apos;ve heard a lot about it .
So let &apos;s take a t@@ our of this stat@@ e-@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ art cle@@ an co@@ al facil@@ ity .
A@@ ma@@ zing ! The mach@@ in@@ ery is kind of l@@ ou@@ d . But that &apos;s the sound of cle@@ an co@@ al technology .
And while bur@@ ning co@@ al is one of the lead@@ ing ca@@ uses of global war@@ ming , the re@@ mark@@ able cle@@ an co@@ al technology you see here changes everything .
T@@ ake a good long look : this is today &apos;s cle@@ an co@@ al technology .
Al G@@ ore : Fin@@ ally , the positive altern@@ ative m@@ es@@ h@@ es with our economic challenge and our national sec@@ ur@@ ity challenge .
V@@ ide@@ o : N@@ arr@@ ator : America is in c@@ ris@@ is -- the economy , national sec@@ ur@@ ity , the climate c@@ ris@@ is .
The th@@ read that lin@@ ks them all : our ad@@ dic@@ tion to carbon based fu@@ els , like dir@@ ty co@@ al and for@@ e@@ ig@@ n oil .
But now there is a b@@ old new solution to get us out of this m@@ ess .
Re@@ power America with 100 percent cle@@ an electr@@ icity within 10 years .
A pl@@ an to put America back to work , make us more sec@@ ure , and help stop global war@@ ming .
Fin@@ ally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
Re@@ power America . F@@ ind out more .
Al G@@ ore : This is the last one .
V@@ ide@@ o : N@@ arr@@ ator : It &apos;s about re@@ power@@ ing America .
One of the f@@ ast@@ est ways to cut our de@@ pend@@ ence on old dir@@ ty fu@@ els that are kill@@ ing our planet .

N@@ arr@@ ator : Re@@ power America . It &apos;s time to get real .
Al G@@ ore : There is an old African pr@@ over@@ b that says , &quot; If you want to go quickly , go alone .
If you want to go far , go together . &quot;
We need to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
L@@ ast year at TED I gave an intro@@ duc@@ tion to the L@@ H@@ C .
And I prom@@ is@@ ed to come back and give you an up@@ date on how that machine worked .
So this is it . And for those of you that wer@@ en &apos;t there , the L@@ H@@ C is the larg@@ est scientific experiment ever att@@ em@@ p@@ ted -- 2@@ 7 kil@@ om@@ et@@ ers in cir@@ c@@ um@@ fer@@ ence .
I@@ ts job is to re@@ create the cond@@ itions that were present less than a bil@@ li@@ on@@ th of a second after the universe began , up to 6@@ 00 million times a second .
It &apos;s nothing if not amb@@ iti@@ ous .
This is the machine bel@@ ow G@@ en@@ eva .
We take the pictures of those min@@ i@@ -@@ Bi@@ g B@@ ang@@ s inside det@@ ec@@ tors .
This is the one I work on . It &apos;s called the A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S det@@ ec@@ tor -- 4@@ 4 met@@ ers wi@@ de , 2@@ 2 met@@ ers in di@@ am@@ eter .
Sp@@ ec@@ tac@@ ular picture here of A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S under construc@@ tion so you can see the scale .
On the 10@@ th of S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber last year we turned the machine on for the first time .
And this picture was taken by A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S .
It ca@@ used im@@ men@@ se celebr@@ ation in the control room .
It &apos;s a picture of the first be@@ am partic@@ le going all the way around the L@@ H@@ C , col@@ li@@ ding with a piece of the L@@ H@@ C del@@ i@@ ber@@ ately , and sho@@ wer@@ ing partic@@ les into the det@@ ec@@ tor .
In other words , when we saw that picture on S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber 10@@ th we knew the machine worked , which is a great tri@@ um@@ p@@ h .
I don &apos;t know whether this got the bigg@@ est che@@ er , or this , when someone went onto Google and saw the front p@@ age was like that .
It means we made cultur@@ al impact as well as scientific impact .
Ab@@ out a week later we had a problem with the machine , rel@@ ated actually to these b@@ its of w@@ ire here -- these g@@ old wi@@ res .
Th@@ ose wi@@ res car@@ ry 1@@ 3 thous@@ and am@@ ps when the machine is working in full power .
Now the engine@@ ers am@@ ong@@ st you will look at them and say , &quot; No they don &apos;t . They &apos;re small wi@@ res . &quot;
They can do that because when they are very col@@ d they are what &apos;s called super@@ cond@@ uc@@ ting w@@ ire .
So at min@@ us 2@@ 7@@ 1 degre@@ es , col@@ der than the space between the stars , those wi@@ res can take that curr@@ ent .
In one of the jo@@ in@@ ts between over 9@@ ,000 mag@@ n@@ ets in L@@ H@@ C , there was a manu@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing de@@ f@@ ect .
So the w@@ ire he@@ ated up sli@@ gh@@ tly , and its 1@@ 3@@ ,000 am@@ ps sud@@ den@@ ly en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ed electr@@ ical resist@@ ance .
This was the result .
Now that &apos;s more im@@ pres@@ sive when you consi@@ der those mag@@ n@@ ets we@@ igh over 20 t@@ ons , and they moved about a f@@ oot .
So we d@@ am@@ aged about 50 of the mag@@ n@@ ets .
We had to take them out , which we did .
We re@@ cond@@ iti@@ on@@ ed them all , fi@@ x@@ ed them .
They &apos;re all on their way back under@@ ground now .
By the end of Mar@@ ch the L@@ H@@ C will be int@@ act again .
We will sw@@ it@@ ch it on , and we exp@@ ect to take data in J@@ une or Ju@@ ly , and continu@@ e with our ques@@ t to find out what the building b@@ loc@@ ks of the universe are .
Now of course , in a way those acci@@ d@@ ents re@@ ig@@ n@@ ite the deb@@ ate about the value of science and engine@@ ering at the ed@@ ge . It &apos;s easy to re@@ fu@@ te .
I think that the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact that we &apos;re over@@ re@@ ach@@ ing , is the value of things like the L@@ H@@ C .
I will leave the fin@@ al word to an English scienti@@ st , H@@ um@@ ph@@ re@@ y Dav@@ y , who , I sus@@ p@@ ect , when de@@ f@@ end@@ ing his prote@@ ge &apos;s us@@ eless experim@@ ents -- his prote@@ ge was Mi@@ cha@@ el F@@ ar@@ ad@@ ay -- said this , &quot; No@@ thing is so dang@@ er@@ ous to the progres@@ s of the human mind than to as@@ su@@ me that our vie@@ ws of science are ul@@ tim@@ ate , that there are no my@@ ster@@ ies in nature , that our tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s are compl@@ ete , and that there are no new worl@@ ds to con@@ qu@@ er . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid , playing with b@@ loc@@ ks .
As you fi@@ gu@@ red out how to re@@ ach out and gr@@ as@@ p , pic@@ k them up and move them around , you were actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and mani@@ pul@@ ating sp@@ ati@@ al relation@@ shi@@ ps .
S@@ pati@@ al reas@@ on@@ ing is de@@ ep@@ ly connec@@ ted to how we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , as a computer scienti@@ st inspi@@ red by this uti@@ l@@ ity of our inter@@ ac@@ tions with physical objects -- along with my ad@@ vis@@ er P@@ atti@@ e , and my collabor@@ ator J@@ e@@ ev@@ an K@@ al@@ an@@ i@@ th@@ i -- I started to won@@ der -- what if when we used a computer , instead of having this one m@@ ouse cur@@ s@@ or that was a like a dig@@ ital fing@@ er@@ ti@@ p moving around a fl@@ at des@@ k@@ top , what if we could re@@ ach in with both hands and gr@@ as@@ p information physic@@ ally ,
ar@@ ran@@ ging it the way we wanted ?
This question was so comp@@ el@@ ling that we decided to expl@@ ore the answer , by building Si@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ les .
In a n@@ ut@@ sh@@ ell , a Si@@ f@@ table is an inter@@ active computer
the size of a coo@@ k@@ ie .
They &apos;re able to be moved around by hand , they can sense each other , they can sense their moti@@ on , and they have a scre@@ en and a w@@ ir@@ eless radio .
M@@ ost import@@ antly , they &apos;re physical , so like the b@@ loc@@ ks , you can move them just by re@@ ach@@ ing out and gr@@ asp@@ ing .
And Si@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ les are an example of a new ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem of tools for mani@@ pul@@ ating dig@@ ital information .
And as these tools become more physical , more aw@@ are of their moti@@ on , aw@@ are of each other , and aw@@ are of the nu@@ ance of how we move them , we can start to expl@@ ore some new and fun inter@@ action st@@ y@@ les .
So , I &apos;m going to start with some simple examples .
This Si@@ f@@ table is con@@ fi@@ gu@@ red to show video , and if I til@@ t it in one direc@@ tion , it &apos;ll r@@ ol@@ l the video this way ; if I til@@ t it the other way it r@@ ol@@ ls it back@@ wards .
And these inter@@ active por@@ tra@@ its are aw@@ are of each other .
So if I put them next to each other , they get interested .
If they get sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded , they not@@ ice that too ,
they might get a little flu@@ ster@@ ed .
And they can also sense their moti@@ on and til@@ t .
One of the interesting im@@ plic@@ ations on inter@@ action , we started to realize , was that we could use every@@ day g@@ es@@ tures on data , like p@@ our@@ ing a color the way we might p@@ our a li@@ qu@@ id .
So in this case , we &apos;ve got three Si@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ les con@@ fi@@ gu@@ red to be pa@@ int buc@@ k@@ ets and I can use them to p@@ our color into that centr@@ al one ,
where they get mi@@ x@@ ed .
If we over@@ sh@@ oot , we can p@@ our a little bit back .
There are also some ne@@ at possi@@ bil@@ ities for education , like language , mat@@ h and log@@ ic g@@ ames where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly , and view the res@@ ul@@ ts immedi@@ ately .
So here I &apos;m --
This is a Fi@@ b@@ on@@ ac@@ ci sequ@@ ence that I &apos;m making with a simple equ@@ ation program .
Here we have a word game that &apos;s kind of like a mas@@ h@@ -@@ up between S@@ cr@@ ab@@ ble and B@@ ogg@@ le .
B@@ as@@ ically , in every r@@ ound you get a r@@ and@@ om@@ ly as@@ sign@@ ed l@@ etter on each Si@@ f@@ table , and as you try to make words it ch@@ ec@@ ks against a dic@@ tion@@ ary .
Then , after about 30 secon@@ ds , it res@@ hu@@ ff@@ les , and you have a new set of let@@ ters and new possi@@ bil@@ ities to try .
Thank you .
So these are some kids that came on a field tri@@ p to the Me@@ dia La@@ b , and I man@@ aged to get them to try it out , and sh@@ oot a video .
They really lov@@ ed it .
And , one of the interesting things about this kind of applic@@ ation is that you don &apos;t have to give people many in@@ struc@@ tions .
All you have to say is , &quot; Ma@@ ke words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
So here &apos;s another few people trying it out .
That &apos;s our youn@@ g@@ est bet@@ a t@@ est@@ er , down there on the right .
Tur@@ ns out , all he wanted to do was to st@@ ack the Si@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ les up .
So to him , they were just b@@ loc@@ ks .
Now , this is an inter@@ active car@@ to@@ on applic@@ ation .
And we wanted to build a learning t@@ ool for language lear@@ ners . And this is F@@ el@@ i@@ x , actually .
And he can bring new charac@@ ters into the sc@@ ene ,
just by li@@ f@@ ting the Si@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ les off the table that have that charac@@ ter sho@@ wn on them .
Here , he &apos;s br@@ ing@@ ing the s@@ un out .
V@@ ide@@ o : The s@@ un is ris@@ ing .
David M@@ er@@ ri@@ ll : Now he &apos;s brought a trac@@ tor into the sc@@ ene .
V@@ ide@@ o : The or@@ an@@ ge trac@@ tor .
G@@ ood job ! Yeah !
D@@ M : So by sh@@ a@@ king the Si@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ les and putting them next to each other he can make the charac@@ ters inter@@ act --
V@@ ide@@ o : W@@ o@@ of !
D@@ M : invent@@ ing his own n@@ arr@@ ative .
V@@ ide@@ o : H@@ ello !
D@@ M : It &apos;s an open@@ -@@ en@@ ded story ,
and he gets to deci@@ de how it un@@ fol@@ ds .
V@@ ide@@ o : F@@ ly away , c@@ at .
D@@ M : So , the last example I have time to show you today is a music sequ@@ enc@@ ing and live performan@@ ce t@@ ool
that we &apos;ve built recently ,
in which Si@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ les act as s@@ ounds like lead , bas@@ s and dr@@ um@@ s .
E@@ ach of these has four different vari@@ ations , you get to cho@@ ose which one you want to use .
And you can in@@ ject these s@@ ounds into a sequ@@ ence that you can as@@ sem@@ ble into the pattern that you want .
And you in@@ ject it by just b@@ um@@ ping up the sound Si@@ f@@ table against a sequ@@ ence Si@@ f@@ table .
There are eff@@ ects that you can control live , like re@@ ver@@ b and fil@@ ter .
You att@@ ach it to a particular sound and then til@@ t to ad@@ just it .
And then , over@@ all eff@@ ects like tempo and vol@@ ume that app@@ ly to the entire sequ@@ ence .
So let &apos;s have a look .
V@@ ide@@ o : D@@ M : We &apos;ll start by putting a lead into two sequ@@ ence Si@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ les , ar@@ ran@@ ge them into a series , ex@@ tend it , add a little more lead .
Now I put a bas@@ s line in .
V@@ ide@@ o : D@@ M : Now I &apos;ll put some perc@@ us@@ sion in .
V@@ ide@@ o : D@@ M : And now I &apos;ll att@@ ach the fil@@ ter to the dr@@ um@@ s , so I can control the effect live .
V@@ ide@@ o : D@@ M : I can speed up the whole sequ@@ ence by til@@ ting the tempo one way or the other .
V@@ ide@@ o : D@@ M : And now I &apos;ll att@@ ach the fil@@ ter to the bas@@ s for some more ex@@ pres@@ sion .
V@@ ide@@ o : D@@ M : I can re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ge the sequ@@ ence while it pl@@ ays .
So I don &apos;t have to pl@@ an it out in adv@@ ance , but I can improv@@ ise , making it longer or shor@@ ter as I go .
And now , finally , I can f@@ ade the whole sequ@@ ence out using the vol@@ ume Si@@ f@@ table , til@@ ted to the left .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my pas@@ sion is for making new human@@ -@@ computer inter@@ fac@@ es that are a better mat@@ ch to the ways our br@@ ains and bo@@ dies work .
And today , I had time to show you one point in this new design space , and a few of the possi@@ bil@@ ities that we &apos;re working to bring out of the laborat@@ ory .
So the thought I want to leave you with is that we &apos;re on the c@@ us@@ p of this new generation of tools for inter@@ ac@@ ting with dig@@ ital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms .
Thank you very much .
I look forward to talking with all of you .
I am a writ@@ er .
W@@ rit@@ ing books is my prof@@ es@@ sion but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It is also my great li@@ fel@@ ong love and fas@@ cin@@ ation .
And I don &apos;t exp@@ ect that that &apos;s ever going to change .
But , that said , something kind of p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar has happened recently in my life and in my car@@ e@@ er , which has ca@@ used me to have to rec@@ ali@@ br@@ ate my whole relationship with this work .
And the p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar thing is that I recently wrote this book , this mem@@ o@@ ir called &quot; E@@ at , Pr@@ ay , L@@ ove &quot; which , deci@@ de@@ d@@ ly un@@ like any of my pre@@ vi@@ ous books , went out in the world for some reason , and became this big , me@@ g@@ a-@@ sens@@ ation , intern@@ ational b@@ est@@ sel@@ ler thing .
The result of which is that every@@ where I go now , people tre@@ at me like I &apos;m do@@ om@@ ed .
S@@ eri@@ ously -- do@@ om@@ ed , do@@ om@@ ed !
Li@@ ke , they come up to me now , all wor@@ ried , and they say , &quot; A@@ re@@ n &apos;t you afr@@ aid you &apos;re never going to be able to top that ?
A@@ re@@ n &apos;t you afr@@ aid you &apos;re going to keep writ@@ ing for your whole life and you &apos;re never again going to create a book that anybody in the world car@@ es about at all ,
ever again ? &quot;
So that &apos;s re@@ ass@@ ur@@ ing , you know .
But it would be wor@@ se , exc@@ ept for that I happen to remember that over 20 years ago , when I was a te@@ en@@ ag@@ er , when I first started telling people that I wanted to be a writ@@ er ,
I was met with this same sort of f@@ ear@@ -@@ based re@@ action .
And people would say , &quot; A@@ re@@ n &apos;t you afr@@ aid you &apos;re never going to have any succ@@ ess ?
A@@ re@@ n &apos;t you afr@@ aid the hu@@ mili@@ ation of re@@ j@@ ection will k@@ ill you ?
A@@ re@@ n &apos;t you afr@@ aid that you &apos;re going to work your whole life at this cra@@ ft and nothing &apos;s ever going to come of it and you &apos;re going to die on a sc@@ ra@@ p he@@ a@@ p of bro@@ ken dre@@ ams with your m@@ outh f@@ ill@@ ed with b@@ itt@@ er as@@ h of fail@@ ure ? &quot;
Li@@ ke that , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all those questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I &apos;m afr@@ aid of all those things .
And I always have been .
And I &apos;m afr@@ aid of many , many more things b@@ es@@ ide@@ s that people can &apos;t even guess at ,
like se@@ a@@ we@@ ed and other things that are sc@@ ary .
But , when it comes to writ@@ ing , the thing that I &apos;ve been sort of thinking about l@@ ately , and wonder@@ ing about l@@ ately , is why ?
You know , is it r@@ ational ?
Is it log@@ ical that anybody should be exp@@ ected to be afr@@ aid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do .
And what is it speci@@ fic@@ ally about creative vent@@ u@@ res that seems to make us really ner@@ v@@ ous about each other &apos;s mental health in a way that other car@@ e@@ ers kind of don &apos;t do , you know ?
Li@@ ke my d@@ ad , for example , was a chem@@ ical engine@@ er and I don &apos;t rec@@ all once in his 40 years of chem@@ ical engine@@ ering anybody asking him if he was afr@@ aid to be a chem@@ ical engine@@ er , you know ?
&quot; That chem@@ ic@@ al@@ -@@ engine@@ ering b@@ lock , John , how &apos;s it going ? &quot;
It just didn &apos;t come up like that , you know ?
But to be f@@ air , chem@@ ical engine@@ ers as a group haven &apos;t really ear@@ ned a re@@ p@@ ut@@ ation over the cent@@ u@@ ri@@ es for being al@@ co@@ hol@@ ic man@@ ic@@ -@@ de@@ pres@@ si@@ ves .
We writ@@ ers , we kind of do have that re@@ p@@ ut@@ ation , and not just writ@@ ers , but creative people across all gen@@ res , it seems , have this re@@ p@@ ut@@ ation for being enorm@@ ously ment@@ ally un@@ st@@ able .
And all you have to do is look at the very gri@@ m death coun@@ t in the 20@@ th century alone , of really mag@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent creative min@@ ds who died young and often at their own hands , you know ?
And even the ones who didn &apos;t literally comm@@ it su@@ ici@@ de seem to be really un@@ done by their gi@@ f@@ ts , you know .
Nor@@ man Ma@@ il@@ er , just before he died , last inter@@ view , he said , &quot; E@@ very one of my books has kill@@ ed me a little more . &quot; A@@ n extra@@ ordinary stat@@ ement to make about your life &apos;s work .
But we don &apos;t even bl@@ ink when we hear somebody say this , because we &apos;ve heard that kind of stuff for so long and some@@ how we &apos;ve completely intern@@ ali@@ zed and acc@@ ep@@ ted coll@@ ec@@ ti@@ vely this not@@ ion that creati@@ vity and suff@@ ering are some@@ how in@@ her@@ ently lin@@ ked and that arti@@ str@@ y , in the end , will always ulti@@ mat@@ ely lead to an@@ gu@@ ish .
And the question that I want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea ?
A@@ re you com@@ fort@@ able with that ? Because you look at it even from an in@@ ch away and , you know -- I &apos;m not at all com@@ fort@@ able with that assum@@ p@@ tion .
I think it &apos;s o@@ di@@ ous .
And I also think it &apos;s dang@@ er@@ ous , and I don &apos;t want to see it per@@ pet@@ u@@ ated into the next century .
I think it &apos;s better if we en@@ cour@@ age our great creative min@@ ds to live .
And I defin@@ it@@ ely know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dang@@ er@@ ous for me to start sort of le@@ a@@ king down that dark p@@ ath of assum@@ p@@ tion , partic@@ ularly given the cir@@ c@@ um@@ st@@ ance that I &apos;m in right now in my car@@ e@@ er .
Wh@@ ich is -- you know , like ch@@ ec@@ k it out , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m only about 40 years old .
I still have maybe another four de@@ ca@@ des of work left in me .
And it &apos;s exc@@ e@@ ed@@ ingly likely that anything I write from this point forward is going to be ju@@ d@@ g@@ ed by the world as the work that came after the fre@@ ak@@ ish succ@@ ess of my last book , right ?
I should just put it bl@@ un@@ tly , because we &apos;re all sort of friends here now -- it &apos;s exc@@ e@@ ed@@ ingly likely that my gre@@ at@@ est succ@@ ess is behind me .
So J@@ es@@ us , what a thought !
That &apos;s the kind of thought that could lead a person to start dr@@ in@@ king g@@ in at n@@ ine o &apos;@@ c@@ lock in the morning , and I don &apos;t want to go there .
I would pre@@ f@@ er to keep doing this work that I love .
And so , the question becomes , how ?
And so , it seems to me , up@@ on a lot of re@@ fl@@ ection , that the way that I have to work now , in order to continu@@ e writ@@ ing , is that I have to create some sort of prot@@ ective psych@@ olog@@ ical construc@@ t , right ?
I have to sort of find some way to have a sa@@ fe dist@@ ance between me , as I am writ@@ ing , and my very natural an@@ x@@ i@@ ety about what the re@@ action to that writ@@ ing is going to be , from now on . And , as I &apos;ve been looking , over the last year , for model@@ s for how to do that , I &apos;ve been sort of looking across time , and I &apos;ve been trying to find other soci@@ eti@@ es to see if they might have had better and san@@ er ideas than we have
about how to help creative people sort of man@@ age the in@@ her@@ ent emoti@@ onal ris@@ ks of creati@@ vity .
And that se@@ ar@@ ch has led me to anci@@ ent Gre@@ ece and anci@@ ent R@@ ome .
So st@@ ay with me , because it does cir@@ cle around and back .
But , anci@@ ent Gre@@ ece and anci@@ ent R@@ ome -- people did not happen to believe that creati@@ vity came from human be@@ ings back then , OK ?
People believ@@ ed that creati@@ vity was this di@@ v@@ ine atten@@ d@@ ant spiri@@ t that came to human be@@ ings from some dist@@ ant and un@@ know@@ able source , for dist@@ ant and un@@ know@@ able reasons .
The Gre@@ e@@ ks fam@@ ously called these di@@ v@@ ine atten@@ d@@ ant spi@@ rit@@ s of creati@@ vity &quot; d@@ a@@ em@@ ons . &quot;
S@@ oc@@ r@@ ates , fam@@ ously , believ@@ ed that he had a d@@ a@@ em@@ on who spo@@ ke w@@ is@@ dom to him from af@@ ar .
The R@@ om@@ ans had the same idea , but they called that sort of di@@ sem@@ bo@@ died creative spiri@@ t a gen@@ i@@ us .
Wh@@ ich is great , because the R@@ om@@ ans did not actually think that a gen@@ i@@ us was a partic@@ ularly cl@@ ever individual .
They believ@@ ed that a gen@@ i@@ us was this , sort of mag@@ ical di@@ v@@ ine ent@@ ity , who was believ@@ ed to literally live in the w@@ alls of an arti@@ st &apos;s studio , kind of like Dob@@ by the house el@@ f , and who would come out and sort of invisi@@ bly assi@@ st the arti@@ st with their work and would shape the out@@ come of that work .
So bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant -- there it is , right there , that dist@@ ance that I &apos;m talking about -- that psych@@ olog@@ ical construc@@ t to prot@@ ect you from the res@@ ul@@ ts of your work .
And everyone knew that this is how it func@@ tion@@ ed , right ?
So the anci@@ ent arti@@ st was prot@@ ected from certain things , like , for example , too much n@@ ar@@ ci@@ s@@ si@@ s@@ m , right ?
If your work was bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant , you couldn &apos;t take all the cre@@ di@@ t for it , everybody knew that you had this di@@ sem@@ bo@@ died gen@@ i@@ us who had hel@@ ped you .
If your work bom@@ bed , not enti@@ rel@@ y your fa@@ ult , you know ?
Every@@ one knew your gen@@ i@@ us was kind of l@@ ame .
And this is how people thought about creati@@ vity in the W@@ est for a really long time .
And then the R@@ en@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance came and everything changed , and we had this big idea , and the big idea was , let &apos;s put the individual human being at the center of the universe ab@@ ove all go@@ ds and my@@ ster@@ ies , and there &apos;s no more room for my@@ st@@ ical cre@@ atures who take dic@@ t@@ ation from the di@@ v@@ ine .
And it &apos;s the beginning of r@@ ational human@@ ism , and people started to believe that creati@@ vity came completely from the self of the individual .
And for the first time in history , you start to hear people re@@ fer@@ r@@ ing to this or that arti@@ st as being a gen@@ i@@ us , rather than having a gen@@ i@@ us .
And I got to tell you , I think that was a huge err@@ or .
You know , I think that al@@ lowing somebody , one m@@ ere person to believe that he or she is like , the v@@ es@@ se@@ l , you know , like the fon@@ t and the ess@@ ence and the source of all di@@ v@@ ine , creative , un@@ know@@ able , et@@ er@@ n@@ al my@@ st@@ ery is just a s@@ mi@@ dge too much responsi@@ bility to put on one fr@@ ag@@ ile , human psy@@ che .
It &apos;s like asking somebody to s@@ wal@@ low the s@@ un .
It just completely war@@ ps and di@@ stor@@ ts e@@ go@@ s , and it cre@@ ates all these un@@ man@@ ag@@ e@@ able exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations about performan@@ ce .
And I think the press@@ ure of that has been kill@@ ing off our arti@@ sts for the last 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it is true , the question becomes , what now ?
Can we do this differ@@ ently ?
May@@ be go back to some more anci@@ ent understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative my@@ st@@ ery .
May@@ be not .
May@@ be we can &apos;t just er@@ ase 500 years of r@@ ational human@@ ist@@ ic thought in one 18 minute spe@@ ec@@ h .
And there &apos;s probably people in this audience who would rai@@ se really leg@@ it@@ im@@ ate scientific sus@@ pic@@ i@@ ons about the not@@ ion of , basically , f@@ ai@@ ri@@ es who fol@@ low people around ru@@ b@@ b@@ ing f@@ ai@@ ry ju@@ ice on their projects and stuff .
I &apos;m not , probably , going to bring you all along with me on this .
But the question that I kind of want to pose is -- you know , why not ?
Why not think about it this way ?
Because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of expl@@ ain@@ ing the ut@@ ter m@@ ad@@ den@@ ing cap@@ ric@@ i@@ ous@@ ness of the creative process .
A process which , as anybody who has ever tried to make something -- which is to say basically everyone here -@@ -- knows does not always be@@ have r@@ ati@@ on@@ ally .
And , in fact , can sometimes feel do@@ w@@ n@@ right par@@ an@@ or@@ m@@ al .
I had this en@@ coun@@ ter recently where I met the extra@@ ordinary American po@@ et R@@ ut@@ h St@@ one , who &apos;s now in her 9@@ 0s , but she &apos;s been a po@@ et her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rur@@ al V@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ ia , she would be out working in the fiel@@ ds , and she said she would feel and hear a po@@ e@@ m coming at her from over the land@@ sc@@ ape .
And she said it was like a th@@ under@@ ous tr@@ ain of air .
And it would come bar@@ rel@@ ing down at her over the land@@ sc@@ ape .
And she felt it coming , because it would sh@@ ake the ear@@ th under her feet .
She knew that she had only one thing to do at that point , and that was to , in her words , &quot; run like h@@ ell . &quot;
And she would run like h@@ ell to the house and she would be getting ch@@ as@@ ed by this po@@ e@@ m , and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pen@@ ci@@ l fast enough so that when it th@@ under@@ ed through her , she could coll@@ ect it and gra@@ b it on the p@@ age .
And other times she wouldn &apos;t be fast enough , so she &apos;d be running and running , and she wouldn &apos;t get to the house and the po@@ e@@ m would bar@@ re@@ l through her and she would mis@@ s it and she said it would continu@@ e on across the land@@ sc@@ ape , looking , as she put it &quot; for another po@@ et . &quot;
And then there were these times -- this is the piece I never for@@ got -- she said that there were mom@@ ents where she would almost mis@@ s it , right ?
So , she &apos;s running to the house and she &apos;s looking for the paper and the po@@ e@@ m pass@@ es through her , and she gr@@ ab@@ s a pen@@ ci@@ l just as it &apos;s going through her , and then she said , it was like she would re@@ ach out with her other hand and she would cat@@ ch it .
She would cat@@ ch the po@@ e@@ m by its tail , and she would pul@@ l it back@@ wards into her body as she was tran@@ scri@@ b@@ ing on the p@@ age .
And in these inst@@ ances , the po@@ e@@ m would come up on the p@@ age perfect and int@@ act but back@@ wards , from the last word to the first .
So when I heard that I was like -- that &apos;s un@@ can@@ ny , that &apos;s exactly what my creative process is like .
That &apos;s not at all what my creative process is -- I &apos;m not the pi@@ p@@ el@@ ine !
I &apos;m a mu@@ le , and the way that I have to work is I have to get up at the same time every day , and s@@ we@@ at and lab@@ or and bar@@ re@@ l through it really aw@@ k@@ war@@ d@@ ly .
But even I , in my mu@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , even I have br@@ ush@@ ed up against that thing , at times .
And I would imagine that a lot of you have too .
You know , even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I hon@@ est@@ ly cannot identi@@ fy .
And what is that thing ?
And how are we to rel@@ ate to it in a way that will not make us lose our min@@ ds , but , in fact , might actually keep us s@@ ane ?
And for me , the best contem@@ por@@ ary example that I have of how to do that is the mus@@ ici@@ an T@@ om W@@ a@@ its , who I got to inter@@ view several years ago on a mag@@ az@@ ine as@@ sign@@ ment .
And we were talking about this , and you know , T@@ om , for most of his life , he was pretty much the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of the tor@@ ment@@ ed contem@@ por@@ ary moder@@ n arti@@ st , trying to control and man@@ age and domin@@ ate these sort of un@@ controll@@ able creative imp@@ ul@@ ses that were totally intern@@ ali@@ zed .
But then he got ol@@ der , he got cal@@ mer , and one day he was driv@@ ing down the fre@@ e@@ way in L@@ os An@@ gel@@ es , and this is when it all changed for him .
And he &apos;s spe@@ ed@@ ing along , and all of a sud@@ den he hear@@ s this little fr@@ ag@@ ment of m@@ el@@ o@@ dy , that comes into his head as inspi@@ r@@ ation often comes , el@@ u@@ sive and t@@ ant@@ ali@@ zing , and he wants it , it &apos;s g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous , and he long@@ s for it , but he has no way to get it .
He doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , or a pen@@ ci@@ l , or a t@@ ape recor@@ der .
So he star@@ ts to feel all of that old an@@ x@@ i@@ ety start to ri@@ se in him like , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose this thing , and I &apos;ll be be h@@ a@@ un@@ ted by this song for@@ ever .
I &apos;m not good enough , and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of pan@@ ic@@ king , he just st@@ op@@ ped .
He just st@@ op@@ ped that whole mental process and he did something completely nov@@ el .
He just looked up at the sk@@ y , and he said , &quot; Ex@@ c@@ use me , can you not see that I &apos;m driv@@ ing ? &quot;
&quot; Do I look like I can write down a song right now ?
If you really want to ex@@ ist , come back at a more opportun@@ e moment when I can take care of you .
O@@ ther@@ wi@@ se , go b@@ other somebody else today .
G@@ o b@@ other Le@@ on@@ ard Co@@ h@@ en . &quot;
And his whole work process changed after that .
Not the work , the work was still of@@ ten@@ times as dark as ever .
But the process , and the he@@ av@@ y an@@ x@@ i@@ ety around it was rel@@ eas@@ ed when he took the gen@@ ie , the gen@@ i@@ us out of him where it was ca@@ using nothing but tr@@ ouble , and rel@@ eas@@ ed it back where it came from , and realized that this didn &apos;t have to be this intern@@ ali@@ zed , tor@@ ment@@ ed thing .
It could be this p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar , won@@ dr@@ ous , bi@@ z@@ arre collabor@@ ation , kind of convers@@ ation between T@@ om and the stran@@ ge , ex@@ ter@@ n@@ al thing that was not quite T@@ om .
When I heard that story , it started to shi@@ ft a little bit the way that I worked too , and this idea already sav@@ ed me once .
It sav@@ ed me when I was in the middle of writ@@ ing &quot; E@@ at , Pr@@ ay , L@@ ove , &quot; and I f@@ ell into one of those sort of p@@ its of des@@ p@@ air that we all fall into when we &apos;re working on something and it &apos;s not coming and you start to think this is going to be a dis@@ aster , the wor@@ st book ever wr@@ itt@@ en .
Not just bad , but the wor@@ st book ever wr@@ itt@@ en .
And I started to think I should just d@@ ump this project .
But then I remem@@ ber@@ ed T@@ om talking to the open air and I tried it .
So I just li@@ f@@ ted my face up from the man@@ us@@ cri@@ pt and I direc@@ ted my comm@@ ents to an em@@ p@@ ty cor@@ ner of the room .
And I said al@@ ou@@ d , &quot; L@@ ist@@ en you , thing , you and I both know that if this book isn &apos;t bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant that is not enti@@ rel@@ y my fa@@ ult , right ?
Because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this , I don &apos;t have any more than this .
If you want it to be better , you &apos;ve got to show up and do your part of the deal .
But if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , the h@@ ell with it .
I &apos;m going to keep writ@@ ing any@@ way because that &apos;s my job .
And I would pl@@ ease like the record to re@@ fl@@ ect today that I showed up for my part of the job . &quot; Because -- Because in the end it &apos;s like this , OK -- cent@@ u@@ ri@@ es ago in the des@@ er@@ ts of Nor@@ th Africa , people used to ga@@ ther for these mo@@ on@@ light d@@ ances of sac@@ red d@@ ance and music that would go on for hours and hours , until d@@ a@@ wn .
They were always mag@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent , because the d@@ an@@ cer@@ s were professi@@ on@@ als and they were terri@@ fic , right ?
But every once in a while , very r@@ ar@@ ely , something would happen , and one of these per@@ form@@ ers would actually become tran@@ sc@@ end@@ ent .
And I know you know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you &apos;ve all seen , at some point in your life , a performan@@ ce like this .
It was like time would stop , and the d@@ anc@@ er would sort of step through some kind of port@@ al and he wasn &apos;t doing anything different than he had ever done , 1@@ ,000 ni@@ ghts before , but everything would al@@ ig@@ n .
And all of a sud@@ den , he would no longer appe@@ ar to be mer@@ ely human .
He would be li@@ t from within , and li@@ t from bel@@ ow and all li@@ t up on fi@@ re with di@@ v@@ in@@ ity .
And when this happened , back then , people knew it for what it was , you know , they called it by its name .
They would put their hands together and they would start to ch@@ ant , &quot; Al@@ la@@ h , Al@@ la@@ h , Al@@ la@@ h , God , God , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
C@@ u@@ ri@@ ous hist@@ or@@ ical fo@@ ot@@ not@@ e : when the Mo@@ ors inv@@ a@@ ded s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n Sp@@ ain , they took this cu@@ st@@ om with them and the pron@@ un@@ ci@@ ation changed over the cent@@ u@@ ri@@ es from &quot; Al@@ la@@ h , Al@@ la@@ h , Al@@ la@@ h , &quot; to &quot; O@@ l@@ é , ol@@ é , ol@@ é , &quot; which you still hear in b@@ ul@@ l@@ fi@@ ghts and in fl@@ am@@ en@@ co d@@ ances .
In Sp@@ ain , when a per@@ form@@ er has done something im@@ possible and mag@@ ic , &quot; Al@@ la@@ h , ol@@ é , ol@@ é , Al@@ la@@ h , mag@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent , br@@ avo , &quot; in@@ com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ble , there it is -- a gli@@ m@@ p@@ se of God .
Wh@@ ich is great , because we need that .
But , the tr@@ ick@@ y bit comes the next morning , for the d@@ anc@@ er h@@ im@@ self , when he wa@@ kes up and disc@@ ov@@ ers that it &apos;s T@@ u@@ es@@ day at 11 a@@ .@@ m@@ . , and he &apos;s no longer a gli@@ m@@ p@@ se of God .
He &apos;s just an aging mor@@ t@@ al with really bad k@@ ne@@ es , and maybe he &apos;s never going to asc@@ end to that he@@ ight again .
And maybe nobody will ever ch@@ ant God &apos;s name again as he sp@@ ins , and what is he then to do with the rest of his life ?
This is hard .
This is one of the most pa@@ in@@ ful re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ations to make in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be quite so full of an@@ gu@@ ish if you never happened to believe , in the first place , that the most extra@@ ordinary asp@@ ects of your being came from you .
But maybe if you just believ@@ ed that they were on lo@@ an to you from some un@@ imagin@@ able source for some ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite por@@ tion of your life to be pass@@ ed along when you &apos;re fin@@ i@@ shed , with somebody else .
And , you know , if we think about it this way , it star@@ ts to change everything .
This is how I &apos;ve started to think , and this is certainly how I &apos;ve been thinking in the last few months as I &apos;ve been working on the book that will soon be publi@@ shed , as the dang@@ er@@ ously , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ingly over@@ -@@ an@@ tic@@ ip@@ ated fol@@ low up to my fre@@ ak@@ ish succ@@ ess .
And what I have to sort of keep telling myself when I get really psy@@ ched out about that is don &apos;t be afr@@ aid .
Don &apos;t be d@@ a@@ un@@ ted . Just do your job .
C@@ ont@@ in@@ ue to show up for your piece of it , whatever that might be .
If your job is to d@@ ance , do your d@@ ance .
If the di@@ v@@ ine , c@@ oc@@ ke@@ y@@ ed gen@@ i@@ us as@@ sign@@ ed to your case deci@@ des to let some sort of wonder@@ ment be gli@@ m@@ p@@ s@@ ed , for just one moment through your ef@@ for@@ ts , then &quot; O@@ l@@ é ! &quot;
And if not , do your d@@ ance any@@ how .
And &quot; O@@ l@@ é ! &quot; to you , non@@ eth@@ eless .
I believe this and I feel that we must teach it .
&quot; O@@ l@@ é ! &quot; to you , non@@ eth@@ eless , just for having the sh@@ e@@ er human love and stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ness to keep showing up .
Thank you .
Thank you .
J@@ une Co@@ h@@ en : O@@ l@@ é !
You know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before -- about the human gen@@ ome and what that might mean , and discover@@ ing new s@@ ets of gen@@ es .
We &apos;re actually starting at a new point : we &apos;ve been dig@@ iti@@ zing biolog@@ y , and now we &apos;re trying to go from that dig@@ ital co@@ de into a new ph@@ ase of biolog@@ y with desig@@ ning and syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zing life .
So , we &apos;ve always been trying to ask big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; is something that I think many biolog@@ ists have been trying to understand at vari@@ ous lev@@ els .
We &apos;ve tried vari@@ ous appro@@ ach@@ es , par@@ ing it down to min@@ im@@ al compon@@ ents .
We &apos;ve been dig@@ iti@@ zing it now for almost 20 years ;
when we sequ@@ enc@@ ed the human gen@@ ome , it was going from the anal@@ o@@ g world of biolog@@ y into the dig@@ ital world of the computer .
Now we &apos;re trying to ask , &quot; Can we re@@ gener@@ ate life or can we create new life out of this dig@@ ital universe ? &quot;
This is the map of a small organ@@ ism , M@@ y@@ cop@@ las@@ ma gen@@ it@@ ali@@ um , that has the small@@ est gen@@ ome for a species that can self-@@ replic@@ ate in the laborat@@ ory ,
and we &apos;ve been trying to just see if we can come up with an even small@@ er gen@@ ome .
We &apos;re able to kno@@ c@@ k out on the order of 100 gen@@ es out of the 500 or so that are here .
When we look at its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ic map , it &apos;s relati@@ vely simple compar@@ ed to ours --
tr@@ ust me , this is simple --
but when we look at all the gen@@ es that we can kno@@ c@@ k out one at a time , it &apos;s very un@@ likely that this would y@@ i@@ el@@ d a living cell .
So we decided the only way forward was to actually syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ze this ch@@ rom@@ os@@ ome so we could v@@ ary the compon@@ ents to ask some of these most fundament@@ al questions .
And so we started down the road of : can we syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ze a ch@@ rom@@ os@@ ome ?
Can ch@@ emis@@ try per@@ m@@ it making these really large molec@@ ules where we &apos;ve never been before ?
And if we do , can we boo@@ t up a ch@@ rom@@ os@@ ome ?
A ch@@ rom@@ os@@ ome , by the way , is just a piece of in@@ ert chem@@ ical material .
So , our p@@ ace of dig@@ iti@@ zing life has been incre@@ as@@ ing at an ex@@ pon@@ ential p@@ ace .
Our ability to write the gen@@ e@@ tic co@@ de has been moving pretty s@@ low@@ ly but has been incre@@ as@@ ing ,
and our lat@@ est point would put it on , now , an ex@@ pon@@ ential cur@@ ve .
We started this over 15 years ago .
It took several st@@ ages , in fact , starting with a bio@@ eth@@ ical re@@ view before we did the first experim@@ ents .
But it turns out syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zing DNA is very difficult .
There are ten@@ s of thousands of mach@@ ines around the world that make small pi@@ eces of DNA -- 30 to 50 let@@ ters in l@@ eng@@ th -- and it &apos;s a de@@ gener@@ ate process , so the longer you make the piece , the more err@@ ors there are .
So we had to create a new me@@ th@@ od for putting these little pi@@ eces together and cor@@ rec@@ t all the err@@ ors .
And this was our first att@@ em@@ pt , starting with the dig@@ ital information of the gen@@ ome of ph@@ i X@@ 1@@ 7@@ 4 .
It &apos;s a small virus that kill@@ s bacteria .
We designed the pi@@ eces , went through our err@@ or cor@@ rec@@ tion and had a DNA molec@@ u@@ le of about 5@@ ,000 let@@ ters .
The exciting ph@@ ase came when we took this piece of in@@ ert chem@@ ical and put it in the bacteria , and the bacteria started to read this gen@@ e@@ tic co@@ de , made the vir@@ al partic@@ les .
The vir@@ al partic@@ les then were rel@@ eas@@ ed from the cells and came back and kill@@ ed the E@@ . coli .
I was talking to the oil industry recently and I said they c@@ lear@@ ly underst@@ ood that model .
They lau@@ gh@@ ed more than you guys are .
And so , we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own har@@ d@@ w@@ are in a biolog@@ ical system .
But we wanted to go much larg@@ er :
we wanted to build the entire bac@@ teri@@ al ch@@ rom@@ os@@ ome --
it &apos;s over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 let@@ ters of gen@@ e@@ tic co@@ de --
so we thought we &apos;d build them in c@@ ass@@ ett@@ es the size of the vir@@ uses so we could actually v@@ ary the c@@ ass@@ ett@@ es to understand what the ac@@ tual compon@@ ents of a living cell are .
D@@ es@@ ig@@ n is crit@@ ical , and if you &apos;re starting with dig@@ ital information in the computer , that dig@@ ital information has to be really acc@@ ur@@ ate .
When we first sequ@@ enc@@ ed this gen@@ ome in 199@@ 5 , the standard of acc@@ ur@@ ac@@ y was one err@@ or per 10@@ ,000 base p@@ air@@ s .
We actually found , on res@@ equ@@ enc@@ ing it , 30 err@@ ors ; had we used that origin@@ al sequ@@ ence , it never would have been able to be bo@@ ot@@ ed up .
Par@@ t of the design is desig@@ ning pi@@ eces that are 50 let@@ ters long that have to over@@ la@@ p with all the other 5@@ 0-@@ l@@ etter pi@@ eces to build small@@ er sub@@ un@@ its we have to design so they can go together .
We design uni@@ que elem@@ ents into this .
You may have read that we put wat@@ er@@ mar@@ ks in .
Th@@ ink of this : we have a f@@ our@@ -@@ l@@ etter gen@@ e@@ tic co@@ de -- A , C , G and T@@ .
T@@ ri@@ pl@@ ets of those let@@ ters co@@ de for r@@ ough@@ ly 20 am@@ ino aci@@ ds , such that there &apos;s a single l@@ etter desig@@ n@@ ation for each of the am@@ ino aci@@ ds .
So we can use the gen@@ e@@ tic co@@ de to write out words , sent@@ ences , thou@@ ghts .
In@@ iti@@ ally , all we did was aut@@ ograp@@ h it .
Some people were dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted there was not po@@ e@@ try .
We designed these pi@@ eces so we can just che@@ w back with enz@@ ym@@ es ;
there are enz@@ ym@@ es that re@@ p@@ air them and put them together .
And we started making pi@@ eces , starting with pi@@ eces that were 5@@ ,000 to 7@@ ,000 let@@ ters , put those together to make 2@@ 4@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0-@@ l@@ etter pi@@ eces , then put s@@ ets of those going up to 7@@ 2@@ ,000 .
At each stage , we gre@@ w up these pi@@ eces in ab@@ un@@ d@@ ance so we could sequ@@ ence them because we &apos;re trying to create a process that &apos;s ex@@ trem@@ ely ro@@ b@@ ust that you can see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to get to the point of autom@@ ation .
So , this looks like a bas@@ k@@ et@@ ball play@@ off .
When we get into these really large pi@@ eces over 10@@ 0,000 base p@@ air@@ s , they won &apos;t any longer grow re@@ a@@ di@@ ly in E@@ . coli --
it ex@@ h@@ au@@ sts all the moder@@ n tools of molec@@ ular biolog@@ y --
and so we turned to other me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms .
We knew there &apos;s a me@@ chan@@ ism called hom@@ olog@@ ous re@@ combin@@ ation that biolog@@ y uses to re@@ p@@ air DNA that can put pi@@ eces together .
Here &apos;s an example of it :
there &apos;s an organ@@ ism called De@@ in@@ oc@@ occu@@ s radi@@ o@@ dur@@ ans that can take three millions rad@@ s of radi@@ ation .
You can see in the top pan@@ el , its ch@@ rom@@ os@@ ome just gets blo@@ wn ap@@ art .
Tw@@ el@@ ve to 24 hours later , it put it back together exactly as it was before .
We have thousands of organis@@ ms that can do this .
These organis@@ ms can be totally des@@ ic@@ c@@ ated ;
they can live in a v@@ ac@@ u@@ um .
I am absolutely certain that life can ex@@ ist in ou@@ ter space , move around , find a new a@@ que@@ ous environment .
In fact , NA@@ SA has sho@@ wn a lot of this is out there .
Here &apos;s an ac@@ tual mic@@ r@@ ograp@@ h of the molec@@ u@@ le we built using these process@@ es , actually just using ye@@ ast me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms with the right design of the pi@@ eces we put them in ;
ye@@ ast p@@ uts them together autom@@ at@@ ically .
This is not an electr@@ on mic@@ r@@ ograp@@ h ; this is just a reg@@ ular ph@@ ot@@ om@@ ic@@ r@@ ograp@@ h .
It &apos;s such a large molec@@ u@@ le we can see it with a light mic@@ ros@@ c@@ ope .
These are pictures over about a si@@ x@@ -@@ second period .
So , this is the pu@@ bl@@ ic@@ ation we had just a short while ago .
This is over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 let@@ ters of gen@@ e@@ tic co@@ de ;
it &apos;s the larg@@ est molec@@ u@@ le ever made by humans of a defin@@ ed structure .
It &apos;s over 300 million molec@@ ular we@@ ight .
If we pr@@ in@@ ted it out at a 10 fon@@ t with no sp@@ ac@@ ing , it takes 1@@ 4@@ 2 pag@@ es just to pr@@ int this gen@@ e@@ tic co@@ de .
Well , how do we boo@@ t up a ch@@ rom@@ os@@ ome ? How do we ac@@ tiv@@ ate this ?
Ob@@ vi@@ ously , with a virus it &apos;s pretty simple ;
it &apos;s much more complic@@ ated de@@ al@@ ing with bacteria .
It &apos;s also sim@@ pl@@ er when you go into e@@ u@@ k@@ ar@@ y@@ ot@@ es like ourselves : you can just po@@ p out the nucle@@ us and po@@ p in another one , and that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all heard about with cl@@ on@@ ing .
W@@ ith bacteria and Ar@@ cha@@ ea , the ch@@ rom@@ os@@ ome is integr@@ ated into the cell , but we recently showed that we can do a compl@@ ete trans@@ pl@@ ant of a ch@@ rom@@ os@@ ome from one cell to another and ac@@ tiv@@ ate it .
We pu@@ ri@@ fied a ch@@ rom@@ os@@ ome from one micro@@ bi@@ al species --
r@@ ough@@ ly , these two are as dist@@ ant as human and m@@ ice --
we ad@@ ded a few ex@@ tra gen@@ es so we could sel@@ ect for this ch@@ rom@@ os@@ ome ,
we dig@@ ested it with enz@@ ym@@ es to k@@ ill all the prote@@ ins ,
and it was pretty st@@ un@@ ning when we put this in the cell -- and you &apos;ll ap@@ preci@@ ate our very s@@ op@@ hist@@ ic@@ ated grap@@ h@@ ics here . The new ch@@ rom@@ os@@ ome went into the cell .
In fact , we thought this might be as far as it went , but we tried to design the process a little bit fur@@ ther .
This is a major me@@ chan@@ ism of evolution right here .
We find all kinds of species that have taken up a second ch@@ rom@@ os@@ ome or a third one from some@@ where , ad@@ ding thousands of new tra@@ its in a second to that species .
So , people who think of evolution as just one gen@@ e changing at a time have mis@@ s@@ ed much of biolog@@ y .
There are enz@@ ym@@ es called res@@ tr@@ ic@@ tion enz@@ ym@@ es that actually dig@@ est DNA .
The ch@@ rom@@ os@@ ome that was in the cell doesn &apos;t have one ;
the ch@@ rom@@ os@@ ome we put in does .
It got ex@@ press@@ ed and it recogni@@ zed the other ch@@ rom@@ os@@ ome as for@@ e@@ ig@@ n material , che@@ wed it up , and so we en@@ ded up just with a cell with the new ch@@ rom@@ os@@ ome .
It turned blue because of the gen@@ es we put in it .
And with a very short period of time , all the charac@@ ter@@ ist@@ ics of one species were lost and it conver@@ ted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell .
All the prote@@ ins changed , the membr@@ an@@ es changed ; when we read the gen@@ e@@ tic co@@ de , it &apos;s exactly what we had trans@@ fer@@ red in .
So , this may sound like gen@@ om@@ ic al@@ chem@@ y , but we can , by moving the software of DNA around , change things quite d@@ ram@@ at@@ ically .
Now I &apos;ve ar@@ gu@@ ed , this is not gen@@ es@@ is ; this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution . And I &apos;ve ar@@ gu@@ ed that we &apos;re about to perhaps create a new version of the C@@ amb@@ ri@@ an expl@@ os@@ ion , where there &apos;s mas@@ sive new speci@@ ation based on this dig@@ ital design .
Why do this ?
I think this is pretty obvi@@ ous in terms of some of the needs .
We &apos;re about to go from six and a half to n@@ ine billion people over the next 40 years .
To put it in cont@@ ext for myself : I was born in 19@@ 4@@ 6 .
There are now three people on the planet for every one of us that exist@@ ed in 19@@ 4@@ 6 ; within 40 years , there &apos;ll be four .
We have tr@@ ouble fe@@ ed@@ ing , prov@@ id@@ ing f@@ res@@ h , cle@@ an water , medic@@ ines , fu@@ el for the six and a half billion .
It &apos;s going to be a str@@ et@@ ch to do it for n@@ ine .
We use over five billion t@@ ons of co@@ al , 30 bil@@ li@@ on@@ -@@ pl@@ us bar@@ rel@@ s of oil --
that &apos;s a hundre@@ d million bar@@ rel@@ s a day .
When we try to think of biolog@@ ical process@@ es or any process to re@@ place that , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
Then of course , there &apos;s all that CO2 from this material that ends up in the atmos@@ phere .
We now , from our discover@@ y around the world , have a d@@ at@@ ab@@ ase with about 20 million gen@@ es , and I like to think of these as the design compon@@ ents of the future .
The electr@@ on@@ ics industry only had a do@@ z@@ en or so compon@@ ents , and look at the divers@@ ity that came out of that .
We &apos;re lim@@ ited here prim@@ ari@@ ly by a biolog@@ ical reality and our imagin@@ ation .
We now have tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es , because of these rap@@ id me@@ th@@ o@@ ds of syn@@ th@@ es@@ is , to do what we &apos;re call@@ ing combin@@ at@@ ori@@ al gen@@ om@@ ics .
We have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million ch@@ rom@@ os@@ om@@ es a day .
When you think of process@@ ing these 20 million different gen@@ es or trying to op@@ ti@@ mi@@ ze process@@ es to produce oc@@ t@@ ane or to produce ph@@ ar@@ mac@@ e@@ ut@@ ic@@ als , new vacc@@ ines , we can just with a small team , do more molec@@ ular biolog@@ y than the last 20 years of all science .
And it &apos;s just standard sel@@ ection :
we can sel@@ ect for vi@@ ability , chem@@ ical or fu@@ el produc@@ tion , vacc@@ ine produc@@ tion , et@@ c .
This is a scre@@ en s@@ n@@ ap@@ sho@@ t of some true design software that we &apos;re working on to actually be able to sit down and design species in the computer .
You know , we don &apos;t know necessari@@ ly what it &apos;ll look like :
we know exactly what their gen@@ e@@ tic co@@ de looks like .
We &apos;re foc@@ using on now f@@ our@@ th@@ -@@ generation fu@@ els .
You &apos;ve seen recently , cor@@ n to eth@@ an@@ ol is just a bad experiment .
We have secon@@ d@@ - and th@@ ir@@ d-@@ generation fu@@ els that will be coming out relati@@ vely soon that are su@@ g@@ ar , to much high@@ er@@ -@@ value fu@@ els like oc@@ t@@ ane or different ty@@ pes of b@@ ut@@ an@@ ol .
But the only way we think that biolog@@ y can have a major impact without fur@@ ther incre@@ as@@ ing the cost of food and lim@@ iting its avail@@ ability is if we start with CO2 as its fe@@ ed@@ st@@ ock , and so we &apos;re working with desig@@ ning cells to go down this road . And we think we &apos;ll have the first f@@ our@@ th@@ -@@ generation fu@@ els in about 18 months .
S@@ un@@ light and CO2 is one me@@ th@@ od ... but in our discover@@ y around the world , we have all kinds of other me@@ th@@ o@@ ds .
This is an organ@@ ism we descri@@ bed in 199@@ 6 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about a mile and a half deep , almost at bo@@ il@@ ing@@ -@@ water temper@@ atures .
It takes CO2 to me@@ th@@ ane using molec@@ ular hy@@ drog@@ en as its energy source .
We &apos;re looking to see if we can take cap@@ tu@@ red CO2 , which can easi@@ ly be pi@@ ped to s@@ ites , conver@@ t that CO2 back into fu@@ el to drive this process .
So , in a short period of time , we think that we might be able to incre@@ ase what the basic question is of &quot; What is life ? &quot; We tru@@ ly , you know , have mo@@ des@@ t go@@ als of re@@ plac@@ ing the whole petrol@@ -@@ chem@@ ical industry --
Yeah . If you can &apos;t do that at TED , where can you ? --
become a major source of energy ...
But also , we &apos;re now working on using these same tools to come up with inst@@ ant s@@ ets of vacc@@ ines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with fl@@ u ; we &apos;re always a year behind and a dol@@ l@@ ar short when it comes to the right vacc@@ ine .
I think that can be changed by building combin@@ at@@ ori@@ al vacc@@ ines in adv@@ ance .
Here &apos;s what the future may begin to look like with changing , now , the evol@@ uti@@ on@@ ary tree , spe@@ ed@@ ing up evolution with syn@@ the@@ tic bacteria , Ar@@ cha@@ ea and , ev@@ entu@@ ally , e@@ u@@ k@@ ar@@ y@@ ot@@ es .
We &apos;re a ways away from improv@@ ing people :
our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to sur@@ vive long enough to maybe do that . Thank you very much .
What I &apos;m going to show you first , as quickly as I can , is some f@@ ound@@ ational work , some new technology that we brought to M@@ ic@@ ros@@ o@@ ft as part of an acqu@@ is@@ ition almost exactly a year ago . This is S@@ e@@ ad@@ rag@@ on , and it &apos;s an environment
in which you can either loc@@ ally or re@@ mot@@ ely inter@@ act with v@@ ast am@@ oun@@ ts of visu@@ al data .
We &apos;re looking at many , many gi@@ g@@ ab@@ y@@ t@@ es of dig@@ ital ph@@ ot@@ os here and kind of se@@ am@@ less@@ ly and continu@@ ously z@@ o@@ om@@ ing in , pan@@ ning through it , re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ging it in any way we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we &apos;re looking at , how big these coll@@ ec@@ tions are or how big the images are .
M@@ ost of them are ordinary dig@@ ital camera ph@@ ot@@ os , but this one , for example , is a sc@@ an from the Li@@ br@@ ary of Con@@ gr@@ ess , and it &apos;s in the 300 me@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el ran@@ ge .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that ought to lim@@ it the performan@@ ce of a system like this one is the number of pi@@ x@@ els on your scre@@ en at any given moment . It &apos;s also very f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble architecture .
This is an entire book , so this is an example of non-@@ image data .
This is &quot; B@@ le@@ ak H@@ ouse &quot; by D@@ ick@@ ens . E@@ very col@@ um@@ n is a ch@@ ap@@ ter .
To prove to you that it &apos;s really t@@ ext , and not an image , we can do something like so , to really show that this is a real re@@ present@@ ation of the t@@ ext ; it &apos;s not a picture .
May@@ be this is an artifici@@ al way to read an e-@@ book .
I wouldn &apos;t re@@ com@@ men@@ d it .
This is a more real@@ ist@@ ic case , an issue of The Gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an .
E@@ very large image is the beginning of a sec@@ tion .
And this really gives you the jo@@ y and the good experience of reading the real paper version of a mag@@ az@@ ine or a ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er , which is an in@@ her@@ ently multi@@ -@@ scale kind of medi@@ um .
We &apos;ve done something with the cor@@ ner of this particular issue of The Gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an .
We &apos;ve made up a fa@@ ke ad that &apos;s very high res@@ ol@@ ution -- much high@@ er than in an ordinary ad -- and we &apos;ve em@@ be@@ d@@ ded ex@@ tra cont@@ ent .
If you want to see the fe@@ atures of this car , you can see it here .
Or other model@@ s , or even tech@@ n@@ ical speci@@ fic@@ ations .
And this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those lim@@ its on scre@@ en real est@@ ate .
We hope that this means no more pop@@ -@@ up@@ s and other ru@@ b@@ bi@@ sh like that -- sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be necess@@ ary .
Of course , mapp@@ ing is one of those obvi@@ ous applic@@ ations for a technology like this .
And this one I really won &apos;t spend any time on , exc@@ ept to say that we have things to contribu@@ te to this field as well .
But those are all the ro@@ ad@@ s in the U.S. super@@ im@@ posed on top of a NA@@ SA ge@@ osp@@ ati@@ al image .
So let &apos;s pul@@ l up , now , something else .
This is actually live on the We@@ b now ; you can go ch@@ ec@@ k it out .
This is a project called Ph@@ ot@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ th , which mar@@ ri@@ es two different technologies .
One of them is S@@ e@@ ad@@ rag@@ on and the other is some very beautiful comput@@ er@@ -@@ vision research done by No@@ ah S@@ n@@ av@@ ely , a grad@@ u@@ ate stud@@ ent at the Univers@@ ity of Washington , co@@ -@@ ad@@ vis@@ ed by St@@ eve S@@ e@@ it@@ z at U.@@ W@@ . and R@@ ick S@@ z@@ el@@ is@@ k@@ i at M@@ ic@@ ros@@ o@@ ft R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch . A very nice collabor@@ ation .
And so this is live on the We@@ b . It &apos;s power@@ ed by S@@ e@@ ad@@ rag@@ on .
You can see that when we do these sor@@ ts of vie@@ ws , where we can di@@ ve through images and have this kind of multi@@ -@@ res@@ ol@@ ution experience .
But the sp@@ ati@@ al ar@@ ran@@ g@@ ement of the images here is actually mean@@ ing@@ ful .
The computer vision al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms have regi@@ ster@@ ed these images together so that they cor@@ respon@@ d to the real space in which these sh@@ ots -- all taken ne@@ ar Gr@@ as@@ si La@@ kes in the C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an R@@ ock@@ ies -- all these sh@@ ots were taken . So you see elem@@ ents here of sta@@ bili@@ zed sli@@ de@@ -@@ show or pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic imag@@ ing , and these things have all been rel@@ ated sp@@ ati@@ ally .
I &apos;m not sure if I have time to show you any other environ@@ ments .
Some are much more sp@@ ati@@ al .
I would like to j@@ ump str@@ ai@@ ght to one of No@@ ah &apos;s origin@@ al d@@ at@@ a-@@ s@@ ets -- this is from an early prot@@ ot@@ y@@ pe that we first got working this sum@@ mer -- to show you what I think is really the pun@@ ch line behind the Ph@@ ot@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ th technology , It &apos;s not necessari@@ ly so appar@@ ent from looking at the environ@@ ments we &apos;ve put up on the w@@ eb@@ site .
We had to wor@@ ry about the la@@ w@@ y@@ ers and so on .
This is a re@@ construc@@ tion of No@@ tre D@@ ame C@@ a@@ the@@ dr@@ al that was done enti@@ rel@@ y comput@@ ati@@ on@@ ally from images sc@@ rap@@ ed from F@@ l@@ ick@@ r . You just type No@@ tre D@@ ame into F@@ l@@ ick@@ r , and you get some pictures of guys in T@@ -@@ sh@@ ir@@ ts , and of the cam@@ pu@@ s and so on . And each of these or@@ an@@ ge con@@ es re@@ pres@@ ents an image that was discovered to bel@@ ong to this model .
And so these are all F@@ l@@ ick@@ r images , and they &apos;ve all been rel@@ ated sp@@ ati@@ ally in this way .
We can just n@@ av@@ ig@@ ate in this very simple way .
You know , I never thought that I &apos;d end up working at M@@ ic@@ ros@@ o@@ ft .
It &apos;s very gr@@ ati@@ f@@ ying to have this kind of rec@@ ep@@ tion here .
I guess you can see this is lots of different ty@@ pes of cam@@ er@@ as : it &apos;s everything from cell@@ -@@ phone cam@@ er@@ as to professi@@ onal S@@ L@@ R@@ s , quite a large number of them , st@@ it@@ ched together in this environment .
If I can find some of the sort of we@@ ird ones --
So many of them are oc@@ clu@@ ded by fac@@ es , and so on .
Some@@ where in here there is actually a series of photograp@@ h@@ s -- here we go .
This is actually a pos@@ ter of No@@ tre D@@ ame that regi@@ ster@@ ed cor@@ rec@@ tly .
We can di@@ ve in from the pos@@ ter to a physical view of this environment .
What the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment . This is now taking data from everybody -- from the entire coll@@ ective mem@@ ory , visu@@ ally , of what the Earth looks like -- and lin@@ k all of that together .
Th@@ ose ph@@ ot@@ os become lin@@ ked , and they make something emer@@ g@@ ent that &apos;s gre@@ ater than the su@@ m of the parts .
You have a model that emer@@ ges of the entire Earth .
Th@@ ink of this as the long tail to Ste@@ ph@@ en L@@ aw@@ ler &apos;s V@@ ir@@ tual Earth work .
And this is something that gro@@ ws in compl@@ ex@@ ity as people use it , and wh@@ ose benef@@ its become gre@@ ater to the us@@ ers as they use it .
Th@@ e@@ ir own ph@@ ot@@ os are getting t@@ ag@@ g@@ ed with met@@ a-@@ data that somebody else enter@@ ed .
If somebody bo@@ ther@@ ed to ta@@ g all of these s@@ ain@@ ts and say who they all are , then my ph@@ oto of No@@ tre D@@ ame C@@ a@@ the@@ dr@@ al sud@@ den@@ ly gets en@@ ri@@ ched with all of that data , and I can use it as an entr@@ y point to di@@ ve into that space , into that met@@ a-@@ ver@@ se , using everybody else &apos;s ph@@ ot@@ os , and do a kind of a cr@@ oss@@ -@@ mo@@ dal and cr@@ oss@@ -@@ us@@ er social experience that way .
And of course , a b@@ y-@@ product of all of that is im@@ men@@ sel@@ y r@@ ich vir@@ tual model@@ s of every interesting part of the Earth , coll@@ ected not just from over@@ head f@@ li@@ ghts and from sat@@ ell@@ ite images and so on , but from the coll@@ ective mem@@ ory .
Thank you so much .
Chris Anderson : Do I understand this right ? What your software is going to allow , is that at some point , really within the next few years , all the pictures that are shar@@ ed by anyone across the world are going to lin@@ k together ?
B@@ A@@ A : Yes . What this is really doing is discover@@ ing ,
creating hy@@ per@@ lin@@ ks , if you will , between images .
It &apos;s doing that based on the cont@@ ent inside the images .
And that gets really exciting when you think about the ri@@ ch@@ ness of the sem@@ anti@@ c information a lot of images have .
Li@@ ke when you do a web se@@ ar@@ ch for images , you type in ph@@ r@@ ases , and the t@@ ext on the web p@@ age is car@@ r@@ ying a lot of information about what that picture is of .
What if that picture lin@@ ks to all of your pictures ?
The amount of sem@@ anti@@ c inter@@ connec@@ tion and ri@@ ch@@ ness that comes out of that is really huge .
It &apos;s a clas@@ sic network effect .
CA : T@@ ru@@ ly incredible . Con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ations .
You know , one of the inten@@ se pl@@ eas@@ u@@ res of trav@@ el and one of the del@@ i@@ ghts of eth@@ n@@ ograp@@ hic research is the opportunity to live am@@ ong@@ st those who have not for@@ g@@ ott@@ en the old ways , who still feel their past in the wind , tou@@ ch it in st@@ ones pol@@ i@@ shed by ra@@ in , tast@@ e it in the b@@ itt@@ er le@@ av@@ es of plants .
Just to know that J@@ ag@@ u@@ ar sh@@ am@@ ans still jour@@ ney beyond the Mil@@ ky W@@ ay , or the my@@ ths of the In@@ u@@ it el@@ ders still res@@ on@@ ate with mean@@ ing , or that in the H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ a , the Bu@@ dd@@ hist@@ s still pur@@ sue the bre@@ ath of the D@@ har@@ ma , is to really remember the centr@@ al re@@ vel@@ ation of an@@ thr@@ op@@ ology , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not ex@@ ist in some ab@@ sol@@ ute sense , but is just one model of reality ,
the con@@ sequ@@ ence of one particular set of ad@@ ap@@ tive cho@@ ices that our lin@@ e@@ age made , al@@ be@@ it success@@ fully , many gener@@ ations ago .
And of course , we all share the same ad@@ ap@@ tive im@@ per@@ ati@@ ves .
We &apos;re all born . We all bring our children into the world .
We go through in@@ iti@@ ation rit@@ es .
We have to deal with the in@@ ex@@ or@@ able separ@@ ation of death , so it sh@@ ouldn &apos;t sur@@ pri@@ se us that we all sing , we all d@@ ance ,
we all have art .
But what &apos;s interesting is the uni@@ que cad@@ ence of the song , the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of the d@@ ance in every culture .
And whether it is the Pen@@ an in the for@@ ests of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o , or the V@@ oo@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ t@@ es in H@@ a@@ iti , or the war@@ ri@@ ors in the K@@ ai@@ su@@ t des@@ ert of Nor@@ ther@@ n Ken@@ ya , the C@@ ur@@ and@@ ero in the moun@@ ta@@ ins of the An@@ des , or a car@@ av@@ an@@ ser@@ ai in the middle of the S@@ a@@ har@@ a --
this is incid@@ ent@@ ally the fel@@ low that I trav@@ el@@ ed into the des@@ ert with a month ago -- or inde@@ ed a y@@ ak her@@ der in the sl@@ op@@ es of Q@@ om@@ ol@@ ang@@ ma , Ever@@ est , the go@@ d@@ des@@ s mother of the world .
All of these pe@@ op@@ les teach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of ori@@ ent@@ ing yourself in the Earth .
And this is an idea , if you think about it , can only f@@ ill you with hope .
Now , together the my@@ ri@@ ad cul@@ tures of the world make up a web of spi@@ rit@@ ual life and cultur@@ al life that en@@ vel@@ ops the planet , and is as important to the w@@ ell@@ -@@ being of the planet as inde@@ ed is the biolog@@ ical web of life that you know as a bi@@ osp@@ here .
And you might think of this cultur@@ al web of life as being an eth@@ n@@ osp@@ here , and you might de@@ fine the eth@@ n@@ osp@@ here as being the su@@ m tot@@ al of all thou@@ ghts and dre@@ ams , my@@ ths , ideas , inspi@@ r@@ ations , intu@@ itions brought into being by the human imagin@@ ation since the d@@ a@@ wn of consci@@ ous@@ ness .
The eth@@ n@@ osp@@ here is human@@ ity &apos;s great leg@@ ac@@ y .
It &apos;s the sym@@ bo@@ l of all that we are and all that we can be as an ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ ingly in@@ qu@@ is@@ itive species .
And just as the bi@@ osp@@ here has been sever@@ ely ero@@ ded , so too is the eth@@ n@@ osp@@ here -- and , if anything , at a far gre@@ ater rate .
No biolog@@ ists , for example , would dare sugg@@ est that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the br@@ ink of ext@@ inc@@ tion because it simply is not true , and yet that -- the most ap@@ oc@@ al@@ y@@ p@@ tic scen@@ ario in the real@@ m of biolog@@ ical divers@@ ity -- scar@@ c@@ ely appro@@ ach@@ es what we know to be the most op@@ ti@@ mist@@ ic scen@@ ario in the real@@ m of cultur@@ al divers@@ ity .
And the great indic@@ ator of that , of course , is language l@@ oss .
When each of you in this room were born , there were 6@@ ,000 langu@@ ages spo@@ ken on the planet .
Now , a language is not just a body of v@@ oc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary or a set of gr@@ am@@ mat@@ ical rules .
A language is a f@@ las@@ h of the human spiri@@ t .
It &apos;s a ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le through which the s@@ ou@@ l of each particular culture comes into the material world .
E@@ very language is an ol@@ d-@@ growth for@@ est of the mind , a wat@@ er@@ shed , a thought , an ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem of spi@@ rit@@ ual possi@@ bil@@ ities .
And of those 6@@ ,000 langu@@ ages , as we sit here today in Mon@@ ter@@ ey , fully half are no longer being wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed into the ear@@ s of children .
They &apos;re no longer being ta@@ u@@ ght to ba@@ bi@@ es , which means , eff@@ ec@@ ti@@ vely , un@@ less something changes , they &apos;re already dead .
What could be more l@@ on@@ ely than to be en@@ vel@@ op@@ ed in sil@@ ence , to be the last of your people to speak your language , to have no way to pas@@ s on the w@@ is@@ dom of the anc@@ est@@ ors or an@@ tic@@ ip@@ ate the prom@@ ise of the children ?
And yet , that dre@@ ad@@ ful fate is inde@@ ed the p@@ light of somebody some@@ where on Earth r@@ ough@@ ly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some el@@ der dies and car@@ ri@@ es with him into the gr@@ ave the last sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ les of an anci@@ ent ton@@ gue .
And I know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; Well , wouldn &apos;t it be better ,
wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just spo@@ ke one language ? &quot; And I say , &quot; Gre@@ at , let &apos;s make that language Yor@@ u@@ ba . Let &apos;s make it C@@ ant@@ on@@ ese .
Let &apos;s make it K@@ og@@ i . &quot;
And you &apos;ll sud@@ den@@ ly disc@@ over what it would be like to be un@@ able to speak your own language .
And so , what I &apos;d like to do with you today is sort of take you on a jour@@ ney through the eth@@ n@@ osp@@ here ,
a bri@@ ef jour@@ ney through the eth@@ n@@ osp@@ here , to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost .
Now , there are many of us who sort of for@@ get that when I say &quot; different ways of being , &quot; I really do mean different ways of being .
T@@ ake , for example , this child of a Bar@@ as@@ ana in the Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ma@@ z@@ on , the people of the an@@ ac@@ on@@ da who believe that my@@ th@@ olog@@ ically they came up the mil@@ k riv@@ er from the e@@ ast in the bel@@ ly of sac@@ red s@@ n@@ a@@ kes .
Now , this is a people who c@@ ogn@@ iti@@ vely do not dist@@ ingu@@ ish the color blue from the color green because the can@@ op@@ y of the he@@ av@@ ens is equ@@ ated to the can@@ op@@ y of the for@@ est up@@ on which the people de@@ pen@@ d .
They have a curi@@ ous language and mar@@ ri@@ age ru@@ le which is called &quot; lingu@@ ist@@ ic ex@@ og@@ am@@ y : &quot; you must mar@@ ry someone who spe@@ a@@ ks a different language .
And this is all ro@@ ot@@ ed in the my@@ th@@ olog@@ ical past , yet the curi@@ ous thing is in these long h@@ ous@@ es , where there are six or seven langu@@ ages spo@@ ken because of inter@@ mar@@ ri@@ age , you never hear anyone prac@@ tic@@ ing a language .
They simply list@@ en and then begin to speak .
Or , one of the most fas@@ cin@@ ating trib@@ es I ever lived with , the W@@ a@@ or@@ ani of nor@@ the@@ ast@@ er@@ n E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or , an ast@@ oni@@ shing people first cont@@ ac@@ ted pe@@ ac@@ ef@@ ully in 19@@ 5@@ 8 .
In 19@@ 5@@ 7 , five mis@@ sion@@ ar@@ ies att@@ em@@ p@@ ted cont@@ act and made a crit@@ ical mi@@ sta@@ ke .
They dr@@ op@@ ped from the air 8 x 10 gl@@ oss@@ y photograp@@ h@@ s of themselves in what we would say to be fri@@ end@@ ly g@@ es@@ tures , for@@ getting that these people of the ra@@ in@@ for@@ est had never seen anything tw@@ o-@@ dimen@@ si@@ onal in their lives .
They pic@@ ked up these photograp@@ h@@ s from the for@@ est flo@@ or , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and conclu@@ ded that these were call@@ ing car@@ ds from the dev@@ il , so they spe@@ ar@@ ed the five mis@@ sion@@ ar@@ ies to death .
But the W@@ a@@ or@@ ani didn &apos;t just spe@@ ar out@@ si@@ ders .
They spe@@ ar@@ ed each other .
5@@ 4 percent of their mor@@ tal@@ ity was due to them spe@@ ar@@ ing each other .
We trac@@ ed gen@@ e@@ al@@ og@@ ies back eight gener@@ ations , and we found two inst@@ ances of natural death and when we pres@@ su@@ red the people a little bit about it , they ad@@ m@@ itt@@ ed that one of the fel@@ lows had g@@ ott@@ en so old that he died getting old , so we spe@@ ar@@ ed him any@@ way . But at the same time they had a per@@ sp@@ ic@@ aci@@ ous knowledge of the for@@ est that was ast@@ oni@@ shing .
Th@@ e@@ ir hun@@ ters could sm@@ ell animal ur@@ ine at 40 p@@ ac@@ es and tell you what species left it behind .
In the early &apos; 8@@ 0s , I had a really ast@@ oni@@ shing as@@ sign@@ ment when I was asked by my prof@@ ess@@ or at Har@@ v@@ ard if I was interested in going down to H@@ a@@ iti , in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ating the sec@@ re@@ t soci@@ eti@@ es which were the f@@ ound@@ ation of D@@ u@@ v@@ ali@@ er &apos;s str@@ eng@@ th and T@@ ont@@ on M@@ ac@@ out@@ es , and sec@@ ur@@ ing the po@@ is@@ on used to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es .
In order to make sense out of sens@@ ation , of course , I had to understand something about this re@@ mark@@ able fa@@ ith of V@@ od@@ ou@@ n . And V@@ oo@@ do@@ o is not a black mag@@ ic cul@@ t .
On the contr@@ ary , it &apos;s a complex met@@ ap@@ hy@@ s@@ ical worl@@ d@@ view .
It &apos;s interesting .
If I asked you to name the great religi@@ ons of the world , what would you say ?
Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an@@ ity , I@@ sl@@ am , Bu@@ dd@@ h@@ ism , Ju@@ d@@ a@@ ism , whatever .
There &apos;s always one contin@@ ent left out , the assum@@ p@@ tion being that sub@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ har@@ an Africa had no religi@@ ous beli@@ ef@@ s . Well , of course , they did and V@@ oo@@ do@@ o is simply the dist@@ ill@@ ation of these very prof@@ ound religi@@ ous ideas that came over during the trag@@ ic Di@@ as@@ por@@ a of the s@@ lav@@ ery era .
But , what makes V@@ oo@@ do@@ o so interesting is that it &apos;s this living relationship between the living and the dead .
So , the living give bir@@ th to the spi@@ rit@@ s .
The spi@@ rit@@ s can be inv@@ o@@ ked from ben@@ e@@ ath the Gre@@ at W@@ ater , respon@@ ding to the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of the d@@ ance to mom@@ ent@@ ari@@ ly dis@@ place the s@@ ou@@ l of the living , so that for that bri@@ ef sh@@ in@@ ing moment , the ac@@ ol@@ y@@ te becomes the go@@ d .
That &apos;s why the V@@ oo@@ do@@ o@@ ists like to say that &quot; You white people go to ch@@ ur@@ ch and speak about God .
We d@@ ance in the tem@@ ple and become God . &quot;
And because you are pos@@ s@@ ess@@ ed , you are taken by the spiri@@ t -- how can you be har@@ m@@ ed ?
So you see these ast@@ oni@@ shing de@@ mon@@ str@@ ations : V@@ oo@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ t@@ es in a state of tr@@ ance hand@@ ling bur@@ ning em@@ bers with im@@ pun@@ ity , a rather ast@@ oni@@ shing de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation of the ability of the mind to aff@@ ect the body that be@@ ars it when cat@@ al@@ y@@ zed in the state of ex@@ tr@@ eme exc@@ it@@ ation .
Now , of all the pe@@ op@@ les that I &apos;ve ever been with , the most extra@@ ordinary are the K@@ og@@ i of the Si@@ erra N@@ ev@@ ada de S@@ anta Mar@@ ta in nor@@ ther@@ n Col@@ om@@ bia .
D@@ esc@@ end@@ ants of the anci@@ ent T@@ air@@ ona civi@@ li@@ zation which once car@@ pet@@ ed the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pl@@ ain of Col@@ om@@ bia , in the wa@@ ke of the con@@ ques@@ t , these people re@@ tre@@ ated into an i@@ sol@@ ated vol@@ can@@ ic mas@@ si@@ f that so@@ ars ab@@ ove the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pl@@ ain .
In a bloo@@ d@@ st@@ ain@@ ed contin@@ ent , these people alone were never con@@ qu@@ ered by the S@@ pan@@ ish .
To this day , they re@@ main r@@ ul@@ ed by a rit@@ ual pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood but the train@@ ing for the pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood is rather extra@@ ordinary .
The young ac@@ ol@@ y@@ t@@ es are taken away from their famili@@ es at the age of three and four , se@@ ques@@ ter@@ ed in a sh@@ ad@@ ow@@ y world of dar@@ k@@ ness in st@@ one h@@ uts at the base of gl@@ aci@@ ers for 18 years :
two n@@ in@@ e-@@ year peri@@ o@@ ds del@@ i@@ ber@@ ately ch@@ os@@ en to m@@ im@@ ic the n@@ ine months of g@@ est@@ ation they spend in their natural mother &apos;s wom@@ b ; now they are met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ically in the wom@@ b of the great mother .
And for this entire time , they are inc@@ ul@@ tur@@ ated into the val@@ ues of their society , val@@ ues that main@@ tain the propos@@ ition that their pr@@ ay@@ ers and their pr@@ ay@@ ers alone main@@ tain the cos@@ mic -- or we might say the ec@@ olog@@ ical -- bal@@ ance .
And at the end of this amazing in@@ iti@@ ation , one day they &apos;re sud@@ den@@ ly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a sun@@ ri@@ se . And in that cr@@ y@@ st@@ al moment of a@@ war@@ en@@ ess of first light as the S@@ un beg@@ ins to ba@@ the the sl@@ op@@ es of the st@@ un@@ n@@ ingly beautiful land@@ sc@@ ape , sud@@ den@@ ly everything they have learned in the ab@@ str@@ act is aff@@ ir@@ m@@ ed in st@@ un@@ ning gl@@ ory . And the pri@@ est ste@@ ps back
and says , &quot; You see ? It &apos;s really as I &apos;ve told you .
It is that beautiful . It is y@@ ours to prot@@ ect . &quot;
They call themselves the &quot; el@@ der bro@@ thers &quot; and they say we , who are the youn@@ ger bro@@ thers , are the ones responsi@@ ble for des@@ tro@@ ying the world .
Now , this level of intu@@ ition becomes very important .
Wh@@ en@@ ever we think of indi@@ gen@@ ous people and land@@ sc@@ ape , we either inv@@ o@@ ke R@@ ous@@ se@@ a@@ u and the old can@@ ard of the &quot; no@@ ble sav@@ age , &quot; which is an idea rac@@ ist in its sim@@ plic@@ ity , or altern@@ ati@@ vely , we inv@@ o@@ ke Th@@ or@@ ea@@ u and say these people are clos@@ er to the Earth than we are .
Well , indi@@ gen@@ ous people are ne@@ i@@ ther sen@@ tim@@ ent@@ al n@@ or we@@ ak@@ en@@ ed by n@@ os@@ tal@@ gia .
There &apos;s not a lot of room for either in the mal@@ ari@@ al sw@@ am@@ ps of the A@@ sm@@ at or in the ch@@ ill@@ ing win@@ ds of Ti@@ be@@ t , but they have , n@@ ever@@ th@@ eless , through time and rit@@ ual , for@@ g@@ ed a trad@@ iti@@ onal my@@ sti@@ que of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-@@ consci@@ ously close to it , but on a far sub@@ t@@ ler intu@@ ition : the idea that the Earth itself can only ex@@ ist because it is brea@@ th@@ ed into being by human consci@@ ous@@ ness .
Now , what does that mean ?
It means that a young kid from the An@@ des who &apos;s ra@@ is@@ ed to believe that that moun@@ tain is an Ap@@ u spiri@@ t that will direc@@ t his or her des@@ tiny will be a prof@@ ound@@ ly different human being and have a different relationship to that resour@@ ce or that place than a young kid from M@@ ont@@ ana ra@@ is@@ ed to believe that a moun@@ tain is a pi@@ le of roc@@ k ready to be min@@ ed .
Wh@@ ether it &apos;s the ab@@ o@@ de of a spiri@@ t or a pi@@ le of ore is ir@@ rel@@ ev@@ ant .
What &apos;s interesting is the met@@ ap@@ h@@ or that defin@@ es the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I was ra@@ is@@ ed in the for@@ ests of Brit@@ ish Col@@ um@@ bia to believe those for@@ ests exist@@ ed to be cut .
That made me a different human being than my friends am@@ ong@@ st the K@@ w@@ ag@@ i@@ ul@@ th who believe that those for@@ ests were the ab@@ o@@ de of H@@ u@@ x@@ wh@@ u@@ k@@ w and the C@@ ro@@ o@@ ked Be@@ ak of H@@ e@@ av@@ en and the can@@ ni@@ b@@ al spi@@ rit@@ s that d@@ w@@ ell@@ ed at the nor@@ th end of the world , spi@@ rit@@ s they would have to eng@@ age during their H@@ am@@ at@@ sa in@@ iti@@ ation .
Now , if you begin to look at the idea that these cul@@ tures could create different real@@ ities , you could begin to understand some of their extra@@ ordinary discover@@ ies . T@@ ake this pl@@ ant here .
It &apos;s a photograp@@ h I took in the Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ma@@ z@@ on just last A@@ pr@@ il .
This is ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psy@@ cho@@ active prepar@@ ation of the sh@@ am@@ an &apos;s re@@ per@@ to@@ ire .
What makes ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca fas@@ cin@@ ating is not the sh@@ e@@ er ph@@ ar@@ mac@@ olog@@ ical pot@@ ential of this prepar@@ ation , but the el@@ abor@@ ation of it . It &apos;s made really of two different sour@@ ces :
on the one hand , this w@@ oo@@ dy li@@ ana which has in it a series of bet@@ a-@@ carb@@ ol@@ ines , har@@ mine , har@@ mal@@ ine , mil@@ d@@ ly h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ ogen@@ ic --
to take the v@@ ine alone is rather to have sort of blue h@@ az@@ y s@@ mo@@ ke dri@@ ft across your consci@@ ous@@ ness -- but it &apos;s mi@@ x@@ ed with the le@@ av@@ es of a sh@@ ru@@ b in the co@@ ff@@ ee family called P@@ sy@@ cho@@ tria vi@@ ri@@ d@@ is .
This pl@@ ant had in it some very powerful tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ am@@ ines , very close to brain ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in , di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ am@@ ine , 5@@ -@@ me@@ th@@ ox@@ y@@ di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ am@@ ine .
If you &apos;ve ever seen the Y@@ an@@ om@@ ami blo@@ wing that s@@ nu@@ ff up their n@@ os@@ es , that sub@@ st@@ ance they make from a different set of species also con@@ ta@@ ins me@@ th@@ ox@@ y@@ di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ am@@ ine .
To have that po@@ w@@ der blo@@ wn up your n@@ ose is rather like being sho@@ t out of a ri@@ f@@ le bar@@ re@@ l lin@@ ed with bar@@ o@@ que pa@@ int@@ ings and l@@ anding on a sea of electr@@ icity . It doesn &apos;t create the di@@ stor@@ tion of reality ; it cre@@ ates the dis@@ solution of reality .
In fact , I used to ar@@ gue with my prof@@ ess@@ or , Richard E@@ v@@ an Sh@@ ul@@ t@@ es -- who is a man who spar@@ ked the psy@@ che@@ del@@ ic era with his discover@@ y of the mag@@ ic mus@@ h@@ ro@@ om@@ s in M@@ ex@@ ico in the 19@@ 3@@ 0s --
I used to ar@@ gue that you couldn &apos;t clas@@ si@@ fy these tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ am@@ ines as h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ ogen@@ ic because by the time you &apos;re under the eff@@ ects there &apos;s no one home any@@ more to experience a h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ ation . But the thing about tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ am@@ ines is they cannot be taken or@@ ally because they &apos;re den@@ atu@@ red by an enz@@ y@@ me found natur@@ ally in the human g@@ ut called mon@@ o@@ am@@ ine ox@@ id@@ ase .
They can only be taken or@@ ally if taken in con@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ tion with some other chem@@ ical that den@@ atures the M@@ A@@ O .
Now , the fas@@ cin@@ ating things are that the bet@@ a-@@ carb@@ ol@@ ines found within that li@@ ana are M@@ A@@ O in@@ hi@@ b@@ it@@ ors of the preci@@ se sort necess@@ ary to pot@@ enti@@ ate the tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ am@@ ine . So you ask yourself a question . How , in a fl@@ ora of 8@@ 0,000 species of v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar plants , do these people find these two mor@@ ph@@ olog@@ ically un@@ rel@@ ated plants that when combin@@ ed in this way , created a kind of bio@@ chem@@ ical version of the whole being gre@@ ater than the su@@ m of the parts ?
Well , we use that great e@@ u@@ ph@@ em@@ ism , &quot; tri@@ al and err@@ or , &quot; which is ex@@ posed to be mean@@ ing@@ less .
But you ask the Indi@@ ans , and they say , &quot; The plants talk to us . &quot;
Well , what does that mean ?
This tri@@ be , the C@@ of@@ an , has 1@@ 7 vari@@ eti@@ es of ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , all of which they dist@@ ingu@@ ish a great dist@@ ance in the for@@ est , all of which are re@@ fer@@ able to our ey@@ e as one species .
And then you ask them how they est@@ ab@@ lis@@ h their ta@@ x@@ onom@@ y and they say , &quot; I thought you knew something about plants . I mean , don &apos;t you know anything ? &quot; And I said , &quot; No . &quot;
Well , it turns out you take each of the 1@@ 7 vari@@ eti@@ es in the night of a full mo@@ on , and it s@@ ings to you in a different key .
Now , that &apos;s not going to get you a Ph@@ .@@ D@@ . at Har@@ v@@ ard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than coun@@ ting st@@ am@@ ens .
Now -- -- the problem -- the problem is that even those of us sym@@ pa@@ the@@ tic with the p@@ light of indi@@ gen@@ ous people view them as qu@@ ain@@ t and col@@ or@@ ful but some@@ how re@@ duc@@ ed to the mar@@ g@@ ins of history as the real world , mean@@ ing our world , mov@@ es on .
Well , the truth is the 20@@ th century , 300 years from now , is not going to be remem@@ ber@@ ed for its war@@ s or its technolog@@ ical innov@@ ations , but rather as the era in which we st@@ ood by and either ac@@ ti@@ vely end@@ or@@ s@@ ed or pas@@ si@@ vely acc@@ ep@@ ted the mas@@ sive des@@ truc@@ tion of both biolog@@ ical and cultur@@ al divers@@ ity on the planet . Now , the problem isn &apos;t change .
All cul@@ tures through all time have con@@ st@@ antly been eng@@ aged in a d@@ ance with new possi@@ bil@@ ities of life .
And the problem is not technology itself .
The Si@@ ou@@ x Indi@@ ans did not stop being Si@@ ou@@ x when they gave up the b@@ ow and ar@@ row any more than an American st@@ op@@ ped being an American when he gave up the hor@@ se and bu@@ gg@@ y .
It &apos;s not change or technology that thre@@ at@@ ens the integr@@ ity of the eth@@ n@@ osp@@ here . It is power ,
the cru@@ de face of domin@@ ation .
Wh@@ er@@ ever you look around the world , you disc@@ over that these are not cul@@ tures des@@ tin@@ ed to f@@ ade away ;
these are dy@@ nam@@ ic living pe@@ op@@ les being driv@@ en out of exist@@ ence by identi@@ fi@@ able for@@ ces that are beyond their capac@@ ity to ad@@ ap@@ t to :
whether it &apos;s the e@@ gre@@ gi@@ ous de@@ for@@ est@@ ation in the hom@@ el@@ and of the Pen@@ an --
a n@@ om@@ a@@ di@@ c people from S@@ ou@@ the@@ ast Asia , from Sar@@ aw@@ ak -- a people who lived free in the for@@ est until a generation ago , and now have all been re@@ duc@@ ed to serv@@ itu@@ de and pros@@ tit@@ ution on the ban@@ ks of the ri@@ ver@@ s , where you can see the riv@@ er itself is so@@ il@@ ed with the sil@@ t that seems to be car@@ r@@ ying half of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o away to the South China S@@ ea , where the Jap@@ an@@ ese fre@@ igh@@ ters h@@ ang light in the h@@ ori@@ z@@ on
ready to f@@ ill their hol@@ ds with ra@@ w log@@ s ri@@ p@@ ped from the for@@ est --
or , in the case of the Y@@ an@@ om@@ ami , it &apos;s the disease ent@@ ities that have come in , in the wa@@ ke of the discover@@ y of g@@ old .
Or if we go into the moun@@ ta@@ ins of Ti@@ be@@ t , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research recently , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s a cru@@ de face of political domin@@ ation .
You know , gen@@ oci@@ de , the physical ext@@ inc@@ tion of a people is univers@@ ally con@@ dem@@ ned , but eth@@ no@@ ci@@ de , the des@@ truc@@ tion of people &apos;s way of life , is not only not con@@ dem@@ ned , it &apos;s univers@@ ally , in many quar@@ ters , celebr@@ ated as part of a development str@@ at@@ eg@@ y .
And you cannot understand the p@@ ain of Ti@@ be@@ t until you move through it at the ground level .
I once trav@@ ell@@ ed 6@@ ,000 miles from Ch@@ eng@@ d@@ u in W@@ ester@@ n China over@@ land through s@@ ou@@ the@@ ast@@ er@@ n Ti@@ be@@ t to L@@ h@@ as@@ a with a young colle@@ ag@@ ue , and it was only when I got to L@@ h@@ as@@ a that I underst@@ ood the face behind the statist@@ ics you hear about :
6@@ ,000 sac@@ red mon@@ um@@ ents tor@@ n ap@@ art to d@@ ust and ash@@ es ,
1@@ .@@ 2 million people kill@@ ed by the cad@@ res during the C@@ ul@@ tur@@ al R@@ evolution .
This young man &apos;s father had been as@@ cri@@ bed to the P@@ an@@ ch@@ en L@@ ama .
That me@@ ant he was inst@@ antly kill@@ ed at the time of the Ch@@ inese inv@@ a@@ sion .
H@@ is un@@ cle fl@@ ed with H@@ is H@@ ol@@ iness in the Di@@ as@@ por@@ a that took the people to Ne@@ p@@ al .
H@@ is mother was in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated for the cri@@ me of being we@@ al@@ thy .
He was s@@ mu@@ gg@@ led into the j@@ ail at the age of two to hi@@ de ben@@ e@@ ath her sk@@ ir@@ t ta@@ il@@ s because she couldn &apos;t be@@ ar to be without him .
The sist@@ er who had done that br@@ ave de@@ ed was put into an education cam@@ p .
One day she in@@ ad@@ ver@@ t@@ ently ste@@ p@@ ped on an ar@@ m@@ b@@ and of Ma@@ o , and for that trans@@ gr@@ es@@ sion , she was given seven years of hard lab@@ or .
The p@@ ain of Ti@@ be@@ t can be im@@ possible to be@@ ar , but the re@@ dem@@ p@@ tive spiri@@ t of the people is something to be@@ hold .
And in the end , then , it really comes down to a choice :
do we want to live in a mon@@ o@@ ch@@ rom@@ atic world of mon@@ ot@@ ony or do we want to em@@ br@@ ace a pol@@ y@@ ch@@ rom@@ atic world of divers@@ ity ?
Mar@@ gar@@ et Me@@ ad , the great an@@ thr@@ op@@ olog@@ ist , said , before she died , that her gre@@ at@@ est fe@@ ar was that as we dri@@ f@@ ted towards this bl@@ and@@ ly am@@ or@@ ph@@ ous gener@@ ic world view not only would we see the entire ran@@ ge of the human imagin@@ ation re@@ duc@@ ed to a more n@@ ar@@ row mo@@ d@@ ality of thought , but that we would wa@@ ke from a dre@@ am one day having for@@ g@@ ott@@ en there were even other possi@@ bil@@ ities .
And it &apos;s hum@@ bl@@ ing to remember that our species has , perhaps , been around for &#91; 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 &#93; years .
The Ne@@ ol@@ i@@ th@@ ic R@@ evolution -- which gave us agric@@ ul@@ ture , at which time we succ@@ um@@ bed to the cul@@ t of the se@@ ed ; the po@@ e@@ try of the sh@@ am@@ an was dis@@ plac@@ ed by the pr@@ ose of the pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood ; we created hi@@ er@@ arch@@ y speci@@ ali@@ zation sur@@ pl@@ us -- is only 10@@ ,000 years ago .
The moder@@ n industri@@ al world as we know it is bar@@ ely 300 years old .
Now , that sh@@ allow history doesn &apos;t sugg@@ est to me that we have all the ans@@ wers for all of the chall@@ eng@@ es that will con@@ front us in the en@@ su@@ ing mil@@ l@@ enn@@ ia .
When these my@@ ri@@ ad cul@@ tures of the world are asked the mean@@ ing of being human , they respon@@ d with 10@@ ,000 different vo@@ ices .
And it &apos;s within that song that we will all re@@ disc@@ over the possi@@ bility of being what we are : a fully consci@@ ous species , fully aw@@ are of en@@ sur@@ ing that all pe@@ op@@ les and all gar@@ den@@ s find a way to fl@@ ou@@ ris@@ h . And there are great mom@@ ents of op@@ ti@@ mis@@ m .
This is a photograp@@ h I took at the nor@@ ther@@ n ti@@ p of B@@ aff@@ in Is@@ land when I went n@@ ar@@ wh@@ al hun@@ ting with some In@@ u@@ it people , and this man , O@@ l@@ ay@@ u@@ k , told me a mar@@ vel@@ ous story of his grand@@ father .
The C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an government has not always been kind to the In@@ u@@ it people , and during the 19@@ 5@@ 0s , to est@@ ab@@ lis@@ h our s@@ over@@ e@@ ig@@ n@@ ty , we for@@ c@@ ed them into sett@@ lem@@ ents .
This old man &apos;s grand@@ father re@@ f@@ used to go .
The family , f@@ ear@@ ful for his life , took away all of his we@@ ap@@ ons , all of his tools .
Now , you must understand that the In@@ u@@ it did not fe@@ ar the col@@ d ; they took adv@@ ant@@ age of it .
The run@@ ners of their sle@@ ds were origin@@ ally made of fish w@@ rap@@ ped in car@@ i@@ b@@ ou hi@@ de .
So , this man &apos;s grand@@ father was not in@@ ti@@ mi@@ d@@ ated by the Ar@@ c@@ tic night or the b@@ lizz@@ ard that was blo@@ wing .
He simply sli@@ p@@ ped outside , pul@@ led down his se@@ al@@ sk@@ in tr@@ ous@@ ers and de@@ f@@ ec@@ ated into his hand . And as the f@@ eces began to fre@@ e@@ ze , he sh@@ ap@@ ed it into the form of a bl@@ ade .
He put a spr@@ ay of s@@ ali@@ va on the ed@@ ge of the sh@@ it k@@ ni@@ fe and as it finally f@@ ro@@ ze sol@@ id , he b@@ ut@@ ch@@ ered a do@@ g with it .
He s@@ kin@@ ned the do@@ g and improv@@ is@@ ed a har@@ ness , took the ri@@ b@@ c@@ age of the do@@ g and improv@@ is@@ ed a sl@@ ed , har@@ ness@@ ed up an ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent do@@ g , and dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed over the ice flo@@ es , sh@@ it k@@ ni@@ fe in bel@@ t .
Talk about getting by with nothing . And this , in many ways -- -- is a sym@@ bo@@ l of the res@@ ili@@ ence of the In@@ u@@ it people and of all indi@@ gen@@ ous people around the world .
The C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an government in A@@ pr@@ il of 199@@ 9 gave back to tot@@ al control of the In@@ u@@ it an area of land larg@@ er than California and T@@ ex@@ as put together .
It &apos;s our new hom@@ el@@ and . It &apos;s called N@@ un@@ av@@ ut .
It &apos;s an inde@@ pend@@ ent ter@@ rit@@ ory . They control all min@@ er@@ al resources .
A@@ n amazing example of how a n@@ ati@@ on@@ -@@ state can see@@ k res@@ tit@@ ution with its people .
And finally , in the end , I think it &apos;s pretty obvi@@ ous at least to all of all us who &apos;ve trav@@ el@@ ed in these re@@ mot@@ e re@@ ach@@ es of the planet , to realize that they &apos;re not re@@ mot@@ e at all .
They &apos;re hom@@ el@@ ands of somebody .
They re@@ present br@@ an@@ ches of the human imagin@@ ation that go back to the d@@ a@@ wn of time . And for all of us , the dre@@ ams of these children , like the dre@@ ams of our own children , become part of the n@@ a@@ ked ge@@ ograp@@ hy of hope .
So , what we &apos;re trying to do at the National Ge@@ ograp@@ hic , finally , is , we believe that polit@@ ici@@ ans will never ac@@ comp@@ lis@@ h anything .
We think that pol@@ em@@ ics --
-- we think that pol@@ em@@ ics are not per@@ su@@ a@@ sive , but we think that stor@@ y@@ telling can change the world , and so we are probably the best stor@@ y@@ telling institu@@ tion in the world . We get 3@@ 5 million h@@ its on our w@@ eb@@ site every month .
1@@ 5@@ 6 n@@ ations car@@ ry our televi@@ sion chan@@ nel .
Our mag@@ az@@ ines are read by millions .
And what we &apos;re doing is a series of jour@@ ne@@ ys to the eth@@ n@@ osp@@ here where we &apos;re going to take our audience to places of such cultur@@ al won@@ der that they cannot help but come away d@@ azz@@ led by what they have seen , and hop@@ ef@@ ully , ther@@ e@@ fore , em@@ br@@ ace grad@@ ually , one by one , the centr@@ al re@@ vel@@ ation of an@@ thr@@ op@@ ology : that this world des@@ er@@ ves to ex@@ ist in a diverse way , that we can find a way to live in a tru@@ ly m@@ ul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tur@@ al , pl@@ ur@@ al@@ ist@@ ic world
where all of the w@@ is@@ dom of all pe@@ op@@ les can contribu@@ te to our coll@@ ective w@@ ell@@ -@@ being .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m going to talk to you about some stuff that &apos;s in this book of mine that I hope will res@@ on@@ ate with other things you &apos;ve already heard , and I &apos;ll try to make some connec@@ tions myself , in case you mis@@ s@@ ed them .
But I want to start with what I call the &quot; off@@ ici@@ al d@@ og@@ ma . &quot;
The off@@ ici@@ al d@@ og@@ ma of what ?
The off@@ ici@@ al d@@ og@@ ma of all W@@ ester@@ n industri@@ al soci@@ eti@@ es . And the off@@ ici@@ al d@@ og@@ ma run@@ s like this : if we are interested in ma@@ x@@ im@@ i@@ zing the w@@ el@@ fare of our c@@ iti@@ z@@ ens , the way to do that is to ma@@ x@@ im@@ i@@ ze individual fre@@ e@@ dom .
The reason for this is both that fre@@ e@@ dom is in and of itself good , val@@ u@@ able , wor@@ th@@ while , ess@@ ential to being human .
And because if people have fre@@ e@@ dom , then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will ma@@ x@@ im@@ i@@ ze our w@@ el@@ fare , and no one has to deci@@ de on our be@@ half .
The way to ma@@ x@@ im@@ i@@ ze fre@@ e@@ dom is to ma@@ x@@ im@@ i@@ ze choice .
The more choice people have , the more fre@@ e@@ dom they have , and the more fre@@ e@@ dom they have , the more w@@ el@@ fare they have .
This , I think , is so de@@ ep@@ ly em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in the water sup@@ ply that it wouldn &apos;t occu@@ r to anyone to question it .
And it &apos;s also de@@ ep@@ ly em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in our lives .
I &apos;ll give you some examples of what moder@@ n progres@@ s has made possible for us .
This is my super@@ market . Not such a big one .
I want to say just a word about sal@@ ad dr@@ ess@@ ing .
1@@ 7@@ 5 sal@@ ad dr@@ ess@@ ings in my super@@ market , if you don &apos;t coun@@ t the 10 extra@@ -@@ vir@@ g@@ in ol@@ i@@ ve o@@ il@@ s and 12 bal@@ s@@ am@@ ic v@@ in@@ eg@@ ars you could buy to make a very large number of your own sal@@ ad dr@@ ess@@ ings , in the off@@ -@@ chance that n@@ one of the 1@@ 7@@ 5 the st@@ ore has on off@@ er su@@ it you .
So this is what the super@@ market is like .
And then you go to the consum@@ er electr@@ on@@ ics st@@ ore to set up a ster@@ eo system -- spe@@ ak@@ ers , C@@ D play@@ er , t@@ ape play@@ er , t@@ un@@ er , amp@@ li@@ fi@@ er --
and in this one single consum@@ er electr@@ on@@ ics st@@ ore , there are that many ster@@ eo systems .
We can construc@@ t si@@ x@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a-@@ hal@@ f-@@ million different ster@@ eo systems out of the compon@@ ents that are on off@@ er in one st@@ ore .
You &apos;ve got to ad@@ m@@ it that &apos;s a lot of choice .
In other dom@@ ains -- the world of communic@@ ations .
There was a time , when I was a bo@@ y , when you could get any kind of tele@@ phone serv@@ ice you wanted , as long as it came from Ma B@@ ell .
You r@@ ent@@ ed your phone . You didn &apos;t buy it .
One con@@ sequ@@ ence of that , by the way , is that the phone never bro@@ ke .
And those days are gone .
We now have an almost un@@ lim@@ ited vari@@ ety of ph@@ ones , espe@@ cially in the world of cell ph@@ ones .
These are cell ph@@ ones of the future .
My favor@@ ite is the middle one -- the M@@ P@@ 3 play@@ er , n@@ ose h@@ air tr@@ im@@ mer , and cr@@ è@@ me br@@ û@@ l@@ é@@ e tor@@ ch .
And if by some chance you haven &apos;t seen that in your st@@ ore yet , you can rest as@@ su@@ red that one day soon , you will .
And what this does is it lead@@ s people to walk into their stor@@ es asking this question . And do you know what the answer to this question now is ? The answer is &quot; no . &quot;
It is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
So , in other asp@@ ects of life that are much more signific@@ ant than bu@@ ying things , the same expl@@ os@@ ion of choice is true .
H@@ e@@ al@@ th care . It is no longer the case in the United States that you go to the doc@@ tor , and the doc@@ tor tel@@ ls you what to do .
In@@ ste@@ ad , you go to the doc@@ tor , and the doc@@ tor tel@@ ls you , &quot; Well , we could do A , or we could do B@@ . A has these benef@@ its , and these ris@@ ks . B has these benef@@ its , and these ris@@ ks . What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; D@@ o@@ c , what should I do ? &quot;
And the do@@ c says , &quot; A has these benef@@ its and ris@@ ks , and B has these benef@@ its and ris@@ ks .
What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; If you were me , D@@ o@@ c , what would you do ? &quot;
And the do@@ c says , &quot; But I &apos;m not you . &quot;
And the result is -- we call it &quot; patient aut@@ onom@@ y , &quot; which makes it sound like a good thing ,
but it really is a shi@@ f@@ ting of the bur@@ den and the responsi@@ bility for deci@@ sion@@ -@@ making from somebody who knows something -- nam@@ ely , the doc@@ tor -- to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sic@@ k and th@@ us not in the best shape to be making deci@@ sions -- nam@@ ely , the patient .
There &apos;s enorm@@ ous mark@@ eting of pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tion dru@@ gs to people like you and me , which , if you think about it , makes no sense at all , since we can &apos;t buy them .
Why do they market to us if we can &apos;t buy them ?
The answer is that they exp@@ ect us to call our doc@@ tors the next morning and ask for our pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tions to be changed .
Some@@ thing as d@@ ram@@ atic as our ident@@ ity has now become a matter of choice , as this slide is me@@ ant to indic@@ ate . We don &apos;t in@@ her@@ it an ident@@ ity ; we get to inv@@ ent it .
And we get to re@@ -@@ inv@@ ent ourselves as often as we like .
And that means that every day , when you wa@@ ke up in the morning , you have to deci@@ de what kind of person you want to be .
W@@ ith res@@ p@@ ect to mar@@ ri@@ age and family , there was a time when the de@@ fa@@ ult assum@@ p@@ tion that almost everyone had is that you got mar@@ ried as soon as you could , and then you started having kids as soon as you could .
The only real choice was who , not when , and not what you did after .
N@@ ow@@ ad@@ ays , everything is very much up for gr@@ ab@@ s .
I teach wonder@@ fully intelli@@ g@@ ent students , and I as@@ sig@@ n 20 percent less work than I used to .
And it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smar@@ t , and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less di@@ li@@ g@@ ent .
It &apos;s because they are pre@@ occu@@ pi@@ ed , asking themselves , &quot; Sh@@ ould I get mar@@ ried or not ? Sh@@ ould I get mar@@ ried now ?
Sh@@ ould I get mar@@ ried later ? Sh@@ ould I have kids first , or a car@@ e@@ er first ? &quot;
All of these are consum@@ ing questions .
And they &apos;re going to answer these questions , whether or not it means not doing all the work I as@@ sig@@ n and not getting a good gr@@ ade in my cour@@ ses .
And inde@@ ed they should . These are important questions to answer .
Wor@@ k -- we are bl@@ ess@@ ed , as Car@@ l was poin@@ ting out , with the technology that en@@ ab@@ les us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet -- exc@@ ept the R@@ and@@ ol@@ p@@ h H@@ ot@@ el .
There is one cor@@ ner , by the way , that I &apos;m not going to tell anybody about , where the Wi@@ F@@ i actually works .
I &apos;m not telling you about it because I want to use it .
So what this means , this incredible fre@@ e@@ dom of choice we have with res@@ p@@ ect to work , is that we have to make a deci@@ sion , again and again and again , about whether we should or sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be working .
We can go to watch our kid play s@@ oc@@ cer , and we have our cell phone on one hi@@ p , and our B@@ l@@ ack@@ ber@@ ry on our other hi@@ p , and our lap@@ top , pres@@ um@@ ably , on our lap@@ s .
And even if they &apos;re all sh@@ ut off , every minute that we &apos;re wat@@ ching our kid mu@@ ti@@ late a s@@ oc@@ cer game , we are also asking ourselves , &quot; Sh@@ ould I answer this cell phone call ?
Sh@@ ould I respon@@ d to this em@@ ail ? Sh@@ ould I dra@@ ft this l@@ etter ? &quot;
And even if the answer to the question is &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to make the experience of your kid &apos;s s@@ oc@@ cer game very different than it would &apos;ve been .
So every@@ where we look , big things and small things , material things and li@@ f@@ est@@ y@@ le things , life is a matter of choice .
And the world we used to live in looked like this . &#91; Well , actually , they are wr@@ itt@@ en in st@@ one . &#93; That is to say , there were some cho@@ ices , but not everything was a matter of choice .
And the world we now live in looks like this . &#91; The T@@ en Com@@ mand@@ ments D@@ Y@@ I K@@ it &#93; And the question is , is this good news , or bad news ?
And the answer is , &quot; yes . &quot;
We all know what &apos;s good about it , so I &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it .
All of this choice has two eff@@ ects , two neg@@ ative eff@@ ects on people .
One effect , par@@ ad@@ ox@@ ically , is that it produc@@ es par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is , rather than liber@@ ation .
W@@ ith so many op@@ tions to cho@@ ose from , people find it very difficult to cho@@ ose at all .
I &apos;ll give you one very d@@ ram@@ atic example of this : a study that was done of invest@@ ments in vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment pl@@ ans .
A colle@@ ag@@ ue of mine got access to invest@@ ment recor@@ ds from V@@ an@@ guar@@ d , the gi@@ gan@@ tic mut@@ u@@ al@@ -@@ fun@@ d company of about a million em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es and about 2@@ ,000 different wor@@ k@@ places .
And what she found is that for every 10 mut@@ ual fun@@ ds the em@@ plo@@ y@@ er off@@ ered , rate of partic@@ ip@@ ation went down two percent .
You off@@ er 50 fun@@ ds -- 10 percent fe@@ wer em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es partic@@ ip@@ ate than if you only off@@ er five . Why ?
Because with 50 fun@@ ds to cho@@ ose from , it &apos;s so d@@ am@@ n hard to deci@@ de which fun@@ d to cho@@ ose , that you &apos;ll just put it off until tom@@ or@@ row .
And then tom@@ or@@ row , and tom@@ or@@ row , and tom@@ or@@ row , and of course tom@@ or@@ row never comes .
Un@@ der@@ stand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat do@@ g food when they re@@ ti@@ re because they don &apos;t have enough money put away , it also means that making the deci@@ sion is so hard that they pas@@ s up signific@@ ant mat@@ ching money from the em@@ plo@@ y@@ er .
By not partic@@ ip@@ ating , they are pass@@ ing up as much as 5@@ ,000 dollars a year from the em@@ plo@@ y@@ er , who would hap@@ pi@@ ly mat@@ ch their contribu@@ tion .
So par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is is a con@@ sequ@@ ence of having too many cho@@ ices .
And I think it makes the world look like this .
&#91; And l@@ ast@@ ly , for all et@@ er@@ n@@ ity , F@@ ren@@ ch , b@@ le@@ u che@@ ese , or ran@@ ch ? &#93;
You really want to get the deci@@ sion right if it &apos;s for all et@@ er@@ n@@ ity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to pic@@ k the wrong mut@@ ual fun@@ d , or the wrong sal@@ ad dr@@ ess@@ ing .
So that &apos;s one effect . The second effect is that even if we man@@ age to over@@ come the par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is and make a choice , we end up less s@@ ati@@ sfi@@ ed with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fe@@ wer op@@ tions to cho@@ ose from .
And there are several reasons for this .
One of them is that with a lot of different sal@@ ad dr@@ ess@@ ings to cho@@ ose from , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what sal@@ ad dr@@ ess@@ ing is ? -- it &apos;s easy to imagine you could have made a different choice that would have been better . And what happens is this imagin@@ ed altern@@ ative ind@@ uc@@ es you to re@@ gre@@ t the deci@@ sion you made , and this re@@ gre@@ t sub@@ trac@@ ts from the s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion you get out of the deci@@ sion you made ,
even if it was a good deci@@ sion .
The more op@@ tions there are , the easi@@ er it is to re@@ gre@@ t anything at all that is dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting about the op@@ tion that you ch@@ ose .
Secon@@ d , what econom@@ ists call &quot; opportunity cos@@ ts . &quot;
D@@ an G@@ il@@ ber@@ t made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things de@@ pen@@ ds on what we comp@@ are them to .
Well , when there are lots of altern@@ ati@@ ves to consi@@ der , it is easy to imagine the attr@@ active fe@@ atures of altern@@ ati@@ ves that you re@@ ject that make you less s@@ ati@@ sfi@@ ed with the altern@@ ative that you &apos;ve ch@@ os@@ en .
Here &apos;s an example . &#91; I can &apos;t stop thinking about those other available par@@ king sp@@ ac@@ es on W 8@@ 5@@ th stre@@ et &#93; S@@ or@@ ry if you &apos;re not New Yor@@ kers .
Here &apos;s what you &apos;re sup@@ posed to be thinking .
Here &apos;s this couple on the H@@ amp@@ t@@ ons .
V@@ ery ex@@ pen@@ sive real est@@ ate .
G@@ or@@ ge@@ ous be@@ ach . Be@@ auti@@ ful day . They have it all to themselves .
What could be better ? &quot; Well , d@@ am@@ n it , &quot; this guy is thinking ,
&quot; It &apos;s Au@@ g@@ ust . Every@@ body in my Man@@ h@@ att@@ an neigh@@ bor@@ hood is away .
I could be par@@ king right in front of my building . &quot;
And he spen@@ ds two weeks n@@ ag@@ g@@ ed by the idea that he is mis@@ sing the opportunity , day after day , to have a great par@@ king space .
O@@ p@@ port@@ un@@ ity cos@@ ts sub@@ tr@@ act from the s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion we get out of what we cho@@ ose , even when what we cho@@ ose is terri@@ fic .
And the more op@@ tions there are to consi@@ der , the more attr@@ active fe@@ atures of these op@@ tions are going to be re@@ fl@@ ected by us as opportunity cos@@ ts .
Here &apos;s another example .
Now this car@@ to@@ on makes a lot of poin@@ ts .
It makes poin@@ ts about living in the moment as well , and probably about doing things s@@ low@@ ly .
But one point it makes is that wh@@ en@@ ever you &apos;re cho@@ os@@ ing one thing , you &apos;re cho@@ os@@ ing not to do other things
that may have lots of attr@@ active fe@@ atures , and it &apos;s going to make what you &apos;re doing less attr@@ active .
Th@@ ird : es@@ cal@@ ation of exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations .
This h@@ it me when I went to re@@ place my j@@ e@@ ans .
I we@@ ar j@@ e@@ ans almost all the time .
There was a time when j@@ e@@ ans came in one f@@ lav@@ or , and you b@@ ought them , and they f@@ it like cra@@ p , they were incredibly un@@ com@@ fort@@ able , if you w@@ ore them and was@@ h@@ ed them enough times , they started to feel OK .
I went to re@@ place my j@@ e@@ ans after years of w@@ ear@@ ing these old ones , and I said , &quot; I want a p@@ air of j@@ e@@ ans . Here &apos;s my size . &quot;
And the sh@@ op@@ ke@@ e@@ per said , &quot; Do you want sli@@ m f@@ it , easy f@@ it , rel@@ ax@@ ed f@@ it ?
You want b@@ utt@@ on fly or zi@@ p@@ per fly ? You want st@@ on@@ e@@ was@@ h@@ ed or ac@@ id@@ -@@ was@@ h@@ ed ?
Do you want them distr@@ ess@@ ed ?
You want boo@@ t cut , t@@ aper@@ ed , bl@@ ah bl@@ ah . &quot; On and on he went .
My j@@ a@@ w dr@@ op@@ ped . And after I rec@@ over@@ ed , I said , &quot; I want the kind that used to be the only kind . &quot; He had no idea what that was , so I spent an hour trying on all these d@@ am@@ n j@@ e@@ ans , and I wal@@ ked out of the st@@ ore -- truth ! -- with the b@@ est@@ -@@ f@@ itting j@@ e@@ ans I had ever had .
I did better . All this choice made it possible for me to do better .
But -- I felt wor@@ se .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself .
The reason -- The reason I felt wor@@ se is that , with all of these op@@ tions available , my exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations about how good a p@@ air of j@@ e@@ ans should be went up .
I had very low , no particular exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations when they only came in one f@@ lav@@ or . When they came in 100 f@@ lavor@@ s , d@@ am@@ n it , one of them should &apos;ve been perfect .
And what I got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
And so I compar@@ ed what I got to what I exp@@ ected , and what I got was dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting in compar@@ is@@ on to what I exp@@ ected .
Ad@@ ding op@@ tions to people &apos;s lives can &apos;t help but incre@@ ase the exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations people have about how good those op@@ tions will be .
And what that &apos;s going to produce is less s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion with res@@ ul@@ ts , even when they &apos;re good res@@ ul@@ ts .
No@@ body in the world of mark@@ eting knows this .
&#91; It all looks so great . I can &apos;t wa@@ it to be dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted . &#93; Because if they did , you wouldn &apos;t all know what this was about .
The truth is more like this .
&#91; Every@@ thing was better back when everything was wor@@ se &#93; The reason that everything was better back when everything was wor@@ se is that when everything was wor@@ se , it was actually possible for people to have experi@@ ences that were a pl@@ eas@@ ant sur@@ pri@@ se .
N@@ ow@@ ad@@ ays , the world we live in -- we aff@@ lu@@ ent , industri@@ ali@@ zed c@@ iti@@ z@@ ens , with perf@@ ection the exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ation -- the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you exp@@ ect it to be .
You will never be pl@@ eas@@ antly surpris@@ ed because your exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations , my exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations , have gone through the ro@@ of .
The sec@@ re@@ t to happiness -- this is what you all came for -- the sec@@ re@@ t to happiness is low exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations . I want to say --
just a little aut@@ obi@@ ograp@@ h@@ ical moment -- that I actually am mar@@ ried to a wi@@ fe , and she &apos;s really quite wonderful .
I couldn &apos;t have done better .
I didn &apos;t sett@@ le . But sett@@ ling isn &apos;t always such a bad thing .
Fin@@ ally -- One con@@ sequ@@ ence of bu@@ ying a b@@ ad@@ -@@ f@@ itting p@@ air of j@@ e@@ ans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dis@@ s@@ ati@@ sfi@@ ed , and you ask why ,
who &apos;s responsi@@ ble , the answer is clear : the world is responsi@@ ble .
What could you do ?
When there are hundreds of different st@@ y@@ les of j@@ e@@ ans available , and you buy one that is dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting , and you ask why , who &apos;s responsi@@ ble ? It is equ@@ ally clear that the answer to the question is &quot; you . &quot;
You could have done better .
W@@ ith a hundre@@ d different kinds of j@@ e@@ ans on dis@@ play , there is no exc@@ use for fail@@ ure .
And so when people make deci@@ sions , and even though the res@@ ul@@ ts of the deci@@ sions are good , they feel dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted about them ; they bl@@ ame themselves .
C@@ lin@@ ical de@@ pres@@ sion has expl@@ o@@ ded in the industri@@ al world in the last generation .
I believe a signific@@ ant -- not the only , but a signific@@ ant -- con@@ trib@@ ut@@ or to this expl@@ os@@ ion of de@@ pres@@ sion , and also su@@ ici@@ de , is that people have experi@@ ences that are dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting because their stand@@ ar@@ ds are so high ,
and then when they have to explain these experi@@ ences to themselves , they think they &apos;re at fa@@ ult .
And so the net result is that we do better in gener@@ al , ob@@ j@@ ec@@ ti@@ vely , and we feel wor@@ se .
So let me re@@ mind you .
This is the off@@ ici@@ al d@@ og@@ ma , the one that we all take to be true , and it &apos;s all fal@@ se . It is not true .
There &apos;s no question that some choice is better than n@@ one , but it doesn &apos;t fol@@ low from that that more choice is better than some choice .
There &apos;s some mag@@ ical amount . I don &apos;t know what it is .
I &apos;m pretty con@@ fi@@ d@@ ent that we have long since pass@@ ed the point where op@@ tions im@@ prove our w@@ el@@ fare .
Now , as a polic@@ y matter -- I &apos;m almost done -- as a polic@@ y matter , the thing to think about is this :
what en@@ ab@@ les all of this choice in industri@@ al soci@@ eti@@ es is material aff@@ lu@@ ence .
There are lots of places in the world , and we have heard about several of them , where their problem is not that they have too much choice .
Th@@ e@@ ir problem is that they have too little .
So the stuff I &apos;m talking about is the p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar problem of moder@@ n , aff@@ lu@@ ent , W@@ ester@@ n soci@@ eti@@ es .
And what is so fr@@ ustr@@ ating and in@@ fu@@ ri@@ ating is this : St@@ eve L@@ evit@@ t talked to you y@@ ester@@ day about how these ex@@ pen@@ sive and diffic@@ ul@@ t-@@ to@@ -@@ inst@@ all child se@@ ats don &apos;t help .
What I &apos;m telling you is that these ex@@ pen@@ sive , complic@@ ated cho@@ ices -- it &apos;s not simply that they don &apos;t help .
They actually h@@ ur@@ t .
They actually make us wor@@ se off .
If some of what en@@ ab@@ les people in our soci@@ eti@@ es to make all of the cho@@ ices we make were shi@@ f@@ ted to soci@@ eti@@ es in which people have too few op@@ tions , not only would those people &apos;s lives be improv@@ ed , but ours would be improv@@ ed also ,
which is what econom@@ ists call a &quot; Par@@ et@@ o-@@ improv@@ ing move . &quot;
In@@ come re@@ distribu@@ tion will make everyone better off -- not just poor people -- because of how all this exc@@ ess choice pl@@ ag@@ ues us .
So to conclu@@ de . &#91; You can be anything you want to be -- no lim@@ its &#93;
You &apos;re sup@@ posed to read this car@@ to@@ on , and , being a s@@ op@@ hist@@ ic@@ ated person , say , &quot; A@@ h ! What does this fish know ?
You know , nothing is possible in this fi@@ sh@@ bo@@ w@@ l . &quot;
Im@@ pover@@ i@@ shed imagin@@ ation , a my@@ o@@ pi@@ c view of the world --
and that &apos;s the way I read it at first .
The more I thought about it , h@@ ow@@ ever , the more I came to the view that this fish knows something .
Because the truth of the matter is that if you sh@@ att@@ er the fi@@ sh@@ bo@@ w@@ l so that everything is possible , you don &apos;t have fre@@ e@@ dom . You have par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is .
If you sh@@ att@@ er this fi@@ sh@@ bo@@ w@@ l so that everything is possible , you de@@ cre@@ ase s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion .
You incre@@ ase par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is , and you de@@ cre@@ ase s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion .
Every@@ body needs a fi@@ sh@@ bo@@ w@@ l .
This one is almost certainly too lim@@ ited -- perhaps even for the fish , certainly for us .
But the ab@@ sen@@ ce of some met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical fi@@ sh@@ bo@@ w@@ l is a re@@ ci@@ pe for mi@@ ser@@ y , and , I sus@@ p@@ ect , dis@@ aster .
Thank you very much .
