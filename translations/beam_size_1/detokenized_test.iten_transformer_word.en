<unk> years ago, at TED, <unk> <unk> <unk> a challenge of <unk> called the challenge.
And the idea is very simple.
<unk> of four people have to build the <unk> <unk> possible that <unk> <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk> and a <unk>.
<unk> has to be <unk> up at the top of the <unk>.
And, even though it looks very simple, because it's pretty hard, because you <unk> people to <unk> very quickly.
So I thought it was an interesting idea, and I <unk> it into a lab on the <unk>.
And it was a huge success.
And since then, I've <unk> about 70 <unk> of this kind of <unk> around the world with students, designers and <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
There's something in this <unk> that <unk> <unk> important <unk> on the nature of <unk>, and I would like to share some of these <unk> with you.
<unk>, most people are starting with the <unk> to the task from <unk>.
They talk about it, they're going to <unk> that might be <unk> for power, and then I'm going to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, <unk>.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
<unk> most of the time, <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> structures and, at the end, when the time is about to <unk>, somebody <unk> out the <unk>, and they <unk> it up on top, <unk> a <unk> back and <unk>!
<unk> the job.
But what happens is, most of the time is that the <unk> is that the <unk> <unk> <unk>, because the weight of the <unk> is <unk> and <unk> the whole structure.
There's a number of people who have many more moments moments moments than others, and between <unk>, there are <unk> business <unk>.
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and they <unk> structures <unk>.
And there are <unk> that have a lot of more <unk> structures "<unk>," and, the best, there are <unk> schools.
And it's amazing.
As <unk> says, not only create the most <unk> structures, but they are also the most interesting structures of them.
And your question is, how is it possible? Why is it?
And I could say, "<unk> <unk> kids to <unk> the <unk> <unk>." <unk>.
We don't spend time <unk> for power.
But there's another reason.
And the reason is that the students of economy are used to find the single best project.
And then it <unk>.
And after, what happens is that when you <unk> the <unk> up, they don't have more time, and what happens?
The crisis.
<unk> you <unk>? Right.
What kids do <unk> is that they <unk> from <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, one, <unk> <unk>, after the other, <unk> <unk> <unk>, and so different possibilities of <unk> <unk> <unk> along the <unk>.
<unk> designers who are <unk> that this kind of <unk> is the <unk> of <unk>.
And with every version, the children have a <unk> <unk> on what works and what doesn't work.
So the ability to work on <unk> is <unk>, but we see how different <unk> <unk>.
The average of most people are about 50 <unk>, for the students, about half, <unk>, a little bit better, but not very, very little bit better, but not much better than many adults.
Who does better than everybody?
<unk> and engineers, <unk> to the sky.
<unk> <unk> is the <unk> structure I've ever seen.
And why? Because I think that <unk> and <unk> models are the key to build <unk> <unk>.
Then we have the <unk> <unk>, a little bit better than the media.
But that's where it becomes interesting.
If you <unk> a <unk> <unk>, the group can do much better.
It's amazing. You go a little bit, you <unk> "<unk> that that group <unk>." Can you understand them. "
Because they have <unk> <unk> in <unk> the <unk> job.
<unk> the process, <unk> it.
And all the <unk> that <unk> and <unk> attention to work <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>, and their <unk> <unk> to a safe success.
If you have 10 groups that usually work well, you may have six that <unk> structures that are <unk> that are <unk> structures that are <unk>.
And I <unk> an interesting experiment.
I thought, <unk> <unk> for once.
I put on the <unk> <unk> dollars on software team.
What do you think that's success to the design students?
What was the result?
That's what happened.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
If one of them had built a <unk> <unk> <unk>, would take home.
<unk> 't that a <unk> <unk> has a very strong <unk>?
We <unk> again the <unk> with the same students.
What do you think of that happened?
They had a <unk> value of a <unk>.
The same team, from <unk> has become the best.
They've created the <unk> structure in time.
So they're <unk> <unk> on the nature of <unk> and <unk> success, then they're <unk>: why would somebody to spend time writing a challenge?
The reason is this: help of creating <unk> and <unk> <unk> to help groups build, <unk> and <unk>.
And what a <unk> is <unk> to help <unk> <unk>.
Because, <unk>, every project has his <unk>, isn't it like this?
The challenge is to <unk> an <unk> experience, a common <unk> position to build a <unk>.
And so, this is the value of this simple <unk>.
And those of you who were interested in, can go to <unk>
It's a <unk> where you can take a look at how to build the <unk>.
There are <unk> <unk>.
There are <unk> examples from all over the world on how people <unk> and <unk> the system.
There's also the <unk> of the world.
And the most important lesson, I think, is that design is really a <unk> of contact.
<unk> the <unk> of all the <unk>, and the <unk> of the most <unk> <unk>, the <unk> and the <unk> to <unk> the challenge you.
And sometimes, a little <unk> of this experience is all necessary for a moment, "<unk>" <unk> "at a moment" <unk> "
And all of that can make the difference.
Thank you very much.
<unk> <unk> that we have a car, big, beautiful, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, is a car for time.
Everybody in this room has to <unk>.
You can go back, you can't go back; you can't go back.
And I would <unk> to know what I would say, because I asked my friends for the last few days, and everybody want to go back.
I don't know. You should go back to before you get your car or <unk>, or "<unk> <unk>."
I don't know.
They're <unk> that there's a kind of <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
I <unk> it.
But I don't do part of that group, I have to <unk> it.
I don't want to go back, and not because I'm <unk>, it's because I'm <unk> to this planet not <unk> back, go ahead.
So I want to go into the machine, and I want to go ahead.
This is the best time that there's been on this planet in every field that we can measure health, <unk>, opportunities, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
There's never been a time like this.
My <unk> <unk>, all of the <unk>, all of the time.
My <unk> <unk> that number to 70.
My parents are for 80.
So it's better than there is a <unk> at the beginning of the number of years at my death.
But it's not just about people like us, it's a much bigger thing about this.
A child born in New <unk> today can be a living as the most <unk> man in the world of 100 years ago.
<unk>. It's an amazing fact.
How does it make it look true?
<unk>. <unk> has <unk> billion people on this planet.
He changed the <unk> of <unk> as a <unk> has ever done.
If <unk> is <unk>. <unk>.
We <unk> it. <unk>.
In the world <unk>, disease that <unk> million people only a generation ago, in practice.
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> --
somebody knows what they're?
<unk>, modern medicine, our ability to <unk> billion people, these are <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
And I think, in the scientific <unk>, to try and see things, seeing if they work, it's one of the great results of humanity.
These were the good news.
<unk>, they were good news because there are other problems, and they were <unk> many times, for example, which is that, <unk> everything we've <unk>, a billion people go to bed <unk> on this planet, every day.
This number is <unk>, with incredible <unk>, and it's <unk>.
And not only, we used our creativity to <unk> the planet.
<unk> <unk>, land <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, natural gas: are <unk>, and they're <unk> up quickly, and if we don't <unk> our <unk> to get out of this <unk>, <unk>, even we.
So the question is, can we do that? I think, yes.
I think it's clear that it's possible to produce <unk> billion people with no <unk> the land on which they live.
I think it's possible to <unk> this world of energy without this <unk>.
I think, and not, it's not a <unk> <unk>.
But here's the thing that <unk> me <unk> at night -- one of the things that <unk> me <unk> at night.
We never have had this so we need to <unk> <unk> as we need it now, and we never have been in the position of <unk> to the best of how we might have today.
We're at a <unk> <unk>, in many <unk>.
But <unk> this, I think we should go back and <unk>, 300 years, before the <unk>, to find a time in which we <unk> the <unk>, a time that we have <unk>, and on the <unk>, and the more <unk>, than we do.
People <unk> in what they believe, and they do believe that they do can't <unk>.
<unk> the truth can <unk>.
<unk>, everybody's right to their <unk>; they also have to their own <unk> on the progress, but you know what you don't have?
You don't have to your <unk>. I'm sorry, you can't.
I put it a little bit in <unk>.
A <unk> of years ago I wrote a story about <unk> for "The New <unk>," a little article.
And I was <unk> that somebody <unk>, who was <unk> to what is, after all, the <unk> of health care of all human history.
I didn't know what to do, so I did the story and I was <unk> the story and I went to somebody else.
I wrote a story about <unk> food.
<unk> thing, just bigger.
People were <unk>.
So I wrote a story about that, and I couldn't understand why people <unk> <unk> as "food I'm <unk>, because we thought we would make food molecules <unk>, because we thought that <unk> the molecules <unk>, rather than <unk>, rather than to be <unk>.
But, as I do my job. I wrote the story and I went on.
I mean, I'm a <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, let's go to <unk>, <unk> there.
But these stories <unk> me and I couldn't understand why, but I got it.
The problem was that those <unk> that were <unk> me was <unk> not at all <unk>.
They were <unk> people, <unk>, for good people.
They were just like people in this room.
And the thing that <unk> me --
but I thought, this is: we have to be <unk>; we're at a point on this planet, where we have not have the same relationship with progress that there was a bit.
We're talking about it in a <unk> way.
We're talking in terms of <unk> using <unk>, "<unk>." OK, there are reasons for this, and I think we know what they are.
We have lost in institutions, in <unk>, and sometimes in science, sometimes in science, and it's <unk> that happened.
We have to do some <unk> and people <unk>.
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
I mean, everybody has his list.
We have questions and problems with people who <unk> had always right.
So, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, <unk> answers, <unk>.
It's not going to <unk>.
But here's the fundamental point: when the evidence is necessary, and we're not very <unk> in this.
And I think the reason I think that's a <unk> <unk> that I had never seen and hope I never <unk>.
<unk> 12 years ago, it was <unk> a story, a <unk> story, who <unk> there was a <unk> between an <unk> and <unk> against <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> very <unk>.
<unk> studies were made to see if it was true.
And it's a very important question.
<unk> the data.
<unk> from the United States, from <unk>, from <unk>, <unk>, and everybody was <unk>, no <unk>, no <unk>, no <unk>, no <unk>, no <unk>.
It didn't make it difference. It's because we believe in <unk>, to what we see -- what we think we're seeing -- to what we think we're doing.
We believe that a <unk> <unk> <unk> from the government <unk> that show us, and I think, I think we all love it.
But you know what?
The results were <unk> --
<unk> because there is a fact: the United States is one of the <unk> of the world in which the number of <unk> against the <unk> is <unk>.
It's <unk>, and we should <unk> ourselves.
It's terrible.
What happened that <unk> us to do something like this?
Now, I'm going to do it.
<unk>, do you have a <unk>?
<unk> in the audience has ever seen a person died of <unk>?
It's not going on.
In this country, it doesn't happen, but it happened <unk> times in the world last year.
They're a nice little bit of <unk> for <unk>, 20 every time.
But because it's not the success here, we can <unk> from your head, and people like <unk> <unk> can go around <unk> <unk> and <unk> by <unk> as <unk> or <unk> <unk>.
And they can do it because they don't <unk> the difference between <unk> and <unk>.
We don't know that these two things seem <unk>, but they're not nearly.
But it's something that we need to learn, and we need to <unk> them.
This man was a <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
It <unk> humanity from one of his <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, no <unk> -- the <unk>, <unk> -- <unk>.
The man in the center, not <unk>.
It's called Paul <unk>.
It just created a <unk> against other people.
It <unk> the 400 life of 400, 500 children every year in the developing world.
<unk>, right?
It's <unk>, if it's not that Paul goes around <unk>, he says the <unk>, and that people should simply <unk> <unk>.
And he says it in these terms.
So, Paul is <unk> a <unk>.
When Paul in a public <unk> can't <unk> without a <unk> <unk>.
They call it home because some of the <unk> who know where his children go to school.
Why? Because Paul has created a <unk>.
I couldn't have <unk>, but <unk> are <unk>.
If you try to <unk>, <unk> disease, <unk> disease, and it's going on.
We have the <unk> in this country.
And it's always worse, and it's not much worse, and it's just about numbers.
And I don't just <unk>.
<unk>? <unk> that. Why not?
My <unk> <unk> <unk> me a couple of weeks ago, and she said that I <unk> a little <unk>.
<unk> me said before.
She wouldn't have to <unk> her son against the <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
OK.
Why? Because there is no <unk> to us. But you know what?
We didn't have the <unk> in the United States.
I don't know -- maybe I'll <unk> a guy is <unk> on an <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>, now is up the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> between a couple of hours, <unk> a car, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> to one of these <unk> <unk> <unk> from TED.
He doesn't know he's been <unk> by a <unk> disease, and we don't know that we don't know why the world works the world.
This is the planet that we live in. We don't make <unk> that it's not the case.
We <unk> <unk> <unk>. We want to do it.
<unk> you've got the <unk> <unk>?
<unk>, a little bit of <unk> to start the day.
I know you did because the half of Americans do it every day.
<unk> that stuff, as you go to the <unk> medicine, and it doesn't matter how much they are <unk>.
The data always <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> <unk>. More than that, almost never <unk>.
But it's OK, you want to <unk> <unk> billion dollars to <unk> <unk>, I'm with you.
<unk> <unk>. <unk>.
Why do we do that?
I think, <unk> the big <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the big machine. We don't <unk>.
And we do well. Our <unk> system is <unk>.
It's <unk> to millions.
It's absolutely cold, and it's also cold, even for those of us that can <unk>.
So, we go away, and how do you get?
It's <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's great. We <unk> the great <unk>.
You know, it's a serious problem because this stuff is a <unk>, and we'll spend billions of dollars.
I have a whole series of examples here.
<unk> of these -- <unk>, a <unk>, <unk> -- a <unk>, <unk> -- I don't know what it's but it's going to take billion dollars, and it's a <unk>.
You know what? When I say these things, people <unk> me against, and they say, "But what do you care? <unk> you? <unk> people's <unk> what they want.
It's good. "
<unk> a little bit? You <unk>.
Because I don't care if the <unk> is <unk> for <unk> and <unk> <unk> to say, "<unk>, I don't have <unk> to listen to evidence listen to <unk> <unk> on the <unk>," or if it says a few <unk> cancer.
When the road <unk> to <unk> science and <unk> with <unk> and <unk>, we <unk> in a place where we don't have to be.
<unk> like <unk> <unk> in South Africa.
He's <unk> 400 <unk> of his <unk> <unk> to say that he <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that we know can <unk> the <unk> of AIDS.
<unk> of thousands of <unk> in a country that was <unk> more than any other from this disease.
Please, don't <unk> to <unk> that there are no <unk> for these <unk>.
There are. There are always.
Now, the most <unk> <unk> in which we are in the middle of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of food <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> on the words, on the <unk>.
It's <unk>, it's not science.
Every single thing that <unk>, every <unk> of <unk>, every <unk> of <unk>, every <unk> of <unk>, every <unk> of <unk> has been <unk> by man.
You see, there was no <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>.
There were no <unk>.
There were no <unk> trees.
We did this over the last <unk> years.
<unk> <unk> and something else doesn't.
And we <unk> what we don't understand.
Now we can do it more <unk>.
And there are <unk>, of course, there are.
But we can <unk> things like <unk> A in <unk>, and this <unk> million people, <unk> their lives.
And we don't want to do that?
I have to tell you, I don't <unk> it.
We're <unk> to the <unk>.
Why?
The things that I've always feel <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, we don't want to <unk> <unk> <unk> with the same thing, it's wrong.
We don't want the <unk> companies on life.
We don't want the companies are <unk> <unk>.
You know what my answer to this?
Yes. You're right. You're right. You're going to <unk> something.
It's true, we have a huge problem, but it's not science.
It's got nothing to do with science.
It's law, <unk>, <unk> lines on <unk>.
You know, science is not a <unk>.
It's not a country.
It's not a idea; it's a process.
It's a process, sometimes gives a <unk> <unk> to times, but the idea that we shouldn't be at science of doing his work because we're really <unk>, and it's starting to millions of people of <unk>.
You know, in the next 50 years, you can produce 70 percent of what you're going to find, 70 percent.
These are the <unk> in Africa of the last 30 years.
<unk>. <unk>.
They need us and we don't give them.
Why? <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We don't want to <unk> people to eat <unk> as an example, <unk>.
<unk> billion people <unk>.
<unk> a little bit of a <unk>.
But it's only <unk>. <unk> <unk>.
It doesn't have <unk> <unk>, but the scientists are <unk> the way to <unk> that right now.
So many people could eat and <unk> less the risk of getting <unk>.
You don't know about <unk>, and you know what?
It would be very nice. It would be a <unk> of <unk>, but it would be very nice.
<unk> to <unk> <unk>: Why are we?
I mean, <unk>: why are we <unk> this thing?
<unk> why don't we want to <unk> the genes over there?
It's about <unk> genes. It's not <unk> <unk>.
It's not our <unk> <unk> for <unk>, or our <unk> to get bigger food, better, better, <unk>.
We don't <unk> <unk>.
It's about <unk> the lives, and it would be now that we can understand what that means.
Why -- you want to <unk>? -- if you don't want to <unk> it, and you start <unk> as we're now, we're going to have something that I don't think <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
There's no other way of <unk> what's going on.
It's <unk>, it's <unk>, it's <unk>, and we need to <unk>.
So, after this <unk> conversation, you could say, "You will still go into this <unk> machine of time and going to the future?"
Yeah! I want.
It's <unk> on the present now, but we have an incredible opportunity.
We can <unk> the machine of time as we want.
We have the opportunity to go where we want, and we're going to do it.
We have to do these <unk>, and we need to think about it, but when you go back in the time, and we go ahead and get them happy to do it.
I know that we can and, as far as I think the world needs.
Thank you.
Thank you.
One day, the <unk> of the <unk> Times <unk> <unk> was <unk> for the <unk> <unk> center when I <unk> a music music.
<unk> <unk> by a man, a <unk>, fascinating man, with the <unk> <unk>, without <unk>, who <unk> a <unk> who had two <unk>.
I'm going to tell a story that many of you know, because the <unk> of <unk> <unk> for a book, which, <unk>, was <unk> to the big screen, with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> part of <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> that <unk> was <unk> because of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> was <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> a terrible <unk>, and 30 years later, I'll <unk> it as a <unk> without the streets the streets of <unk> <unk> <unk> in the center of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
You all to read the book <unk>, or to look at the movie to understand not only about the <unk> <unk> that <unk> between these two men,
I call <unk> <unk>. I'm a <unk> <unk>.
I've been <unk> for 10 years, and my <unk> for the next 10 years, to try to save the next 10 years is to try to save the online life.
To do I have a plan, and I <unk> in the <unk> more people, and I <unk> all of you, to spend more time on play and <unk>.
At the time, three billion hours a week <unk>.
Some of you may think, "<unk> a lot of time past."
perhaps too, <unk> how many problems we have to solve in the real world.
In fact, in my research, <unk> the <unk> for <unk>, actually is the opposite.
<unk> billion a week, not <unk> <unk> to solve the <unk> problems in the world.
In fact, I think if we want to survive the next century on this planet, we have to <unk> that <unk>.
I've <unk> that the total we need is for <unk> billion hours every week.
It's probably an idea that a <unk> <unk>, so the <unk>, to <unk> the concept.
If we want to solve problems which <unk>, poverty, the <unk> changes, <unk>, <unk>, I believe that we have the <unk> of playing online play, for at least <unk> billion hours, at least <unk> billion to the <unk>, for the next <unk>. No, they're <unk>, they're <unk>, they're <unk>, really.
That's why. This is a <unk> picture, because I think I'm going to play is so important for the <unk> of human species. <unk>.
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, wanted to <unk> the game.
So it <unk> <unk> as they were <unk>.
And this is a <unk> <unk> of play.
If you're not <unk> <unk>, you can't <unk> some of the <unk> of this picture.
You can probably see the sense of <unk>, a little <unk>, but also, <unk> <unk>, a very <unk> attention to the very <unk> problem.
If you're <unk>, you know, you're <unk> some <unk>, the <unk> around the eyes, and around the mouth is.
And the <unk> <unk> show.
This is a <unk> <unk> at a step from something called a "<unk> <unk>."
<unk>, it's a word that you've heard. OK.
So we have <unk> <unk> between us.
A <unk> <unk> is a result of that <unk> <unk> you don't seem to be until you <unk> it.
It's almost beyond the <unk> of the imagination, and when you <unk> is a <unk>, what you're really good. This is a <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> is a step from a <unk> <unk>.
And this is the <unk> that we need to see on the <unk> of millions of <unk> in the world, and we're going to <unk> the next hundred years. <unk> the <unk> of somebody who, against all <unk>, is <unk> by a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> this is the <unk> that we see in the life of all the day <unk> as we <unk> to deal with <unk> problems.
This is the <unk> I call "<unk>." I'm not <unk>. "And I'm <unk>." And I'm going to <unk>. "
I'm <unk> with <unk>. "I'm not <unk> in the <unk>."
This is a <unk> in my old <unk> neighborhood, in California, where I did the <unk> on the <unk> because we are more <unk> in the game than in real life.
And this is a problem of many <unk> <unk>: <unk> that we're not <unk> as much as in games.
And I don't mean, "just as a success," even though the success is: <unk> in the online <unk>.
But I mean, "<unk>" in the sense of <unk> to do something important, I started <unk> and <unk>.
And when we're in a online, I think a lot of us become the best <unk> of itself, the most able to help them with no <unk>, more able to help them on a problem for all the time, to <unk> after a <unk> and try <unk> <unk>.
And in real life, when you <unk> a <unk>, when you <unk> a <unk>, it often <unk> us, we <unk> <unk>, you know, you <unk> <unk>, maybe <unk>, <unk> or <unk>.
We never <unk> these <unk> as we <unk>, simply don't exist in a game.
So this is what I wanted to study at university.
What is that in a game, we feel that we can't get any <unk>?
How can we <unk> those <unk> from games and <unk> to the real world?
So I've been studying games as a <unk> of <unk>, which is really the environment <unk> to solve problems in a <unk> way.
And I started to notice some things that make the <unk> <unk> so possible in the online <unk>.
The first is that, when you go into one of these <unk> <unk>, especially in <unk> of <unk>, there are different characters different <unk> that come to the point from a mission to <unk> the world. <unk> to <unk> the world.
But not any mission: a perfectly <unk> mission at your current level. Right?
So you can <unk> it.
They never give you a challenge.
But it's <unk> your <unk>. So you have to <unk> <unk>.
But there's no <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>, you don't spend time <unk> <unk>, there's always something important and to do.
And there are also <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, hundreds of thousands of people, <unk> to you to <unk> your <unk> mission.
It's not a very common thing in real life, this feeling that we have <unk> <unk>.
And there's this <unk> <unk>, this <unk> that we're going to go on, because we're there, and what we're doing.
And then I <unk> all this <unk> <unk> --
you've heard about <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> one of intelligence.
We don't <unk> that kind of <unk> <unk> in real life.
When I <unk> this stage, I didn't <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>, and <unk> one in <unk> ideas.
We don't <unk> that kind of <unk> in real life.
Now, the problem of <unk> online as a <unk> of <unk> is that gives so <unk> to be <unk> by a step, and it's going to be <unk> by a moments of all the time in these <unk> <unk>.
It's better than reality.
That's why, <unk>, all the <unk> of <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is not <unk> a <unk> thing.
But in perspective, <unk> million years ago was the time when one of our <unk> <unk> <unk>.
That was the first <unk> to walk <unk>.
Okay, so when we're talking about how long we're going to play the only way we're going to talk about <unk>, is to talk about <unk>, that's a great thing, but also, because we've discovered that we're going to <unk> this time to play, we're <unk> what we're capable of <unk> and <unk>.
This is true, I think.
So let's take this interesting <unk>.
It was <unk> <unk> by a <unk> at the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The young <unk> <unk> today in a country with a strong <unk> culture, will have been <unk> hours <unk> online, will have been <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> hours is a <unk> number interesting number for two reasons.
First of all, for the children in the United States <unk> hours is the number of hours that <unk> to school <unk>, if you're in the <unk>, if you're in the last <unk>, if you're in the last <unk>, if you're in the last <unk>, if you're in the last <unk>, if you're in the United States, it's the number of hours, <unk> is the number of hours, <unk>, <unk>,
So we have a whole bunch of education that young people <unk> as being <unk> <unk> <unk> at the time at school in which we <unk> everything else.
And some of you will probably read the new book by <unk> <unk>, "<unk>."
If you did have read it you that you've read it in its success, the theory of <unk> hours for success.
It's based on a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, which would say that if you spend hours <unk> <unk> <unk> to any <unk> <unk> <unk> in the field.
<unk> <unk> in that something as much as the best people in the world.
So, what we have now is a whole generation of young generation is <unk> genes.
So, the question is, "What do they become <unk>?"
because if we could understand what this is going to be a lot of human resources without <unk>.
This is the number of people in the world who are at least <unk> a day to play online.
These are our genes of the game.
500 million people who are <unk> <unk> -- in something.
And in the next <unk>, we'll have one other billion <unk> <unk> that are <unk> in that something.
If you don't know, you know, this is what we're going to ask: the <unk> industry is <unk> that <unk> energy and work with the network rather than the Internet at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the Internet in India, in particular, China, <unk>, <unk> online.
<unk> is a billion <unk> in the next <unk>.
This is <unk> us to <unk> billion <unk>.
So I started thinking about what these games are <unk> us in genes.
These are four <unk> I <unk>. The first is a <unk> <unk>.
Okay. <unk> like a <unk> form of <unk>.
A <unk> <unk> is the <unk> to act immediately to face a <unk>, with the <unk> of having a <unk> hope of success.
<unk> <unk> believe that a <unk> <unk> is possible and that's worth <unk>, and it's always worth <unk>, and <unk> now.
The <unk> <unk> are not with your hands.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in <unk> a social <unk>.
There are a lot of some interesting research that shows that we find better with other people after having <unk> with them, even though they have <unk>.
And the reason is that it takes a lot of trust to play with somebody: we have trust that time with us, who <unk> with the same rules and <unk> with the same rules and <unk>, and <unk> to the game.
So, <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
We have a lot of social <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk>. <unk>.
You know, there's a reason that the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> hours a week, almost as a <unk> job.
It's because we know, as we're <unk>, that we're <unk>, we're <unk> working, rather than <unk> or <unk>.
We know that we are <unk>, as a human being, to work <unk> to something that has.
And the <unk> <unk> are <unk> to work <unk> <unk>, if you <unk> a <unk> task.
To end, a <unk> meaning.
<unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> to <unk> <unk>, to human stories, on a <unk> scale.
For example, a little information to help create a context.
We all have to <unk>, the biggest <unk> in the world.
The second largest <unk> in the world, with almost <unk> <unk> is the <unk> of <unk> <unk> million people use it every month.
They've <unk> more information about <unk> of <unk> in the Internet, which on any other <unk> in the world.
They're building a <unk> <unk>.
We had a <unk> source of <unk> information <unk>.
OK, these are the four <unk> that together only <unk> one thing.
<unk> <unk> are individuals of great <unk> <unk>.
These are people who believe they are capable of changing the world.
The only problem is that they're capable of changing <unk>, but not the real <unk>.
This is the problem I'm trying to solve.
There's a <unk> named <unk> <unk>.
His studies are <unk>. He's <unk> the reason that people <unk> so much time, energy and money, in the online online.
He said, "We're <unk> what's going to happen less than a mass <unk> into the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>."
And it's a <unk>, so it's <unk>, and it says -- not like me, I'm a <unk> <unk>, I'm <unk> --
But he <unk> -- he <unk> that this is a perfectly <unk> thing, because <unk> can get more in the online <unk> in real life.
We should have more social relationships in a game that's not in real life.
It's a better <unk> and you get more <unk> in a game that doesn't in real life.
So, <unk>, for now, it's perfectly <unk> for the <unk> <unk>, to spend more time in the <unk> <unk> that the real world, I agree with this is <unk>, now but it's not, in any way, a situation. We have a <unk> situation.
Here we have <unk> from something that <unk> <unk> years ago.
These are <unk> <unk>, <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, we had <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>. And these <unk> <unk> are <unk>. And these <unk> <unk> <unk>, and we had these <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, if you <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, you know, you know, if you <unk> <unk> <unk>, you know, you know, if you <unk> <unk> <unk>, you will find this story.
It's the story of the <unk> and why.
<unk> <unk> that games, in particular, the <unk> <unk>, were <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>, during a time of <unk>.
I thought the <unk> was so <unk>, that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> to do something <unk>.
People were <unk>, the population was in <unk>, was a <unk> situation, they needed a <unk> solution.
So, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> for all the <unk>.
One day, everybody would <unk>.
The next day, everybody would <unk>.
And it <unk> so <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>, from the moment that I play is so <unk>, and we <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk>, who <unk> the fact that we have nothing to eat.
And so one day <unk>, and one day <unk>.
And <unk>, we <unk> that 18 years, <unk> to <unk> <unk> a day and <unk> that <unk>.
I think that's exactly the way we use games a day of today.
It's about the games for <unk> to the <unk> of the real world.
It's about the games to <unk> from everything that doesn't work in our real environment, from all that we don't have to <unk> life, and <unk> what we need from games.
But we don't have to <unk> <unk> here.
This is interesting <unk>: <unk>, after 18 years, the <unk> <unk> <unk> that would have <unk> <unk>, so the <unk> that would have <unk> one last <unk> to <unk>.
It <unk> the entire <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> of that <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> and <unk> to find a new land where we could live, <unk> behind the right number of people to survive with the <unk> available resources, with hope to bring their <unk> from some other part, where it could have <unk> from the other side, where it could have <unk>.
It's a little <unk> idea, right?
But, studies on DNA, <unk> on DNA that <unk> that <unk> that would then take the <unk>, <unk> DNA <unk> <unk>.
So, scientists have <unk> that the story of <unk> is a real story.
And <unk> have found <unk> of a global <unk> that <unk> almost 20 years, and that may explain the <unk>.
So this incredible story could be true: they could actually <unk> their culture, <unk> in 18 years, and then be so <unk>, and know how good <unk> are so <unk>, and know how good we are going to be so <unk> in the game, and it's <unk>.
OK, we can do that.
<unk> to <unk> of <unk> from <unk>.
It was the first game of <unk> series of <unk> <unk> of <unk>. This is 16 years ago.
They started <unk> for 18 years, we <unk> to 16 years.
I say, we're <unk> for our <unk> game.
They <unk> half the population on the journey to find a new world.
It's from here that <unk> the idea of <unk> billion hours a week.
<unk> that half of us are <unk> to go to <unk> an hour a day to play, until we <unk> the problems in real world.
What are you for, "How do we <unk> the problems of the real world in a game?" Well, that's what I've <unk> my work on the <unk> years, <unk> <unk> the <unk> for <unk>.
We have <unk> <unk> <unk>, we have this <unk> that we <unk> our idea of how we should <unk> with the future.
We don't want to <unk> the future.
What we want to do is to <unk> the future.
We can imagine the <unk> from the best results and then we want to give people the <unk> of <unk> actually.
You can imagine <unk> <unk> for people to <unk>.
I'm going to show you three games that I've <unk> and that are a <unk> to give people the tools to create <unk> in their future.
This is "<unk> <unk> <unk>."
We did this game in <unk>.
It's an online game in which it's <unk> to survive a <unk> of oil.
<unk> is not real, but we have <unk> <unk> material to make you believe that it is, and to make life live in a real life as if you <unk> it. So, when you <unk> in the game, you <unk>, you <unk> in that area, and we <unk> you in the <unk> area, and data that's not available, on food distribution,
the impact on the <unk>, if there are <unk>, if there are <unk>, and you have to think about how you <unk> your life <unk> if that's real. You have to think about how you're going to get a <unk> about it, of <unk>.
We <unk> this game with <unk> <unk> in <unk>, and we <unk> them from then for the three years, and what I can tell you is that it's an experience that we <unk>.
<unk> wants to change the way they live only because it's a good thing for the world or because it's a <unk> to do it.
But if you <unk> them in a <unk> <unk> and <unk>, "We have no longer.
This is an amazing story. It's a <unk> story that you can <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> you to see how they <unk>. "
Most of our <unk> have <unk> that has learned in the game.
So, for the next game we started to save the world, we decided to save higher the world, to a bigger problem of oil <unk>.
We have a game called <unk>, at <unk> for <unk>, and the <unk> was: a <unk> has <unk> that humanity only have other <unk> years on this planet.
The <unk> <unk> <unk>. "<unk> of <unk> <unk>."
We asked people to <unk> online almost like a <unk> <unk> film.
And we <unk> them the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> a team of dream, and they all have something to do to save the world, and they all have something to do to save the world, but in our game, instead of having only <unk> people in the <unk> team, all of the <unk> team, and the <unk> of the future, the future of the future of <unk>, the future of the future, the future of <unk> and the future, the future of the future, the future, the future, the future of the future of the future, the future of the future of the future, the future, the future of the future of the future of <unk> and the future, the future
<unk> people have <unk> for eight weeks, they have 500 <unk> <unk> solutions that you can find if you go online and <unk> on Google "<unk>."
And finally, the last game, <unk> <unk>. This is a game that is a <unk> <unk>.
If you <unk> the <unk> game from the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, as <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
We're starting with <unk> <unk> for Africa, we're learning to learn the <unk> of social innovation.
There's a story in <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, imagination and <unk>.
I would all like to share this game with young people, everywhere in the world, in particular areas in the developing world, who may <unk> <unk> from <unk> to start thinking about their social <unk> to save the world.
It's now to end.
I want to ask a question.
What do you think?
We have all these incredible <unk>, we have these games that are <unk> projects of what we can do, but nobody of these have still <unk> the real world.
Well, I hope that we can agree with me that <unk> <unk> are a human <unk> that we can use to do in the real world, that the game is a powerful powerful powerful <unk> for change, which we have these incredible <unk>, a social <unk>, this <unk> <unk> and <unk> for a social <unk>, this <unk> and <unk> of an <unk> <unk>.
I hope that we can <unk> meeting to play games that are <unk>, to survive on this planet for another century, and my hope is that I will <unk> you to me in the <unk> and <unk> as these.
When I go back to the next <unk>, two things are you that we can make any future to imagine, and that we can play any game.
So, I say, let's give the games that <unk> the world.
Thank you.
For some time I've been interested in the <unk> effect, it can look like a <unk> thing, if you <unk>, unless you get from my point of view, "which is something that is <unk> <unk> <unk>." In other words, the <unk> of <unk> have a <unk> effect in some other words, the effect, because the <unk> of <unk> have a <unk> effect in some of the studies, just because the <unk> thinks it thinks
that what's happening is to a <unk> or something like that --
The pain <unk>, for example, if you believe that they have a <unk> effect in the body called <unk>.
<unk> of <unk> becomes something true for the <unk> that if it has got.
So to show you a <unk> <unk> <unk>, very simple.
And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a <unk> that's present in all the books for children.
I learned it from just <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
I <unk> it for you and so I'll <unk> you.
And so I'll tell you why I <unk> you.
Here's what happens.
The <unk>, which you can <unk>; my hand, which you can <unk>.
I just wanted to <unk> my <unk>, like this.
<unk> on the <unk>.
For sure that nothing <unk> or <unk> from my <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> my <unk> like this.
So, you can see that you ever see that something can go. <unk> <unk> here, nothing goes from my <unk>.
And the purpose of all that is simple.
I started my hand, and if all went well, my <unk> <unk> animal <unk> <unk>.
In fact, he <unk> so <unk> to his place that I can <unk>, and the <unk> doesn't <unk>.
<unk> <unk> or down from my <unk>.
<unk>. You can <unk> anything.
<unk>!
This is a <unk> that often <unk> to children.
which is <unk> to the <unk>, because you can learn a lot about the <unk> <unk>, even though <unk> is very simple.
Many of you in this room, <unk> this <unk>.
Here's what happens to <unk> my <unk>.
I <unk> <unk> my <unk>.
to <unk> that <unk> or <unk> from my <unk>, this is a <unk>.
The reason I'm <unk> the <unk> is because that's the <unk> of <unk>.
In the moment my hand is moving away from you, this finger, my finger, <unk> <unk> <unk> was in a position that <unk> was in a position that <unk> in the outside of so <unk>.
There's somebody who didn't have a <unk> here.
So that's like, right here, right.
And when I also <unk> my finger.
We can talk about why it is <unk>, because we don't know that there are only three <unk> because the mind, and the way we <unk> information, not <unk>, one, two, three. They <unk> them.
But this is not the point. Right? And when I <unk> my hand, I'm <unk> <unk> not through the animal <unk>, but through <unk>, <unk> my <unk> here.
And when I <unk> my finger, same thing, when I <unk> back, this movement <unk> your finger.
<unk> away the hand. The <unk> is away.
It's a <unk> that you can do with your friends and <unk>. Thank you.
Now, what does it have to do with the <unk> effect?
I read a study of a year ago that <unk> me <unk>.
I'm not a doctor or a <unk>, so that was amazing thing.
It seems that if you <unk> a <unk> in the form of a <unk> <unk>, which is <unk>, just a <unk> <unk> effect.
But if you <unk> the shape and you <unk> the <unk>, <unk> of a smaller <unk>, and color color and you <unk> a letter is to <unk>.
Even though, there is no <unk> -- are <unk> of <unk>.
But a <unk> <unk> is not <unk> as a blue <unk>.
What? It really <unk> me.
But anyway, it's not here.
<unk> are <unk> of any form.
A <unk> <unk>, who is <unk> on one side and <unk> on the other is better than a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> has a role.
A <unk> twice a day, it's not as <unk> as three <unk> -- I don't remember the <unk>.
But the point is --
-- that these <unk> have a role.
And the form of the role of it.
And if you want the <unk> <unk>, you have to use a <unk>.
Right? A <unk> with something -- a couple of <unk> of something <unk>.
I <unk> it in a patient --
This is a <unk> picture in their mind, much <unk> than the <unk> <unk>.
It's real, this <unk> -- I'll show you one other time when I'm <unk>.
The point is that the <unk> <unk> is not <unk> as the blue one that is not as <unk> as the <unk>, which is not as a <unk>.
And nobody of these has a <unk> quality.
It's just your believe that makes them in your <unk> and <unk> the effect.
I wanted to see if I could take this idea and start a <unk> <unk>.
And to do something that is a <unk> <unk> and make it real.
And we know from that study that when you want a effect, you know, you know, you know, and you know, from that <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk>.
I'll <unk> it a little bit.
This is my meat. This is not <unk> special.
This is my skin. This is not a <unk> <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> my skin and have this <unk> to go to the <unk> <unk>.
If you <unk> <unk> -- if I could easily <unk> -- I did it for some friends in the <unk>, the other night, and some of them who didn't <unk>, and a woman is almost <unk>.
So if I could easily <unk>, I would say that I won't <unk> for the next few <unk> in the next <unk>.
You can see, you can look at it, you can look at it.
So that's what happens, right here, the beginning of my meat <unk> my arm just I'm going to just a little hole.
<unk>. <unk> I'm <unk> you?
And now a little bit through my skin, and out on the other side, like that.
Now, we're in the same position where we were with the <unk> <unk>.
<unk>. But you can't <unk> my <unk> now, right?
So I'll show you. Here, two, three, four, five, five, yes, OK --
I know what people think when they see that.
He said, "<unk> will not be so <unk> to <unk> skin to <unk> a few minutes."
So, let me show you to give you a <unk>.
How do you think? <unk> good.
Yes, I know I <unk> there the <unk> behind "OK, I don't really have seen it."
People in the <unk> <unk> are <unk>.
We want to show up close.
This is really my skin. It's not a special effect of <unk>.
This is my meat, and I can <unk> around.
<unk>, if you're <unk> to look at the other end, don't look at it.
People at the bottom or that <unk> a few years in the <unk> video, "<unk>, is clear that it some effect, but if it was true, he was, he --
You see there's a hole here and a hole here, if it was true. "
Well, now I'm going to get a little blood for you.
Here.
Now, let's <unk> the <unk>.
I <unk> my arm, and I'll show you that there are no <unk>.
But I think in this context and with the idea of taking something <unk> and <unk> into something true, the <unk> <unk> is, and I <unk> it from the stage.
We're going to <unk> a few times in the next few days, I hope I won't <unk> the time. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
So, in my life I met with a lot of fish.
I've just <unk> two.
The first one, it <unk> more than another <unk> story.
It was a <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> one of the most <unk> <unk> on the <unk>.
That fish!
What was even better, was from a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
So, you'll start with the <unk> in the <unk>.
I've been <unk> in a relationship with this beauty for several months.
One day, the head of the company <unk> and I decided to talk to me about a <unk> event at the <unk> <unk>.
"<unk>" I said.
This was a company that <unk> to solve what's <unk> is a <unk> problem for our <unk>.
How do we continue to get the fish in our <unk>?
<unk> the last 50 years we have <unk> in the same way that we've <unk> to the ground the <unk>.
<unk> was <unk>.
<unk> percent of the big fish, the ones that <unk> us so much <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>,
There's almost nothing left.
So, we <unk> or less <unk>, the <unk> of fish, <unk> part of our future.
There are a lot of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> fish <unk>, for the least the <unk> of them, and they are <unk>. They're <unk>. They're <unk>. They're <unk> for example.
A big problem is there is a <unk> <unk> rate of 15 to one.
This means that they want to 15 <unk> fish to get a <unk> <unk>.
It's not very sustainable.
And the <unk> is not a big one.
So here's where, finally there was a company that was <unk> to do it in the right way.
I wanted to <unk> it.
The day before the event I <unk> at the head of the company <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
"<unk>," I said, "I said," You know, you're <unk> to make <unk> so far, in the open, which you don't know. "
"<unk>," he said, "We are so <unk> by the <unk> that our <unk> are <unk>, not <unk>."
And then we're basically a <unk> world. "
"Is the <unk> <unk>? <unk> at one said.
"The best in the business."
<unk> to one, great.
"<unk> to one thing? What would you eat to eat?"
"<unk> <unk>," he said.
"<unk>," I said. And I <unk> the <unk>.
That night, I was in bed, <unk>: But what <unk> is a sustainable <unk>?
So the next day, just before the event, <unk> it still <unk>.
I said, "<unk>, do you know, do you do?"
He said he didn't know, and he would <unk> around.
Well, I'm going to start with some people in the company and nobody would <unk> an <unk> response.
We finally got to <unk> with the <unk>.
He also <unk>.
"<unk>," <unk> "I said," You know, "<unk> <unk>?"
Well, he <unk> some <unk> <unk> some <unk> <unk> of the fish and then said, "<unk> of <unk>."
I said, "<unk> of <unk>?"
He said, "Yes, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>."
He said, "<unk> <unk> of your <unk> is <unk>?"
<unk>, say, two percent.
"Well, that's about 30 percent," he said.
He said, "<unk>, what's the sustainable fish to the <unk> fish of <unk> to eat?"
There was a long time on the phone and said, "There are just <unk> in the world."
I'm going to talk about this fish.
No, not because I'm one of those <unk> <unk> <unk> and traditional food.
Well, actually, I'm going to say that.
No, in fact, I'm going to talk about this fish, because you know, the <unk> knew of <unk>.
The second fish is a different love history.
It's a <unk> story that kind of history that the most <unk> the fish and the most <unk>.
I <unk> it for the first time in a <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
My <unk> <unk> me had talked to me about a fish.
<unk> was <unk>.
<unk> on the table had a white color, almost <unk>.
The <unk> had too much <unk>.
It's about how it had to be <unk>.
<unk>, it was still <unk>.
Who is able to make a good fish that's <unk> <unk>?
I don't, but this guy.
<unk> <unk>.
It's actually called <unk>.
No, he didn't <unk> the fish, and it's not a <unk>.
For less, not in the sense that I usually do.
It's a <unk> <unk>. The <unk> that's a <unk> of fish in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> was <unk> by <unk>.
<unk> <unk> on what was essentially a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> the land by building a series of <unk> <unk> <unk> so water in the river.
Well, we don't really get it to work out the economic <unk>.
And, from the <unk> point, was a <unk>.
He had <unk> something like 90 percent of the birds and, <unk> the place, it's about many birds.
So, in <unk> a company <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What do you do?
It's <unk> flow.
<unk>, <unk> <unk>.
Instead of <unk> water from the ground <unk> the <unk> to <unk>.
We <unk> all the <unk>.
It <unk> a fish <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and in this process, <unk> and this company completely <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> is incredible.
I mean, you've never seen a thing like this.
It looks like the <unk> that it seems to be a million miles away, and all you see are <unk> and this <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
I was there a little bit of time ago with <unk>.
It's an amazing guy, Charles <unk> <unk> and a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Okay? <unk> <unk> in the middle of this <unk> and I <unk>, <unk>, I had the <unk> to the <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk> his <unk>.
<unk> I <unk> a white <unk>.
Then he <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, and then he <unk> a kind of fish that <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>.
He <unk> out that <unk> <unk> <unk> in Africa.
I asked him how he became such a fish <unk>.
I said, "<unk>? I don't know.
I'm a <unk> in relationships. "
And immediately after you <unk> on <unk> birds, <unk> <unk> and <unk> plants.
It wasn't really, this was very fascinating, which is, which is, like, a thing like the <unk> community.
Yes, but I was <unk>.
And my head <unk> to <unk> that <unk> fish I had <unk> last night.
So I said, "<unk>, what makes your fish that's so good?"
He <unk> the <unk>.
"I know, I know, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, relationships, yes, is an amazing thing.
But what do you <unk>?
What is your <unk> <unk> <unk>?
Well, I <unk> of how their own <unk> system is so <unk> that the fish will <unk> exactly what happened in an <unk> environment.
The <unk> of plants, the <unk>, the <unk>, is all that <unk> the fish.
The system is so in health that it's <unk>.
There are no <unk>.
Have you ever heard of a <unk> who doesn't give up to eat his animals?
And I later, I was <unk> around with <unk> <unk>, and I said, "In a place like this natural <unk> that I've ever seen, how do you do?"
In that <unk> moment, it was like the <unk> of a film had <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>.
<unk> the corner and <unk> a scene between the <unk> <unk> thousands and thousands of <unk> <unk> a real <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
"That's the success."
"<unk> their <unk> are <unk>. They're <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. "
<unk>? I was completely <unk>.
I said, "<unk>, but are they not <unk> with your fish?"
"Yes, he said.
"<unk> about 20 percent of the fish and fish <unk> for the birds.
<unk> year on this property, there were <unk> birds than <unk> species.
It became the biggest and one of the most important <unk> <unk> for birds in all Europe. "
He said, "<unk>, but a <unk> population of birds isn't the last thing that we're going to <unk> in a fish <unk>?"
<unk> your head, no.
They said, "We <unk> <unk> not <unk>.
This is a <unk> network.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
So the more <unk> is the <unk> of the most <unk> <unk> is the system. "
OK, so <unk>: A <unk> that doesn't give to eat his own <unk>, and that measure its success in the <unk> of his <unk>.
A fish <unk>, but also a <unk> for birds.
<unk>, by the way, those <unk> should not be there.
<unk> the <unk> in a city <unk> <unk> miles where the ground of the ground of the ground construction are better for the building.
Every morning, <unk> for <unk> miles and come to the <unk> and every night, you're doing more miles per <unk>.
They do it because they're able to follow the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> serious.
It <unk> something like the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> so <unk>.
And I said, "<unk>, <unk> <unk> miles to the <unk> and then <unk> miles back <unk>?
<unk> it for their little? "
I <unk> as if I had just <unk> a song of <unk> <unk>.
He said, "No, do it because food is better."
I didn't talk to you about my skin <unk> fish that was <unk>, and I usually don't like the skin of the fish.
I don't like to <unk>, I don't like to <unk>.
It's that <unk> <unk>, like <unk>.
It never <unk>.
<unk>, when I <unk> it in that <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> didn't know for anything of the skin.
He had a <unk> <unk> and <unk> was like to <unk> a <unk> on the ocean.
He <unk> this to <unk>, and he <unk>.
He said, "<unk> is like a <unk>.
It's the last <unk> before any of the fish.
It's <unk> to <unk> the <unk>. "
And then he said, "But our water doesn't <unk>."
OK. A <unk> that doesn't <unk> his fish.
A <unk> that <unk> their own <unk> <unk> of success.
And then I realized that when he says that <unk> didn't have to <unk> much about the thing, because the water <unk> in that <unk> is a river that <unk> in that <unk> it is a river that brings up to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And when it <unk> along the system, it <unk> the water is <unk> than when it's <unk>.
The system is so in health, which <unk> water.
So, not only a <unk> that doesn't <unk> his animals not only <unk> her own <unk>, but a <unk> that is literally a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> that's literally a <unk> of <unk> water and not just for you fish, but for me for you.
Because when the water <unk>, you go to the <unk>.
It's a <unk> in the ocean, I know but I <unk> the <unk>, and so I also <unk> to do that you because this <unk> of love for <unk> is also <unk>.
You could say it's a <unk> for the future of good food is that it's <unk> of fish that are <unk>.
What we need now is a <unk> new <unk> of the agriculture in which food has a lot of good <unk>.
But for many people, that's a little too <unk>.
We are not <unk>, we <unk> food.
We are <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> of little <unk>.
<unk> the little <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of the local food <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
And when you believe that these are the things that <unk> the future of good food from some of the time, and says, "You know, I'm <unk> <unk> <unk>, but how do you think we can <unk> the whole world?
How do you think we <unk> the world? "
Can I be <unk>?
It's a question that I don't like.
No, not because we're already <unk> that enough to <unk> the world.
One billion people are <unk> <unk> today.
One billion -- more than there are ever been -- because of the huge <unk> in the distribution of <unk>.
You see, I don't like this question because it has <unk> the <unk> of our food system in the last 50 years.
<unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the fish <unk> and all this time the <unk> industry, simply asked. "If we can get more people more <unk>, what do you do?"
This is the <unk>.
It was the <unk>.
It was the <unk> business plan.
<unk> <unk> for what is, a industry in <unk> a industry that is quickly <unk> capital quickly, capital <unk> capital that makes the possible.
This is not a industry, and it's not agriculture.
Our <unk> today is not <unk> because of the <unk> in <unk> but for the last <unk>, not for the last <unk>, but for the <unk> water, not for the <unk>, but for the water <unk> is not for <unk>, but for the <unk> water, not for <unk>, but for the <unk> and <unk>, but for the sea in the sea.
<unk> <unk> the world?
<unk> to <unk>: How do we <unk> ourselves?
Or, how can we create the conditions that are <unk> to every local communities in <unk> themselves?
To do that, we don't look at the model of the future <unk>.
It's a <unk> and <unk> model.
It's about capital, chemistry and <unk>, and it never really <unk> anything good to eat.
Instead, we look at the <unk> model.
It's what we're going to <unk> on the work.
<unk> <unk>, <unk> as <unk> <unk> and <unk> that are not <unk> in <unk>, because they're not <unk> in themselves to <unk> that <unk> instead of <unk> that <unk> instead of just <unk> that are <unk>, because they are the ones who are also <unk> in <unk>.
If I have to be really <unk>, they're better <unk> than I've ever been.
You know, I think that's good, because if that's the future of food, it's going to be <unk>.
Thank you.
I grew up with a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> a <unk>, an hour back and forth every day.
And I was always <unk> in a book, a book of <unk>, which <unk> my mind in other <unk>, and <unk>, in <unk> form, that <unk> sense, that <unk> sense of <unk> that I had.
And that <unk> <unk> also <unk> that every time I was not at school I was out in the <unk>, to <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> them to the <unk>.
I was a real science <unk>.
But it's always <unk> to try to understand the world, understanding the <unk> of the world.
And my love for the <unk> in fact seemed to <unk> the world around me, because what was happening in the late '<unk>, we were going to the moon, and we were going on the moon, and <unk> the <unk> <unk> in our <unk> with his <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> us and places and a wonderful world that we couldn't have imagine.
So, all seemed to <unk> my passion for <unk>.
And I was an artist.
I could draw. <unk> <unk>.
And <unk> there were no <unk>, no <unk> of this <unk> film <unk>, and not all these pictures in my head.
As a child, we all <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, to put something on the screen of our <unk>.
And so, my answer was <unk>, draw creatures, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, robot <unk>, all this stuff.
<unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> behind the book.
This is because creativity had to find a <unk> <unk> in some way.
And it's <unk> a interesting thing: the <unk> <unk> <unk> programs very much for the fact that there was a <unk> world right here on the planet.
<unk> I never would ever go to a <unk> world on a <unk> <unk>.
It's very <unk>.
But that was a world where I could really go for, right here on the planet, more <unk> and <unk> of what I could ever imagine <unk> these books.
So, I decided I would be a <unk> at the age of 15.
And the only problem was that we were in a small country in the <unk>, <unk> miles from the ocean.
But I didn't let me go.
I <unk> my father found a school in <unk>, New York, just past the <unk> of where I was <unk>.
And so I've been able to take the <unk> into a <unk> <unk> in <unk>, New York.
And I wouldn't see the ocean, for another two years, until we <unk> it in California.
<unk> then, in the last <unk> 40 years, I've <unk> about <unk> hours <unk> water, and 500 of these hours in <unk>.
And I learned that the <unk> of the ocean, even the <unk> ocean, are <unk> of amazing life that really goes beyond our imagination.
The imagination of nature is without <unk> to our human imagination.
And today, I'm <unk> from what I see when I do <unk>.
And my story of love with the <unk> ocean, <unk> of how much it's ever been.
But when I <unk> a career, as a career, I <unk> to make films.
It's got to be the best way to <unk> this <unk> of <unk> with <unk>.
And, as a kid, <unk> <unk> <unk> and so on.
So, making films was the only way to put together images and stories.
All <unk>.
And of course the stories I <unk> to tell was stories of <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "and" The <unk>. "
And with "The <unk>," I <unk> my love for <unk> and <unk> with the <unk> of a film.
So, I <unk> the two <unk>.
<unk> "The <unk>" came out of something interesting that was that it had to solve a <unk> problem in that film, which is creating that kind of <unk> water <unk>, we <unk> the <unk> <unk> with the computer.
And so it was born the first character to the <unk> surface and <unk> to computers that it was ever seen in a movie.
And even though the movie doesn't have a lot of money, <unk> that <unk> is <unk>, I've been <unk> of something extraordinary, all the public was <unk> by this <unk> <unk>.
You know, it's the <unk> <unk> <unk> that every <unk> technology is <unk> by <unk>.
You're seeing something <unk>.
And that really <unk> me.
And I thought, "<unk>, this is something that has to be <unk> in the <unk> art."
So, with "<unk> two," my next film, we went far beyond.
<unk> with the <unk> <unk> and <unk>, we created the <unk> <unk> <unk> in that movie. The <unk> <unk> by how that <unk> would <unk> that effect.
And it <unk>. And we have again, and we've got a <unk>.
And we <unk> the same result with a public.
But we've <unk> a little bit more with that movie.
So, I <unk> a line between these two <unk> of experience, I've come to the <unk> that this would be a new world, was a whole new world that was <unk> for the <unk> artists.
<unk>, I put a <unk> company in <unk> <unk>, my <unk> friend <unk>, who was the main <unk> and designers, and we call it <unk> <unk>.
And the principle of society was <unk> to <unk> the past, the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and so on and go directly to the digital production.
And so we did it and we gave it a little bit for a little bit.
But we're <unk> back to half the '<unk> in the part of the creatures of the characters and characters, which is what we had <unk> society.
So, I wrote this <unk> <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> on the <unk> effects, <unk> to the computer, with human <unk>, and all the major characters in the computer world, and all the major characters in the computer.
And the whole thing was <unk> to <unk>.
The kids in society have told me that they didn't have been able to do it for a little bit.
So, I <unk> it and I made this film of a <unk> <unk>.
I <unk> it there as a "<unk> and <unk> on a <unk>."
It would be a story of <unk> love, a <unk> film.
<unk>, what I wanted to do was to see the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
That's why I did that film.
And it's the truth. The study didn't know.
But I <unk> them. I said, "We <unk> it to the <unk>." I'm going to go to the <unk>.
I <unk> it for the beginning of the movie.
It's very important. It's a great <unk> <unk>. "
And I <unk> them to <unk> a <unk>.
It looks like it. But this <unk> us back to the imagination.
Because we really did a <unk> reality and six months after I <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, to look at the true <unk> of the North, to look at the real <unk> from a <unk>, not in a movie, but for really.
I was <unk>.
And there's a lot of <unk>, we had to build <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and a lot of other things.
But I was <unk> by the <unk> <unk>, was like a <unk> mission.
Where everything was <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> you in this <unk>, you go down to this <unk> <unk> environment where there are no <unk> to be <unk>, where you can't go back from the alone.
And I thought, "<unk>. It's like living in a <unk> film.
It's really great. "
And so, I was <unk> by the <unk> of the ocean <unk>.
<unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
It was all. It was <unk>.
It was <unk>. It was imagination.
And it was a experience that <unk> couldn't <unk> me.
Of course, I could imagine a <unk>, and create a <unk> effect. But I couldn't imagine what I would come out of the <unk>.
And in our <unk>, I've seen creatures with <unk> <unk> and, sometimes, things that I'd never seen before, that, that didn't even see before, that was not even <unk> from science at the time that we <unk> and imagine.
So I was all of this, and I had to do it.
So I got a <unk> decision.
After the <unk> <unk>, I said, "OK, I said," OK, I'll go from my <unk> work <unk>, and I'm going to <unk> it at a while. "
So, we started <unk> these <unk>.
We went to the <unk> and <unk> with <unk> <unk>.
We're <unk> to the <unk> of <unk>.
We've taken little robot with <unk> that we've created with <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And the idea was to go into and do a <unk> <unk>, which was never done.
<unk> had ever <unk> within the <unk>. They had no <unk> to do it, so we created the technology to do it.
So here we go on the <unk> of the <unk>, <unk> the <unk> that <unk> just like this, where I knew they had <unk> <unk>.
And I'm <unk> a little <unk> <unk> through the <unk> of <unk>.
When I say, I'm <unk>, but my mind is in <unk>.
It seemed to me to be <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>.
And it was the most <unk> experience that I've ever lived, because I've been <unk> the <unk> thing, I knew what would be behind, before the <unk> <unk>, because I had the <unk> <unk>, because I had the <unk> for months <unk> the film.
And the <unk> was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> model.
So it was an absolutely extraordinary experience.
And it really <unk> me to realize that in the experience of the <unk> that you can <unk> through these <unk>, the mind is <unk> in the <unk>, in this other form of existence.
It was really very deep.
And it could be a little <unk> of what could happen in some <unk> when you get <unk> for <unk> or other reasons in some kind of <unk> future, in some kind of the <unk> future that I can imagine, from the <unk> of which I'm.
So, we did these <unk>, and we started to <unk> what was there under, like the <unk> of the ocean <unk> where there were these animals.
<unk>, I'm <unk> right here on the ground.
It's going to be in an environment of <unk>.
We don't <unk> in a <unk> system on the <unk> of the sun, we do.
So, you see animals that live near <unk> <unk>.
It seems impossible to <unk> that.
And at the same time I was <unk> very much to science, again, once again, is the flu of <unk>, as a guy.
And I ended up in the <unk> <unk>, really <unk> with NASA, <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of NASA, <unk> <unk> <unk>, going to <unk>, going to <unk>, to <unk> <unk> <unk>, and all these things, to fly to the <unk> <unk> <unk> with our <unk>.
It was fascinating.
But what I ended up doing to do was take scientists <unk> with us in the <unk>.
And I <unk> down because you had to have <unk> <unk> <unk>, scientists, <unk> to these <unk> <unk>, <unk> down and <unk> them to see, take <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> and so on.
So, we were <unk> <unk>, but in fact, <unk> science, <unk> science,
I had <unk> <unk> between being <unk> <unk>, as a kid, to do those things for really.
And you know, in this path of discovery, I learned a lot.
I've learned a lot of science. But I've learned a lot about <unk>.
Everybody think a <unk> <unk> is a leader, the <unk> of <unk>, or something like that.
I didn't know anything about <unk> before I do all the <unk>.
Because at some point I had to say, "What am I doing here?
Why am I doing that? What do you <unk>?
It's not going to do all these <unk>.
In <unk> we're going to <unk>. There's no <unk>.
People think about that I've been <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> that I <unk> the <unk> <unk> on some <unk>.
I've done all these films, all these <unk> for a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, no <unk>, no money. What am I doing?
I'm doing it for the task in itself, for the challenge -- and the ocean is the biggest challenge that <unk>, for the <unk> of discovery, and to that strange <unk> that you <unk> when a small group of people in a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Because it's all with <unk> people, working together for years.
<unk> <unk> for <unk> months.
And in that <unk>, you realize that the important thing is the respect you have for them and that they have for you, when you <unk> a task you can't tell any other.
When you go to the ground and it <unk>, "We had to do this, and the <unk> <unk>, and the <unk>, and that, all technology, and the <unk>, the <unk> of human <unk>, when you're working in the sea <unk> you can explain. It's what perhaps the thing they've only <unk> or the soldiers have lived with something together and know that they never <unk>.
<unk> a <unk>, create a <unk> of respect.
When I'm <unk> to make my next film, I'm going to <unk>, "I've been trying to <unk> the team and <unk> it to <unk> their respect.
It's really <unk> the <unk>.
And so I'm going to go back and again, once with a small group, in <unk> <unk> with new technologies that don't <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
And we're <unk> a family, in the <unk> of four and a half years.
And it changed my way to make films.
People have <unk> by saying that I've taken organisms from the ocean, and I <unk> them on the planet.
For me, it was the <unk> of the way of doing business, the process itself, that changed.
What can we do?
What are the <unk> we've learned?
I think the first is <unk>.
It's the most powerful thing that we <unk>.
The imagination is a force that can actually <unk> a reality.
And the <unk> of the group is more important than all the <unk> in the world.
<unk> <unk> come to me and say, "<unk> a few <unk> to do this."
And I said, "Don't <unk> <unk>.
I <unk> people to <unk> it for you, not by yourself, not <unk> against yourself.
And they <unk>. "
<unk> is, you always say this <unk>: "<unk> is <unk>."
But the <unk> has to be an <unk> in art and <unk>, because it's like to do a <unk> in <unk>.
And no important <unk> that has <unk> innovation is done without <unk>.
It's got to <unk> these <unk>.
This is the thought I want to <unk>, which is in any <unk> thing, which is in any <unk>, but <unk>. Thank you.
If you can figure out how you can get you to understand a single idea that would be bigger than the <unk> of the parts, and that, instead of thinking about <unk> information, I would like to think about how we use information to make new relationships that we can <unk> new relationships to <unk> new relationships so to <unk>.
Here you see <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for age.
This tool that I use is a little experiment.
It's called <unk>, and with <unk> I can choose to <unk> one cause of death, say <unk>.
And now we can see new relationships.
The reason is that there in the central part of the <unk> people are <unk>; and there are more <unk>.
We can take a step back and <unk> data for <unk>, we see that <unk> and cancer is the biggest <unk>, but not for all.
If we go on and <unk> for age, we'll see that <unk> are the cause of death that we're going to be more.
It's <unk> <unk>, especially for men.
So you have to understand that <unk> information and data in these ways, it's a little bit like <unk> in a sea of <unk> information.
And if we can do it with <unk> data because we can't do it with <unk>?
For example here we have the <unk> of every <unk> that we've ever <unk>.
All right. All the <unk>.
You can <unk> it in your <unk> and also try.
And you can see that you can see a <unk>.
Or a year <unk>.
You can <unk> a number in particular number.
For example, we take the <unk> that we <unk> in this number, their <unk>.
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk>, so I'm going to go and I see all the numbers in.
Now, if I want to take a look, I could think, "Why don't you look at all the <unk>?"
<unk> a step back and <unk> the <unk>.
And I see <unk> <unk>.
And so you can see that when you <unk> between the information in this <unk> way, <unk>, and back is not just a research, it's not just the <unk>.
But you do something different.
It's a way of the <unk> that we <unk> to use information.
I still have this idea that it may seem a little bit <unk>.
We've taken every single page of <unk> and we've <unk> it to a short <unk> that <unk> into a little <unk>, and a <unk> area that <unk> the <unk> area.
I'm just going to show you the first 500 <unk> on <unk>.
Even in this <unk> <unk>, we can do a lot.
It's immediately what <unk> are the most <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
So, we <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And so, in fact, we see that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is <unk> because it <unk> something that was in the pages of <unk>.
And you can see it just <unk> up a step back to see the together.
If you take one of these <unk>, I can then put on the <unk>, "<unk> <unk>."
and everybody <unk>.
And then I see that most <unk> <unk> by <unk> some of the world's <unk>. A number of science <unk>.
Here's my head.
One is from music.
And, rather interesting, <unk> has also won a <unk> TED <unk>.
So let's start seeing all the <unk> of the TED <unk>.
For the first time we're actually <unk> in the network, as if it was a network, not from page on the page, but at a <unk> level.
I want to show you another thing that might be <unk>.
This is the New York Times site.
<unk>, this <unk> -- I don't call it <unk>, because it's not a <unk>, but it's still to see pages. We <unk> this technology to <unk> it to every page, like this.
I can take a step back and immediately back to a <unk> <unk>. This is important because the only show the pages so I can see all the pages so it makes me look like this whole <unk> in the Internet.
I can <unk> on what I did at in <unk> moments.
In fact, you can see the <unk> of the <unk> I just <unk>.
I can <unk> in a certain sense, other things that I've seen in the day.
If I want to take a step back and see all I can do my <unk> or the <unk> of my research or the <unk> of my research.
Here we go to <unk>, <unk> the <unk> engine, here to <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And I can <unk> on my page page and just <unk> it from here.
A <unk> <unk> many times, and in each case the result is the greater than the <unk> of the parts, the <unk> data.
<unk>, in the world, data is <unk> like a <unk>.
It's about <unk> of information.
It's about <unk> in data.
And if you <unk> all <unk> if you <unk> the web <unk> instead of <unk> the Web <unk> instead of <unk>, we'll go from many things to many other, and then see those <unk> structures that <unk> <unk>?
And instead of <unk> <unk> in data, we could really <unk> information.
Instead of <unk> just of information, we can <unk> out of knowledge.
And you know, maybe you get to the <unk>.
And with this <unk> you.
And these days, they're all talking about happiness.
I asked to <unk> the number of books <unk> the word "happiness" in <unk> and <unk> over the last five years, have <unk> to <unk> 40, and there were many more.
There's a huge <unk> of interest in happiness, in <unk>.
There's a lot of <unk> about happiness.
Everybody <unk> the <unk> people to <unk>.
But <unk> this flow of work, there are a series of "<unk> <unk>" that somehow make <unk> ideas about happiness.
My talk of today is <unk> these "<unk> <unk>."
And it's about <unk> people who think about happiness, and it's about <unk> that <unk> happiness, because we are <unk> all the other people.
The first of these <unk> is the <unk> to <unk> complexity.
In fact, that the word happiness is not a useful word in the <unk> <unk>.
I think that you can <unk> to a particular meaning, but in the <unk>, <unk> <unk> of this <unk> and <unk> the most <unk> of this <unk> and <unk> <unk> vision of what <unk> is.
The second <unk> is the <unk> of experience and memory: in practice, is that it's about being <unk> between being happy in life and <unk>.
And these are two very different <unk>, both of the concept of happiness.
And the third is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that we can't think of any <unk> that <unk> on the <unk> without <unk>.
I mean, it's a real <unk> <unk>.
and there's no way of doing the right thing.
I'd like to start with an example of a person who, after a <unk> of questions and answers, after my lesson, I <unk> a story.
[<unk>] <unk> that as you <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> music absolutely <unk> right at the end of the <unk>, <unk> <unk> sound.
And then <unk>, <unk> very <unk>, who had <unk> the whole experience.
But it wasn't true.
What was <unk> was the <unk> of the experience.
He had <unk> the experience.
And she had <unk> for 20 minutes of the <unk> music.
But that's not going to happen because he was <unk> with a certain <unk>; I remember was <unk>, and the age of all that the <unk>.
What this <unk> tells us, at the bottom, is that we could think about ourselves and other people in terms of two <unk>.
There's a <unk> that lives in the present, who lives in the present, and it's able to <unk> the past, but it's <unk> only the present.
It's about the "that it's <unk>." And what the <unk> is <unk> -- you know when <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk> you now, when you're going to here?"
And then there is the "<unk>" that's <unk>, "that's <unk>" that <unk> the points, and it's going to tell you about the history of our life, and that "which is the <unk> of <unk>." How are you heard of the last few days? "
or "<unk> <unk> <unk> your journey?" or something like that.
<unk> are two different <unk>, the <unk> that lives a experience, and what if the <unk>, and <unk> between the two is part of the <unk> on the <unk> of happiness.
The <unk>, is a <unk>.
And this process starts with a fundamental answer of our <unk> -- it starts immediately.
We don't tell stories just when we try to <unk>.
Our memory tell stories, <unk>, what we have is a story of our experiences is a story.
Let me start with an example.
It's a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the experiences of two patients in a <unk> <unk>.
I didn't <unk>. It's not even <unk> a day. It's not even <unk> a day. But it was when this study was <unk> in the '<unk>.
They <unk> to <unk> patients <unk> their <unk> every 60 seconds.
And here are the results of two patients.
<unk> are their results.
If you ask, "Who's got two more <unk>?"
It's a very simple question.
<unk>, the <unk> <unk> has <unk> of the <unk>.
His <unk> <unk> more and for every minute of <unk>, <unk> by patient's <unk> at least <unk>, at least as much as it is.
But now there's another question: "How much these patients think they <unk>?"
And here's the <unk>: <unk> <unk>. A <unk> <unk> <unk>. And I remember the <unk> <unk> <unk>
The stories of the <unk> were different because a particularly <unk> of the <unk> is the way you <unk> -- none of these stories are particularly <unk> -- but one of the two is particularly <unk> -- one of the two is particularly <unk>.
And the <unk> is that where the pain was <unk> at the end.
It's a <unk> story.
How do I <unk>?
Why did we asked these people after <unk>, and even a distance, "How much <unk> is the experience, all <unk>?"
and <unk> of most <unk> for me to <unk>.
So this is a <unk> <unk> between the <unk> that lives the experiences that live in the experiences that the <unk>.
In the <unk> of <unk> that lives the experience, is clear that <unk> has <unk>.
So, what you could do for the patient. At, we <unk> experiments, and we <unk> experiments, and it's really done, and it's working, you could <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>. And you can <unk> the <unk> <unk> without too much.
This is a little bit of pain in the patient, but only a little bit, and it's much less than before.
And by doing this for a couple of minutes, the <unk> that lives the experience of <unk>. <unk>, and the <unk> that <unk> the experiences of <unk>. <unk>, <unk>, now the <unk> of her experience.
How do you tell a story?
And that's true for stories that come from the <unk> that for stories that <unk> what they're going to tell what a story is about the <unk> moments and the <unk>.
<unk> are very, very important, in this case, the final <unk>.
So, the <unk> that lives living experiences living life <unk>.
It's about experiences that you live in and <unk>. And it's like this?
And the answer is simple.
They're <unk> for always to say that most of the moments of our life -- for how I <unk> them -- I mean, the <unk> <unk> is saying about three seconds. The one is saying about three seconds in a month, and it's about <unk> million. In a month, if we <unk> about <unk> most of the time.
Most of them are completely <unk> by the <unk> that <unk>.
And yet, in some way you have the feeling that they should be <unk>, that what's going on in these moments of experience is our lives.
It's the <unk> that we're <unk> as we're in this world.
And as a <unk>, <unk> <unk>, but it's not the story that the <unk> that <unk> <unk> for us.
So we have a <unk> that <unk> and a <unk> that lives experiences that are quite different.
The biggest difference between the two is how we spend time on the time.
In the <unk> of the <unk> that lives the experiences of <unk>, if you live in <unk>, and the second <unk> is as much as the first one, then the <unk> of two weeks is two to <unk>.
But this is not the same way the <unk> works.
For the <unk> that <unk>, a <unk> of two weeks is <unk> better than a week of <unk> because there are no new <unk> in <unk>.
You've never changed the story.
And in this way, time is the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> that <unk> out of the <unk> that <unk> that <unk>.
<unk> has a <unk> impact on this story.
<unk>, the <unk> that <unk> <unk> experiences <unk> more than and <unk> and tell stories.
It's actually the <unk> that makes decisions because if you <unk> a patient who had, for example, two <unk> with two different <unk> and is <unk> what he <unk> is <unk> what he <unk> is what he <unk> is what he <unk> is what he <unk> is.
The <unk> that lives in the experiences not have voice in these choices.
In fact, we don't <unk> between experiences, but among the <unk> of those experiences.
And even when we think about our future, in which we don't think about our future as experiences.
We're going to go to our future as <unk> <unk>.
So, you can <unk> this situation, like a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk>, and you can think about the <unk> that <unk> as if you <unk> the <unk> that lives the experiences that you live the experiences that you live the experiences of which, the <unk> that doesn't need.
I have the feeling that when we're going to <unk>, the case that, <unk> in a good part of our <unk> that we're going to <unk>.
And this is a little bit difficult to <unk>.
<unk>, how much "<unk>" our <unk>?
This is one of the <unk> that's <unk> for the <unk> <unk>.
When I think about that, I think, a <unk> in the <unk> of a few years ago, which is one of the best <unk> of my life, and I think <unk> often, <unk> to other <unk>.
And I've probably spent on the <unk> of that <unk> three weeks, to say, 25 minutes in the last four years.
If I've ever opened the <unk> with <unk> photographs of the journey, I would have <unk> another one. It's about three weeks of journey that <unk> into the <unk> an hour and <unk>. It looks like it's a <unk>.
<unk>, I could be a little <unk>, in my <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk>, but even if you were more of this, a <unk> question is <unk>.
Why do we take weight away from the weight that we <unk> experiences?
So now I want you to an experiment with thinking.
Imagine that in the <unk> <unk> <unk> that at the end of the <unk> <unk> all the photographs <unk>, and that <unk> a medicine for <unk> <unk> nothing.
<unk> the same <unk>? And if you want to choose a different <unk>, you create a <unk> between the two <unk> and you have to think about how <unk> and <unk> that is not so <unk>, because if you think of in terms of time, then you have an answer.
And if you think in terms of <unk>, you could get another answer.
The because we <unk> the <unk> that we do, is a problem that <unk> us to <unk> choices between the two <unk>.
The two <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We actually <unk> two <unk> that we can use, one for every <unk>.
So, can you ask: How is <unk> the <unk> that makes experience?
And then you can ask: How much are the moments in the <unk> life that <unk> experiences?
And it's about happiness for moments is an <unk> process.
What are the emotions that we can measure?
And, by the way, we are able to do that, pretty good enough happiness of the <unk> that lives the experiences of <unk> that lives the experiences in time.
If you <unk> of happiness <unk> that you know, it's a completely different thing.
It's not about how much a <unk> person.
It's about how <unk> or <unk> is the person thinks of his life.
It's a very different idea.
<unk> that can't <unk> these two <unk>, not will do anything else that "create <unk> in the studies of happiness, and I <unk> to a group of <unk>, who <unk> the studies of <unk> in a long time exactly exactly exactly in this way.
The difference between happiness of <unk> that lives the experiences of <unk> that <unk> has been <unk> in the last few years, and I'm now <unk> to measure the two <unk>, the <unk> <unk> has a world <unk> where over a million people have been <unk> on a world where over a million people have been <unk> to a <unk> on what they think about their lives and their experiences.
And there were other studies in this direction.
So for the last few years, we started <unk> about happiness of two <unk>.
And the biggest lesson we learned, is that they're very different.
You have to know how much a person is <unk> with life, and yet that doesn't tell you much about how much <unk> <unk> your life and <unk>.
To give you a sense of the <unk>, the <unk> is about <unk>.
What if you <unk> somebody, and you say, "<unk>, his father is high father," How <unk> <unk> of his <unk>?
Well, I <unk> something on her <unk>, but with a lot of <unk>.
I always got a little bit of <unk>.
If I tell you that somebody thinks his life is at the level eight in a <unk> scale, in a <unk> <unk>, very <unk> on how happy they are with their <unk> that are <unk> experiences.
So the <unk> is low.
We have a certain knowledge of what <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We know that money is very important, <unk> <unk> are very important.
We know that being <unk> is <unk> with people who are <unk> us, <unk> of time with people who are <unk>.
There are other <unk> <unk>, but these are the main ones.
So if you want to <unk> happiness of two <unk>, you're doing things very different.
The <unk> of what I said is <unk> that we shouldn't think about happiness as a <unk> of <unk>.
It's about two completely different ideas.
In the <unk>, very quickly, another reason why we can't think about happiness is that we don't pay attention to happiness is that we don't think about the same things when we think about life.
<unk>, if you ask the question about how happy people are in California, you don't want to get the <unk> answer.
When you ask this question, you think you're <unk> to be <unk> in California, who are in <unk>.
What happens is that when you think about life in California, you're thinking about <unk> between California and other places, and you can, that <unk> is on climate.
<unk>, I'm <unk> that climate isn't important to the <unk> that lives the experiences that <unk> and it's not very important for the <unk> that <unk> that is what you <unk> are.
But <unk> the <unk> that <unk> is in <unk>, you could end -- some people could, at the end, <unk> in California.
And it's interesting to <unk> what people who <unk> in California in hope to be <unk>.
<unk>, the <unk> that lives <unk> experiences.
We know it.
But one thing happened. It was to be <unk>, because when you think, you know, you know, how terrible it was time in <unk>.
And I decided to have a right decision.
It's very hard to think of <unk> <unk> and I think I've got the idea of how hard it is.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I've got a question for you.
Thank you very much.
When we were on the phone a couple of weeks ago, he <unk> me that an interesting result that's from the <unk> of <unk>.
Is it something that thinks we can share because we still have a few minutes?
<unk> <unk>: Yeah.
I think the most interesting result we found in the <unk> <unk> is a number, which we're not going to get us to find.
We found that, with <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> that lives the experiences of the <unk>.
When we <unk> as <unk> as the <unk> <unk>, we found that, <unk> <unk> that, <unk> <unk> <unk> a year, for Americans, in <unk> <unk>, for Americans, on a very <unk> <unk> of about American <unk>, it's a very <unk> about American, <unk> <unk>, below a <unk> <unk>, below a year.
CA: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a year, people are <unk>, and they become <unk> <unk> as <unk> as they become more <unk>, Al of that we find a <unk> line.
I mean, I saw <unk> <unk> the lines.
<unk>, what happens is that money doesn't <unk> the happiness of the experience, but the <unk> of money certainly <unk>, and we can measure that <unk> very, very clearly.
In terms of the other <unk>, the <unk> that <unk>, is all another story.
The <unk> money, you're <unk>.
This talk is not about emotions.
CA: But <unk>, all the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>, the research of happiness.
If people <unk> this discovery, basically, they basically <unk> all of what we've <unk>, for example, politics on <unk> and so on.
<unk> the possibility that <unk>, and the country in general, can take a discovery like the <unk> and bring forward a public policy <unk> about it?
<unk>: I think that's <unk> the role of happiness in public policy.
The <unk> <unk> is going to be <unk> in the United States, but in the <unk> <unk>, is becoming <unk>, and other <unk> states.
People are starting to recognize that they should think about happiness when they think about public policy.
It <unk> a little bit and people start <unk> if they want to study their own experience of happiness or whether they want to study the <unk> of life that we need to start this <unk> <unk> to the <unk>.
As you <unk> the <unk>, it takes a <unk> of how you think, and on the second you think of the <unk> that you think of <unk> that <unk> or the <unk> that makes the experiences.
All of this <unk>, I think, in the years that we're going to.
In the United States, they're doing <unk> to measure the happiness of the population.
And that, I think, will come back to the next <unk>, maybe two, of the <unk> <unk>.
CA: <unk>, I think that's going to be, or for the least one should be, the <unk> of the most interesting policy <unk> to follow in the next few years.
Thank you very much for having the <unk> economy.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk today about energy and climate.
It may seem strange, because in my work at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>, things that <unk> and give the world to help the two billion people in the best lives of the best living better.
But climate and energy, in fact, are extremely important for these people, <unk>, are more important for them to everyone else in the world.
A climate means climate for many years, <unk> of <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>, or too <unk>.
<unk> <unk> in ways that their environment simply cannot support.
which brings to the <unk>. <unk>. <unk> <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk> are for them.
Even the cost of energy is, for them, important.
In fact, if you <unk> the price of one thing, to <unk> poverty, <unk> of much energy.
The price of energy is <unk> over time.
And a <unk> civilization through progress in <unk>.
The <unk> of the <unk> of the industrial revolution.
And in the <unk> century, we <unk> to a <unk> <unk> in the price of electricity, which is why we have <unk>, <unk>, we can create <unk> materials and do so many things.
So, in the world, we are for electricity in a <unk> situation.
But as the <unk> price, for example of half, we have to <unk> a new <unk>, the <unk> of CO2 emissions.
CO2 is <unk> the planet, and its <unk> is very simple.
<unk> <unk> a temperature <unk>, which <unk> <unk> effects.
<unk> on climate and, perhaps worse, <unk>, <unk>, in the sense that natural <unk> can't <unk> these <unk> changes and <unk>.
The <unk> of how much <unk> temperature because of a CO2 increase, and how we <unk> the two things are <unk>. And it's <unk>, but not very much.
And there's certainly <unk> about how much <unk> will be <unk>, but they're going to be extremely <unk>.
And so, I often asked the best scientists: do we have to reduce emissions almost zero?
Can't we just <unk> to half or a <unk>?
And the answer is, until you get almost zero, the temperature <unk> to <unk>.
So it's a big challenge, so.
It's not like saying, "You've got to go a <unk> <unk> <unk> under a <unk> <unk>."
It's not a <unk> <unk>.
It's about <unk> <unk>.
Now, we <unk> a lot of CO2 every year, over <unk> billion <unk>.
<unk> 20 <unk> per American.
For the <unk> of the poor countries, is less than a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The average world is about five <unk> <unk>.
And somehow, we need to make <unk> that <unk> to zero.
emissions are <unk> <unk>.
Just a few <unk> changes have changed this <unk>, so we have to go from <unk> to <unk>.
This <unk> has four <unk>.
It's a series of <unk>.
We have the <unk> on the left, CO2, which will <unk> be <unk>, and the <unk> on the right are the population, the services that on average, the energy media <unk> <unk>.
We have <unk> <unk> and we see how we can <unk> it.
<unk> one of these numbers have to <unk> it down to almost zero.
It's <unk> of <unk>.
Let's see a look.
The first <unk> is population.
The world has <unk> billion <unk>.
It <unk> us to the <unk> billion.
If we do a good job with new <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, we can <unk> maybe 10, 15 percent, but here will <unk> a increase in about 30 percent.
The second <unk> are the services that we use.
That <unk> all, food that <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>.
They are <unk>, and <unk> of poverty is to <unk> these services for almost everybody in the world.
And it's a <unk> thing that this <unk> number.
In the <unk> world, in a billion <unk>, probably we can use less, but on average, every year, this number <unk>.
And so, <unk>, the amount of <unk> <unk> services will be <unk>.
This is a very simple example of service.
You have the <unk> in your home, to do the <unk>, but these guys don't, so they <unk> and <unk> their <unk> under the <unk> <unk>.
How much of <unk> -- and, energy for <unk> <unk> service -- here we finally have good news.
This <unk> is not <unk>.
Thank you very much <unk>, new ways of <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, for many services, you can <unk> energy, for many services, you can <unk> energy.
In some services, you can reduce <unk> percent.
There are some other services, like <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> are very, very <unk>.
So, <unk>, in the best cases, energy <unk> <unk> <unk> from three to maybe six times.
But these first three <unk> <unk> emissions from <unk> to <unk>, in the best cases, perhaps <unk> billion <unk>.
It's not enough.
<unk> the <unk> <unk>, the key <unk>, the <unk> of CO2 <unk> for energy.
The question is, can we get to zero?
If you <unk>, no.
If you <unk> <unk>, no.
We <unk> all the ways to produce the electricity, <unk>, to <unk> <unk> and nuclear CO2.
So what we're going to do on a global scale.
And we need <unk> <unk>.
<unk> term "<unk>," I don't mean something impossible.
<unk> is a <unk>. The <unk> computer is a <unk>.
the Internet, and its services, are a <unk>.
People today have <unk> to creation of a lot of <unk>.
We usually don't have a <unk>, a <unk> by which is <unk>.
<unk>, it's <unk> to <unk> and something happens, something else doesn't.
In this case, we have to drive all the speed, and make a <unk> in a very <unk> time.
I asked: How do you <unk> this concept?
Is there any natural example, any <unk> that <unk> the imagination of people?
I <unk> a year ago, when I was <unk> <unk>, and people will make it fun.
We have them <unk> of the fact that, in the world, there are people who are <unk> with <unk>.
This is my idea for energy.
I decided that I could fly <unk> would be this year, my <unk> to the environment.
Here's the <unk>.
I'm saying that they're not <unk>, <unk> may not come out of the <unk>.
Now, we can <unk> <unk> this as this, but not will not be help.
We need a lot of solutions that are, that we're going to <unk> on very large, and <unk> <unk> is <unk> in many <unk>, I think only five important <unk> effects.
I <unk> the <unk>, the nuclear <unk>, nuclear <unk>, <unk>.
I also want to give some <unk>, and if they can do more than I do, but I'm interested in <unk> that I could work on <unk> of these five, and I'm not going to be <unk>.
<unk> for the first <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> or <unk> gas natural or <unk>.
Here our task seems simple, but it's not, and it's <unk> the CO2, after the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, somewhere, and <unk> that we <unk>.
There are now <unk> technologies that <unk> 60 percent -- 80 percent of CO2, but <unk> 100 percent will be very hard, and it will also be a hard <unk> to <unk> where we <unk> all this CO2.
The <unk> question is still the <unk> of the long run.
Who <unk>?
Who knows something that is literally billions of times more <unk> than any other kind of <unk> <unk>, like nuclear or anything else?
It's a huge <unk>.
So it's a hard problem.
And the other source is nuclear.
But also nuclear <unk> three big problems.
The cost, especially in <unk> countries, is high.
The <unk> <unk> that nothing can go to, <unk> <unk> that nothing can go, <unk> the <unk> is <unk> by human <unk>, and that <unk> doesn't <unk>.
And how do you <unk> <unk>?
<unk> the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> are many.
People need to be <unk>.
So, we're going to <unk> problems, which you could solve, and what you should work.
<unk> three of five <unk> I <unk>.
They are the people often <unk> "<unk>."
And to say the real, <unk> the great <unk> of <unk> <unk>, <unk> some <unk>.
The first is that the energy <unk> with these technologies are <unk> <unk> to that in central one <unk>.
It's about "<unk> power," and so many miles <unk>, of areas of times more <unk> than the <unk> of the normal <unk>.
And these <unk> are <unk>.
The sun doesn't <unk> all day long, or every day, and it doesn't always <unk>.
<unk>, if you <unk> from these <unk>, you have to find a way of <unk> energy even when the source doesn't make it.
We need to challenges we <unk> on the front of the cost.
And the distribution.
For example, this <unk> source is at <unk>.
So you don't just need technology, but you also have to do the <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk>.
And finally, the problem of <unk>.
To <unk> the size of the problem, I've <unk> all kinds of <unk> <unk> today, for cars, <unk>, <unk>, any kind of <unk>, I <unk> them with the amount of electric power in the world, and I found that all the <unk> <unk> in the world, and I found that all the <unk> in the world. And I found that all the <unk> <unk> minutes of that.
So we need a big step on, a hundred times than <unk> to <unk> the <unk> now.
That's not impossible, but of course it's not impossible.
This problem is already <unk> when <unk> <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>," <unk>, "20 or 30 percent of the energy <unk>.
If you then <unk> to those <unk> for 100 percent, you need a <unk> <unk>.
But how do you <unk> on this street? What is the right approach?
Is it a <unk> <unk>? What could this solve this problem?
A lot of companies, hundreds of <unk>, have to work.
We need at least percent of all these five <unk>.
Many of them, <unk>, <unk> <unk>. That's good.
And I think here, in the TED group, a lot of people who are already <unk> working in these <unk>.
Bill <unk> has different companies, in which a call <unk> that <unk> great technologies in the <unk> solar <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> in <unk> of companies that are doing great things, and they have interesting <unk>, and I'm <unk> my <unk> to this.
<unk> <unk> and I are <unk> a company that, you know, <unk> the nuclear street.
There are some <unk> in <unk>, nuclear <unk>, nuclear <unk>, nuclear <unk>.
But from a long time, the sector is <unk>, that there are some good ideas around is not so amazing.
The idea of <unk> is that, instead of just <unk> part of the <unk>, the <unk>, <unk>, <unk> percent of the available, we decided to <unk> the <unk>, <unk> percent. It's an idea <unk>, in a certain sense.
For the truth, it's been <unk> for a long time, but it's never been <unk> if it would <unk> or not, because of the <unk> of the <unk> today, you can do a <unk> and see that yes, with the <unk> materials, it seems that we're going to do.
And <unk> <unk> <unk> percent of the <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It <unk> the <unk>, and you use the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> today, which become, from the problem that they were, a <unk> <unk>.
It <unk> the <unk> as the <unk> <unk>. It's a kind of <unk>.
It's like a <unk> <unk>. It's called <unk> <unk>.
<unk> point of view the problem is <unk>.
Here's a picture of a place in <unk>.
This is the <unk>, <unk> percent of the <unk>, which was <unk> the part of the time <unk>, and so it's called <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> energy to the United States to <unk>.
And we <unk> the water <unk>, with a economic process, there would be enough for the rest of life of this planet.
So a lot of challenges we will, but this is an example of the hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to <unk>.
How should we measure our progress?
What should they <unk> <unk>?
<unk> the goal, and then we <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
You've heard a lot of people talking about 80 percent <unk> for <unk>, it's very important to <unk>.
20 percent will be produced by <unk> countries, and from a while.
At that point, we'll have <unk> the <unk> and the production of <unk>.
To get to 80 percent, so, the <unk> countries, <unk> <unk>, <unk> countries like China, will have to completely <unk> their own energy production.
The other question is, are we <unk> this technology to zero?
We <unk> it basically in <unk> countries?
<unk> we also have <unk>?
It's a <unk> <unk>.
It's a key <unk> of <unk>.
<unk> to <unk>, what should look like <unk> <unk>?
That should be the same two <unk>.
We had <unk> <unk> <unk> to start getting <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, <unk> will be the amount of CO2 CO2, and so the temperature.
But the <unk> in this matter, doing things that doesn't <unk> <unk>, has a single <unk> weight, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, to the other, which is the speed of innovation of new <unk>.
We have to <unk> these <unk> at all speed, and we can measure the speed from the number of companies, <unk> <unk>.
Many <unk> books have been <unk> about it.
The book is Al <unk>, "The choice," and David <unk>, "<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>."
These books are the problem and they create a context in which they <unk> the <unk> because these things are going to <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
A lot of things have to <unk> <unk>.
So I have a wish,
A very <unk> wish that <unk> technology.
If you could choose one just <unk> for the next 50 years, in fact, you can choose the country, the <unk> of a <unk>, which <unk> <unk> very, or do this thing that's <unk> half and not <unk> this thing that's <unk> half and <unk> this thing that's <unk> half and doesn't make this thing that last.
It would be that with the biggest impact.
If that wish doesn't <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> of the people who think about the United States and who's in the United States and China, between <unk> and China, <unk>, and most of the <unk> of those two billion people will be <unk>.
So what do we do?
What do I'm going to take the <unk> and <unk>?
It's got to be more <unk> to research.
When <unk> <unk> in places like <unk>, they shouldn't speak at the CO2.
You can also <unk> the <unk> <unk>, and you'll find a little bit of how much <unk> is going to <unk> in these <unk> <unk>.
We need <unk>, <unk> on CO2, the "<unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk> that <unk> the cost of <unk>.
We have to <unk> the message.
We have to make this more <unk> and <unk>, and it has to <unk> the government.
It's a <unk> <unk>, but I think <unk>.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you.
Thank you. Just to <unk> more on <unk>, that's --
first of all, can you <unk> a sense of the size of the <unk>?
Bill <unk>: <unk> the software, <unk> the <unk>, <unk> all the great scientists, which we already have done, <unk> <unk> of millions, and even when we have <unk> the materials in a <unk> <unk>, to be <unk> that will be <unk> to <unk>, <unk> only hundreds of millions of millions.
The difficult thing is to build the <unk> <unk>, find <unk> billion, the <unk> <unk>, where we built the first <unk>.
Once the first one, if it works like <unk>, it will be the <unk> of <unk>, because the cost, the <unk> of energy <unk>, are completely different from nuclear nuclear that we now.
CA: So, if you <unk> well, this <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, of a <unk> <unk> <unk>, of this kind of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Then the process starts from the top and <unk> down?
<unk>: Right. <unk>, now, are <unk> <unk>, many people, many <unk> that can't work, <unk> <unk>, things that are going to work and <unk> --
It's not good.
If you <unk> is very cheap, and you can <unk> <unk> for 60 years, <unk> into and <unk> all of those complexity.
<unk> there, <unk> for <unk> years, and then <unk>.
CA: A nuclear <unk> that makes it <unk> by itself.
<unk>: Yes. Well, the <unk> can leave there, you can leave them there, <unk> into another <unk> and <unk>.
And we <unk> with the <unk> already <unk>, now <unk> in <unk> <unk> or <unk>.
We <unk> our first <unk>.
So what was a <unk> problem is going to be the <unk> of our, and the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, as soon as this process is going to be.
CA: But what about the world potential of this technology that technology, where most interest in its <unk>?
<unk>: Well, there's no place in particular place, and there are all these interesting rules of <unk> on all that's <unk>, and so it's very <unk>.
Our <unk> has been in <unk>, India, China.
I just met <unk> for <unk>.
We've talked about how this idea is going to be <unk> to the current program.
They're <unk>. <unk> and <unk> have done in this field.
It's a <unk> on something that's already done.
It's a <unk> <unk>, but it's a kind of <unk> fast, that many countries have built, so anyone who built it, so anyone who has built a quick <unk> to <unk> our.
CA: What are the time and what are the <unk> that kind of thing is <unk>?
<unk>: Well, for one of these projects <unk> the whole thing that <unk> is <unk>, we're talking about 20 years for <unk> and 20 to <unk>.
It's this <unk> that the <unk> <unk> models that we should be <unk>.
<unk>, if all <unk> well, that's not <unk> <unk>, it could easily <unk> this goal.
And now there are, <unk>, <unk> of companies in the sector, which <unk>, if they work for their <unk>, if their <unk> <unk> <unk> are going to be <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And it's better if many solutions will have, because at that point will be <unk> to a <unk> of solutions.
It's necessary to be successful.
CA: <unk> of <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, this is the biggest you <unk>?
<unk>: A <unk> revolution is the most important thing.
It would be also without the <unk> <unk>, but the <unk> <unk> make it really much more important.
In nuclear <unk> of nuclear <unk> there.
We don't know their work well like this, but one is nuclear <unk>, a different approach.
There's a <unk> <unk>. It seems to me to do, but perhaps they say the same thing of us.
So there are many different, but the <unk> is that a <unk> <unk> <unk> a million times more energy than a <unk>, say, if you can <unk> <unk> <unk>, the potential, in terms of the environment and other, in terms of the environment, in terms of the environment and other, it's almost a <unk>.
CA: And if it doesn't work, what do we do?
We shouldn't we be able to <unk> <unk> <unk> to try to keep the <unk> temperature?
<unk>: If you <unk> in that situation, it's a little bit like when you <unk> too, and you're too <unk>, and you're going to have a <unk> <unk>.
Where do you start at that point? <unk> need a <unk> or something like that.
There's a whole line of research on the <unk> <unk>, which are various <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 20 or 30 years in which <unk> the action.
It's like a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> not need to be.
Some people say you shouldn't even work at <unk> because you could, you could continue to eat because you'd like to eat you to get so on, because the <unk> <unk> you.
I don't think it's a <unk> choice, but now in the <unk> of the <unk>, but now in the <unk> of the <unk> of solutions, in case, where the <unk> events are going to be <unk> later on the <unk>.
CA: <unk>: If I had a <unk> or two to <unk> them, like <unk> <unk> who <unk>?
<unk>: Well, there are different kinds of <unk> and those who <unk> <unk> are very few.
Some people say there is a <unk> <unk> because of the <unk> that <unk> the <unk> effects of <unk>.
It's very, very few things that you can also say that there is a <unk> on a million people <unk>. Here the main problem <unk>.
I'm going to have a <unk> now and <unk> the <unk> only <unk> a lot later.
And so, when you're <unk> by a thousand <unk>, the idea of making <unk> that we're only after --
<unk> for <unk> not well.
In fact, the <unk> <unk> is not <unk> the case; there's people in the world who looks at the <unk> and says, "OK, that's not that bad.
The fact is that the <unk> should <unk> to the action.
But my dream is that if we can <unk> <unk>, and <unk> the <unk> of CO2, then the <unk> <unk>: OK, I'm going to <unk> -- well, I don't care if we don't <unk> CO2, almost <unk> that <unk> because it's more economic <unk> technologies.
CA: That would be your answer to the <unk> <unk> <unk>, that if you <unk> all your <unk> to solve the CO2 problem, your other <unk>, your other <unk>, will be <unk>, and what's going to happen, when there are better things to do, that means <unk> resources?
<unk>: Well, the <unk> <unk> in research and development --
We say <unk> should <unk> 10 billion over the <unk> of the <unk> now is not so <unk>.
It should not be <unk> resources to other <unk>.
The things that are going to <unk> money, and also people may <unk>, are the <unk> to <unk> solutions.
It's especially the <unk>.
<unk> you're not <unk> the <unk> of <unk>, <unk> to the point where you're very cheap, I think <unk> <unk> <unk> in technology that have the potential <unk> <unk> in technology.
If the <unk> was, "<unk> the energy <unk>, so that only <unk> can <unk>," all of the people can pay for the energy can pay five times as much of life.
The <unk> would be for those two billion.
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is this thing, why is he's not <unk> more than <unk> and <unk>?
For her past, it's got <unk> between the <unk> <unk>, but he realized that it's a <unk> group of <unk>, and so he's <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
And it's a question that I think is <unk> <unk>.
It's amazing how little <unk> <unk> in research and development.
CA: Well, Bill, I think, just <unk> to speak to the audience, and I hope to see your <unk> to become reality. Thank you.
<unk>: Thank you.
I'd like to share with you a discovery that I did a few months ago as I was <unk> an article for the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I've always got my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Let me show you the result.
"<unk>," <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>: In form, strong, <unk>.
<unk> <unk> this list of voice to a friend and <unk> at the beginning, it was so <unk>, but as soon as I had the word <unk> my voice <unk>, and I had to <unk> from the <unk> and the impact that the <unk> of these words have left me.
You know, we're talking about an old <unk> of <unk>.
I'm thinking, it's going to be a <unk>, right.
But, in fact, the <unk> of <unk> was early '<unk>.
when I was <unk> schools and I was <unk> schools and <unk> what I was coming out of my family and <unk> to other children and the world around me.
and, <unk> <unk>, thank God, I was not using the <unk> of <unk> at that time.
I mean, from this <unk> seems that I'm <unk> in a world that <unk> somebody like me as a <unk> <unk> for them, when, in fact, I'm <unk> for the opportunity to do it, I'm <unk> for opportunity to the opportunity and <unk> my life has <unk>.
So, I immediately went to see on the <unk> <unk> in the network, <unk> to find a <unk> <unk>.
This is the <unk> version of <unk>.
<unk>, it's not much better.
I find <unk> two words under "<unk>" <unk> "particularly <unk>," and "<unk>." So, it's not just <unk> the words.
that's what we believe about people when they <unk> them with these words.
is about values behind these words, and how we <unk> them <unk> them.
Our language <unk> our own thinking and our <unk> of the world and how we see other people.
In fact, many <unk> civilization, <unk> that <unk> and that <unk>, which <unk> <unk> was more powerful, because to say things <unk> the <unk> to existence.
So, what do we want to bring it to <unk>, a person who is <unk>, or a person with greater force?
So, we were doing something simple as a person, we could <unk> <unk> and <unk> on their <unk>.
<unk> 't you <unk> <unk> for them?
And one person, so that he opened up <unk>, was the <unk> of <unk>, I was a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
His name is <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, whose name, <unk>, was too difficult to <unk> for most Americans, so it became <unk> <unk>.
And the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and a <unk> <unk> to work with children.
It <unk> almost anything about the time I've been in the hospital, with the <unk> of <unk>.
I had to do what I <unk> <unk> <unk> with these <unk> <unk> <unk>, in different colors, you know, to <unk> build the <unk> of the legs.
And I <unk> these <unk> more than anything.
I <unk> them, I <unk> them, really <unk>.
And, you know, I knew already, like a five years of five years with the <unk> <unk> to try to <unk> from these <unk>, <unk>, clear.
And, one day, he came to one of my <unk> <unk> and <unk>, these <unk>.
and she said, "<unk>, <unk>, you're a very strong girl, I think she <unk> a <unk>.
"When the <unk>, you get 100 dollars."
Now, it was just a little <unk> of the <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> that I didn't want to do in front of the perspective of the second, but, what he did was, was to give a different form.
and I <unk> in a interesting experience for me.
And I'm <unk> today, the <unk> of her <unk>, and her <unk> about me as a strong child, has <unk> my view of myself in a strong girl in the future.
This is an example of how adults with <unk> of power can <unk> the force of a child.
But, in the example of before with those <unk> <unk> <unk>, our language is not the opportunity to <unk> to the reality that everybody <unk>, the possibility of <unk> to the reality of seeing itself as <unk>.
Our language, it's not been at the step with changes of our society, many of which have been <unk> by <unk>.
of course, from a doctor's doctor, my legs, <unk> to <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> and even <unk> to <unk> <unk> that are <unk> people to <unk> with their ability, and to <unk> <unk> that are <unk> people to <unk> with their ability, and move to the people of their <unk>, <unk>, <unk> people of <unk>, <unk>, <unk> people of <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> to <unk> their own <unk>.
So, perhaps, <unk> technology <unk> now more than what's always been a truth, that each has something <unk> and <unk> to our society, and the human ability to <unk>, and human ability to <unk> is our biggest quality.
<unk> of <unk>, is something interesting about this, because people have been <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> and I have to tell you that.
This <unk> never went well, and I've always <unk> to the answer to people about this, and I think I'm going to try to understand why.
It's <unk> in this <unk>, <unk> <unk>, is the idea that success, or happiness, is <unk> on the other side of a challenge, if my success in life, if my success in life is a ability to <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of this experience, or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of a life with <unk>, or what people who are going to <unk> as my <unk>.
But, in fact, we're <unk>, we're <unk>, <unk>, from a challenge, <unk> or both.
And I <unk> that's a good thing.
<unk> is not a <unk> that we have to <unk> our life.
It's part of our life.
And I think it's like my <unk>.
And I <unk> it very, very <unk>, and sometimes almost nothing, but it's always with me.
And, of course, we don't <unk> to <unk> the impact, the weight of a person.
There are <unk> and <unk> challenges in life, and it's true to every single person, but the question is not whether we're not <unk> <unk> or not, but how we <unk> to deal.
So, our responsibility is not simply <unk> people to us from the <unk>, but <unk> it the right way.
And we do a lot of our children when we make them feel that they're not <unk>.
There is a important difference and <unk> between the medical <unk> that you're a <unk> person and the <unk> of the society that <unk> me <unk> me or not.
And, in fact, the only <unk> <unk> I had to face is if the world has ever thought I could be <unk> by those words.
In our <unk> to <unk> those who <unk> a <unk>, <unk> to their <unk> <unk>, or, really, the <unk> of their <unk> of life, we need to be <unk> not to put the first <unk> in a wall that actually <unk> somebody.
Maybe the <unk> model of looking at what's <unk> is in you and how you <unk> to a place, can <unk> more the <unk> that the disease itself.
In fact, I don't <unk> one person in <unk>, we're not going to understand his <unk>, and we're creating another <unk> disease that already have.
We're actually <unk> a <unk> to the value of a person in our community.
So we have to see through the disease and within the <unk> of human <unk>.
and, much more <unk>, there is a relationship between those <unk> <unk> and our <unk> creativity.
So, it's not about <unk>, or <unk>, these <unk> research as something that we want to <unk> or <unk> under the <unk>, but rather find those <unk> opportunities in a <unk>.
So, perhaps the idea I want to explain is that there's no thing like <unk>, as <unk> to it, <unk> <unk>, to use a term of the <unk> <unk>, perhaps even <unk> together.
And, perhaps, if we look a <unk> like a natural thing and useful, we're <unk> by its <unk>.
And a year, I <unk> the <unk> <unk> of Charles <unk>, and he was <unk> years ago, when he <unk> on evolution, I think, the truth, the truth to the human <unk>.
To put it in another way, it's not the <unk> of the <unk> that <unk>, and it's not even the <unk> one, is the one that you can get to changes.
<unk> is the <unk> of <unk>.
<unk> work, between other things, we can recognize that human ability to survive and <unk> is <unk> by the <unk> of the human spirit through <unk> in <unk>.
So, again, <unk>, <unk>, is our biggest quality.
And, perhaps, <unk>, we're not <unk>, we don't know what we're made.
Maybe that's what gives us the <unk>, a sense of <unk>, a sense of <unk>, a sense of <unk>.
So, we can do a <unk>.
We can, <unk> the <unk> as something that is <unk>.
Maybe we can see it as a <unk>.
The <unk> is a <unk> that we're not yet.
I think the biggest <unk> that we've <unk> is this idea of <unk>. Now, who is normal?
There's no normal, there's a common <unk>, there's a <unk>. There's no normal.
And you <unk> those <unk> people would say if you <unk>?
I don't think so.
If you <unk> this <unk> from one of how to get <unk> to one on the possibilities, or <unk>, to be a little <unk>, we can understand the force of so many children, and <unk> to <unk> their <unk> <unk> with the community.
The <unk> us that what we, as humans, we've always wanted for the members of our community is to be <unk>, that can <unk>.
There's a <unk> that in <unk>, 60 <unk> years ago, <unk> to <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> with <unk> <unk>, and, perhaps, because of the experience and the <unk> of these people was <unk> value, and, perhaps <unk> to the <unk> of the community. <unk>: they were <unk> as <unk> and <unk>.
And a few years ago, I was in a <unk> market where I came in that <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
and I was <unk> in front of a <unk> <unk>.
It was summer and I had <unk> <unk>.
I heard this guy, his voice of me said, "But, it's not <unk> <unk>." And I <unk>, and there's this man of <unk>. I had no idea who was.
And I said, "<unk>, <unk>, I'm going to <unk>? I don't remember <unk>. He said," He said, "But, you don't <unk> to get <unk>.
I mean, when we got <unk> you <unk> from your mother's <unk>. "
<unk>: Oh, that guy.
And, but of course, in fact, I <unk> a <unk>.
That <unk> was the <unk> <unk>, a man who had only known from my mother about that day, because, clear, <unk>, I <unk>, I <unk>, I <unk>, I <unk>, I <unk>, I <unk> in <unk> for two weeks.
And so, the <unk> <unk> of my mother went to <unk>, so the man who had <unk> me was a <unk> <unk> for my parents.
And, <unk>, I <unk> with the <unk>, and I had my <unk> <unk>, some of my <unk> in this foot, and some in that, he had to be the <unk>, this <unk> had to <unk> the bad news.
He said, "I had to give this <unk> to your parents who you never <unk>, and who never <unk>, and who never <unk> the kind of <unk> that have the other children or no <unk> life, and you've given me of the <unk> since then," <unk> <unk>. "<unk> thing is that <unk> <unk> of <unk> during my <unk>, which I had <unk> <unk> <unk> in my entire <unk>, which I had <unk> my school in my <unk>, a <unk>, which I had <unk>,
I had <unk> with <unk> <unk>, you know, the <unk> of <unk>, which I had won my <unk> <unk>, or all my <unk> <unk>, and all my <unk> <unk>, and <unk> them, <unk> to the students of his course, of school <unk> and <unk>.
And he's called this part of the course of the course of the course of the human <unk>.
<unk> <unk> can be able to keep in <unk> of how <unk> can be and how <unk> is in the quality of life of a person.
And the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and said, "In my experience, unless you say, and even though it's <unk> a <unk> <unk>, if it's just <unk> a <unk> of <unk>, if it's just <unk> it, a child will have us."
So, you see the <unk> <unk> changed his <unk>.
It's got to realize there is a difference between a <unk> <unk> and what everybody can do with it.
And there was a change in my thinking during the years, if you were asked to me when I was 15, if you were asked when I was 15, if I had <unk> <unk> with my legs in <unk>, and I would not have a second.
I would like that kind of <unk> at the time.
If I <unk> it today, I'm not <unk>.
And it's because of the experiences that I had with them, not to <unk> experience the experiences that I had with them.
and, perhaps, the change in me is <unk> because I was <unk> more to people who opened me the door of those who opened me.
You see, all you need is a person who's <unk> the <unk> of your <unk>, and you're <unk>. If you can give somebody the <unk> of their <unk> force, the human spirit is so <unk>, if you can do it, and you get a door for somebody at a moment <unk>, you can do it, and you can <unk> a <unk> in the best ways.
You're <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> themselves.
in fact, the <unk> meaning of the <unk> word is <unk> is <unk>, <unk> out what's inside, to bring the potential.
So again, what is the potential we want to <unk> out?
There was a case in the '<unk> in <unk> <unk>, when they were <unk> by schools.
It's called "<unk>" in <unk>, "We call it" <unk> "here in the <unk>.
that means <unk> the students <unk> from their <unk>.
And the students with the best <unk> have a <unk> program, and better teachers, <unk> well, they did for a period of three months, <unk> students have been given <unk> <unk>. "The <unk>" And they said they were <unk>, they were smart.
And at the end of this time, was <unk> <unk> <unk>. And, of course, the <unk> <unk> <unk>. And, of course, the <unk> <unk> of this study, and they took students from "<unk> said they were <unk>." And, that's what happened at the end of the three months.
I thought that was a school, beyond the <unk> that I'd left.
The <unk> part of this study was that even the teachers had been <unk>.
<unk> <unk> that had been doing this change.
The <unk> was saying: This is just the students from <unk>.
And so it's like they started to <unk>.
So, I think the real <unk> is to have a <unk> spirit, and a <unk> spirit of <unk>.
It doesn't see the beauty.
It's not our natural, <unk> <unk> and our <unk> ability to imagine.
If we can support the human spirit to <unk> the hope, to see the beauty in itself and in other people, to be <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> that we're using our <unk> force.
When the spirit has these <unk>, we can create new reality, we can create new ways of being.
I'd like to <unk> with a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> <unk> called <unk>, which has done me to know my friend <unk> <unk>.
and the <unk> is, "The <unk> that only <unk> four words," <unk> <unk> <unk>. "<unk> <unk>," <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk>," but God who only would say four words and <unk> to <unk>, and <unk> to <unk>, and say, "<unk> to <unk> with me."
Thank you.
