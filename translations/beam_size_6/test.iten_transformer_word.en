<unk> years ago , at TED , <unk> <unk> <unk> a challenge of <unk> called the challenge .
And the idea is very simple .
<unk> of four people have to build the <unk> <unk> possible that <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> and a <unk> .
<unk> has to be <unk> at the top of the <unk> .
And , even though it looks very simple , because it <unk> people to <unk> very quickly .
So I thought it was an interesting idea , and I <unk> it in a lab on the <unk> .
And it was a huge success .
And since then , I &apos;ve <unk> about 70 <unk> of this kind of <unk> around the world with students , designers and <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
There is something in this <unk> that <unk> <unk> important <unk> on the nature of <unk> , and I would like to share some of these <unk> with you .
<unk> , most people start with the <unk> to the task from <unk> .
<unk> , they say , &quot; You know what it might look like , <unk> for the power , and then <unk> time , <unk> .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> most of the time <unk> <unk> in <unk> structures and , at the end , at the end , when the time is about <unk> , somebody <unk> out the <unk> , and they <unk> it up in the top , make a step back and <unk> .
<unk> the job .
But what really happens , most of the time is that the &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; , &quot; because the weight of the <unk> does <unk> and <unk> the whole structure .
There &apos;s a number of people who have a lot of more moments moments moments than others , and between <unk> are <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> structures .
And there are groups that have a lot more structures &quot; <unk> , and , in the best , there are <unk> schools .
And it &apos;s amazing .
As <unk> says , not only create the most <unk> structures , but they &apos;re also the most interesting structures of them .
And your question is , how is it possible ?
And let me say , &quot; No one of the kids spend time trying to get the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> . &quot; Right .
We don &apos;t spend a lot of time <unk> for power .
But there &apos;s another reason .
And the reason is that the students in economics are used to find the single best project .
And then <unk> .
And after , what happens is that when you <unk> the <unk> at the top , they have no longer , and what happens ?
The crisis .
<unk> you <unk> ? Right .
What kids are doing <unk> , is that they <unk> from the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , one after the other , <unk> <unk> at the top of the <unk> , they have different possibilities of <unk> <unk> along the <unk> .
<unk> designer that kind of <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> process .
And with every version , the children have a <unk> <unk> on what works and what doesn &apos;t work .
So the ability to work on <unk> is <unk> , but we see how different <unk> <unk> .
The media for most of the people is about 50 <unk> , for the students of the economy , about half , <unk> , a little bit better , but not much better than many adults .
Who does better than everybody ?
<unk> and engineers , <unk> to the sky .
<unk> <unk> is the <unk> structure I &apos;ve ever seen .
And why ? Because it turns out that <unk> and <unk> models are the key to build <unk> structures .
Then we have <unk> <unk> , a little bit better than the media .
But that &apos;s where it gets interesting .
If you <unk> a <unk> <unk> , the group can do much better .
It &apos;s amazing . It &apos;s a little bit about , it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> that that this <unk> group . &quot; Do why ? &quot;
Because they have <unk> <unk> in <unk> the <unk> job .
<unk> the process , <unk> it .
And all the <unk> that <unk> and <unk> attention to work <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> of <unk> , and their <unk> lead to a safe success .
If you have 10 groups that usually work well , you may have six that <unk> structures that are coming up .
And I <unk> an interesting experiment .
I thought , <unk> <unk> for once .
I put on <unk> <unk> dollars of <unk> <unk> in software team .
What do you think this happened to the design students ?
What was the result ?
That &apos;s what happened .
<unk> has created a <unk> structure .
If one of them had built a <unk> <unk> structure , it would take home .
It &apos;s not interesting that a very high <unk> impact ?
We <unk> again the <unk> with the same students .
What do you think this happened ?
Now they had the value of a <unk> .
The same team , from <unk> has become the best .
They &apos;ve created the <unk> structure in time .
So they &apos;re <unk> <unk> on the nature of <unk> and <unk> success . So , why would somebody to spend time writing a challenge ?
The reason is this : aid to create <unk> <unk> and <unk> to help groups build , <unk> and <unk> .
And what makes a <unk> challenge is to help <unk> <unk> .
Because , <unk> , every project has his <unk> , isn &apos;t it ?
The challenge <unk> an <unk> experience , a common <unk> , a common position to build a <unk> .
And so , this is the value of this simple <unk> .
And those of you who are interested in .
It &apos;s a <unk> where you can take a look at how to build the <unk> .
There are <unk> <unk> .
There are <unk> examples from all over the world on how people <unk> and <unk> the system .
There &apos;s also the <unk> of the world .
And the most important lesson , I think , is that design is really a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> , and the <unk> of the most <unk> <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> to <unk> the challenge you .
And sometimes , a little <unk> of this experience is all necessary for a moment , &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; at a moment &quot; <unk> . &quot;
And all can make the difference .
Thank you very much .
<unk> you have to have a car , big , beautiful , <unk> , <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , is a time machine .
Everybody in this room has to <unk> .
You can go back , you can &apos;t go back ; you can &apos;t <unk> where you are .
And I would be <unk> to know what I &apos;m going to talk about , because I asked my friends for the last time , and everybody want to go back .
I don &apos;t know . You want to go back to before that there were cars or <unk> , or &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
I don &apos;t know .
They &apos;re <unk> that there &apos;s a kind of <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> it .
But I &apos;m not part of that group , I have to <unk> it .
I don &apos;t want to go back , and not because I &apos;m <unk> , it &apos;s because I &apos;m not going to go back .
So I want to go into the machine , and I want to move forward .
This is the best time we have been on this planet in every field that we can measure : health , <unk> , opportunities , <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
There &apos;s never been a time like this .
My <unk> <unk> , all of the <unk> , <unk> years .
My <unk> <unk> that number to 70 .
My parents are for 80 .
So it &apos;s better than there is a <unk> at the beginning of the number of years at my death .
But it &apos;s not only about people like us , it &apos;s a much bigger thing about this .
A child born in New <unk> .
<unk> . It &apos;s an amazing fact .
How does it be true ?
<unk> . <unk> has <unk> billion people on this planet .
It changed the <unk> of <unk> as a <unk> has ever done .
If <unk> is gone . <unk> .
We <unk> it . <unk> .
In the <unk> world , disease that <unk> million people only a generation ago , in practice .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> --
somebody knows what they &apos;re ?
<unk> , modern medicine , our ability to <unk> billion people , these are <unk> of the scientific <unk> .
And to me , the scientific <unk> , to <unk> things , see if they work , they work when they don &apos;t work , it &apos;s one of the great results of humanity .
These were the good news .
<unk> , they were good news , because there are other problems , and they were <unk> many times , for example , which is that , although everything we &apos;ve <unk> , a billion people go to bed <unk> on this planet , every day .
This number is <unk> , with incredible <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> .
And not only , we used our creativity to <unk> the planet .
<unk> <unk> , land <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , natural gas : are <unk> , and they are <unk> up quickly , and if we don &apos;t <unk> our <unk> to get out of this <unk> , <unk> us .
So the question is , can we do that ? I think , yes .
I think it &apos;s clear that you can produce food for <unk> billion people who live in .
I think it &apos;s possible to <unk> this world of energy without that this is .
I think about it , and not , it &apos;s not a <unk> <unk> .
But here &apos;s the thing that <unk> me <unk> at night -- one of the things that <unk> <unk> me at night .
We &apos;ve never had so much <unk> <unk> as we need it now , never , and we &apos;ve never been in the position of <unk> to the best of how we may today .
We &apos;re at an incredible <unk> events , in many <unk> .
But <unk> this , I think we should go back <unk> , 300 years before the <unk> , to find a period in which we <unk> the <unk> , a time that we <unk> them more <unk> , and more <unk> , than we do now .
People are <unk> in what they believe , and do we can &apos;t <unk> .
<unk> the truth can <unk> .
<unk> , everybody &apos;s right to their <unk> ; they also have to their own <unk> on the progress , but you know what you don &apos;t have ?
You don &apos;t have to your <unk> . You can &apos;t .
I put it a little bit in <unk> .
A <unk> of years ago I wrote a story about <unk> for &quot; The New <unk> , &quot; a short article .
And I was <unk> that somebody <unk> , who was <unk> to what is , after all , the measure of health care of all human history .
I didn &apos;t know what to do , so I did the <unk> , I wrote the story , and I went to somebody else .
Not much later , I wrote a story about <unk> food .
<unk> thing , just bigger .
People were <unk> .
So I wrote a story also about that , and I couldn &apos;t understand why people <unk> <unk> <unk> as &quot; food , &quot; because we <unk> that <unk> the molecules <unk> , instead of <unk> work in nature &apos;s <unk> .
But , as always , I do my job . I wrote the story and I went on .
I mean , I &apos;m a <unk> : <unk> , let &apos;s go to <unk> , <unk> .
But these stories told me and I couldn &apos;t understand why , but I got it .
The problem was that those <unk> that were <unk> to me was <unk> not <unk> at all .
They were <unk> people , <unk> , for good people .
They were just like people in this room .
And it really <unk> me --
But then I thought : <unk> , we have to be <unk> ; we &apos;re at one point , on this planet , where we don &apos;t have the same relationship with progress that there was one time .
We &apos;re talking about it <unk> .
We &apos;re talking about it in terms <unk> using <unk> , &quot; <unk> . &quot; OK , there are reasons for this , and I think we know what they are .
We have lost in institutions , in <unk> , and sometimes in science , sometimes in science , and it &apos;s <unk> that happened .
We have to do some <unk> and people <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of mass <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
I mean , everybody has his list .
We have questions and problems with people who <unk> had always right .
So <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> answers .
We didn &apos;t know anything for <unk> .
But here &apos;s the fundamental point : when the evidence is necessary , and we &apos;re not very <unk> in this .
And I think the reason for this is that we find in a <unk> of fear that I had never seen .
<unk> 12 years ago , it was <unk> a story , a <unk> story , which <unk> there was a <unk> between an <unk> and <unk> against <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
Very <unk> .
<unk> studies were made to see if it was true .
And it turns out to do hundreds of studies ; it &apos;s a big question .
<unk> the data .
<unk> from the United States , from <unk> , from <unk> , <unk> , and everyone was <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> .
He didn &apos;t make it . We didn &apos;t do it because we believe in <unk> , what we see -- what we think we can see , what makes us feel <unk> .
We don &apos;t believe a <unk> of the government <unk> that show us numbers , and <unk> it , I think it all <unk> .
But you know what ?
<unk> have been <unk> --
So , this is a fact : the United States is one of the <unk> of the world in which the number of <unk> against the <unk> is <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , and we should <unk> ourselves .
It &apos;s terrible .
What has happened to us to do something like this ?
Now , I &apos;m going to do it .
I mean , did anybody here ?
<unk> in the audience has ever seen a person died of <unk> ?
It doesn &apos;t happen a lot .
In this country , it doesn &apos;t happen , but it happened <unk> times in the world last year .
They &apos;re a good <unk> for <unk> , 20 every time .
But because it doesn &apos;t happen here , we can <unk> from your head , and people like <unk> can go around <unk> <unk> and <unk> by <unk> like <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And they can do it because they don &apos;t <unk> the difference between <unk> and <unk> .
We don &apos;t know that these two things seem <unk> , but they &apos;re not almost ever .
But it &apos;s something that we need to learn , and we need to <unk> them .
This man was a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It <unk> humanity from one of his <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , no <unk> -- the <unk> , <unk> -- <unk> .
The man in the middle , not <unk> .
It &apos;s called Paul <unk> .
It just created a <unk> against other people .
He <unk> his <unk> , 500 children every year in the developing world .
<unk> , isn &apos;t it ?
It &apos;s <unk> , if it &apos;s not that Paul goes around the <unk> , it says how <unk> and people are simply <unk> to <unk> .
And he says in these terms .
So , Paul is <unk> a <unk> .
When Paul in a public <unk> can &apos;t <unk> without a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s called it home because some of them like <unk> who know where his children go to school .
Why ? Because Paul has created a <unk> .
I wouldn &apos;t need <unk> , but the <unk> are <unk> .
If you try to <unk> , <unk> disease , <unk> disease , and it &apos;s going on .
We have a new <unk> in this country .
And it &apos;s going to be worse , and it &apos;s not much worse , because it &apos;s only about numbers .
And it &apos;s not just <unk> .
<unk> also ? <unk> that . Why not ?
My <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> wrote a couple of weeks ago , and he told me that he gave me a little <unk> .
<unk> me said before .
She wouldn &apos;t <unk> her son against the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
OK .
Why ? Because there is no <unk> to us . But you know what ?
We didn &apos;t have the <unk> in the United States .
I don &apos;t know -- maybe I &apos;m going to take a guy is <unk> on a <unk> plane , and it &apos;s <unk> to <unk> <unk> , now it &apos;s above the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> between a couple of hours , <unk> a car <unk> , and <unk> <unk> to one of these <unk> <unk> <unk> from TED .
He doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s been <unk> by a <unk> disease , and we don &apos;t know it because it &apos;s how the world works .
This is the planet that we live in . We don &apos;t <unk> that it &apos;s not the case .
We <unk> <unk> <unk> . We want to do that .
Have you got the <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> , a little bit of <unk> to start the day .
I know you did because the half of Americans do it every day .
<unk> that stuff , as it <unk> to <unk> medicine , and it doesn &apos;t matter how much they are <unk> .
<unk> always <unk> .
They <unk> the <unk> <unk> . More than that , almost ever .
But it &apos;s OK . You want to <unk> <unk> billion dollars to <unk> <unk> , I &apos;m with you .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> .
Why do we do that ?
I think , <unk> the big <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the great machine <unk> . We don &apos;t <unk> .
And we do well . Our <unk> system is <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> to millions .
It &apos;s absolutely cold , and it &apos;s also <unk> for those of us that can <unk> .
So we go away , and how do you <unk> ?
<unk> between the <unk> of the great <unk> .
It &apos;s great . We <unk> the great <unk> .
You know , it &apos;s a serious problem because this stuff is a <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> billion dollars .
I have a lot of examples here .
<unk> of these -- <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> , <unk> -- I don &apos;t know what it is , but we <unk> billion dollars , and it &apos;s a <unk> .
You know what ? When I say these things , people <unk> me against , and they say , &quot; But what do you want .
It &apos;s good . &quot;
<unk> a little bit ? You <unk> .
Because I don &apos;t care about whether it &apos;s the <unk> <unk> for <unk> and <unk> to say , &quot; <unk> , I don &apos;t have <unk> to hear the evidence of <unk> on the <unk> . &quot;
When we <unk> the street that leads to science and <unk> with <unk> and <unk> , <unk> in a place where we don &apos;t have to be .
<unk> like <unk> <unk> in South Africa .
He &apos;s <unk> 400 <unk> of his <unk> <unk> to say that <unk> , <unk> and <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that we know can <unk> the <unk> of AIDS .
<unk> of thousands of <unk> in a country that was <unk> more than any other from this disease .
Please , don &apos;t let me <unk> that there are no <unk> for these <unk> .
There are . There are always .
Now , the most <unk> <unk> in which we are in the middle right now is the <unk> war between the <unk> <unk> and the food <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> on <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s not science .
Every single thing that <unk> , every <unk> of <unk> , every <unk> of <unk> , every <unk> of <unk> , every <unk> of <unk> is <unk> by man .
You see , there was no <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> .
There was no <unk> .
There were no <unk> trees .
We did that over the last <unk> years .
<unk> <unk> and something else didn &apos;t .
And we <unk> what we don &apos;t understand .
We can now do it more <unk> .
And there are <unk> , of course , there are .
But we can <unk> things like <unk> A in <unk> , and this <unk> million people , <unk> their lives .
And we don &apos;t want to do that ?
I have to tell you , I don &apos;t <unk> it .
We are <unk> to the <unk> .
Why ?
<unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , we don &apos;t want <unk> fields to the same thing , it &apos;s wrong .
We don &apos;t want the <unk> companies on life .
We don &apos;t want the companies are <unk> <unk> .
You know , my answer to that ?
It &apos;s yes . You &apos;re right . It &apos;s got something .
It &apos;s true , we have a huge problem , but it &apos;s not science .
It has nothing to do with science .
It &apos;s law , <unk> , <unk> lines on <unk> .
You know , science is not a <unk> .
It &apos;s not a country .
It &apos;s not an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
It &apos;s a process , sometimes gives <unk> <unk> to times not , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t be at science of doing its work because we &apos;re really <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> to millions of people of <unk> .
You know , in the next 50 years , you &apos;re going to produce 70 percent of what &apos;s going to eat now , 70 percent .
These are the <unk> in Africa of the last 30 years .
<unk> . <unk> .
They need us , and we don &apos;t give .
Why ? <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We don &apos;t want to <unk> people to eat <unk> like <unk> .
<unk> billion people <unk> .
<unk> a little bit of a <unk> .
But it &apos;s only <unk> . <unk> <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t have <unk> <unk> , but the scientists are <unk> the way to <unk> that right now .
So a lot of people could eat and <unk> less the risk of getting <unk> .
You don &apos;t know about <unk> , and you know what ?
It would be very nice . It wouldn &apos;t be a <unk> of <unk> , but it would be very nice .
<unk> to <unk> <unk> : Why are we ?
I mean , <unk> : why are we <unk> this thing ?
Just why don &apos;t we want to <unk> the genes over there ?
It &apos;s about <unk> genes . It &apos;s not <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s not our <unk> <unk> for <unk> , or our <unk> to get bigger food , better , <unk> .
There &apos;s no <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s about save people &apos;s life , and it would be <unk> to understand what that means .
Why -- you want to <unk> ? -- if I don &apos;t want to <unk> it , and I &apos;m going to try something that I don &apos;t think <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
There is no other way of <unk> what &apos;s going on .
It &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , and we need to <unk> .
So , after this <unk> conversation , you could say , &quot; You will still go into this <unk> of time and go into the future ? &quot;
Yeah ! I want .
It &apos;s based on the present now , but we have an incredible opportunity .
We can <unk> the machine of time as we want .
We have a chance to go where we want , and we &apos;re going to do it .
We have to do these <unk> , and we need to think , but when we go into the machine of time , and we go ahead and get them happy to do it .
I know we can and , as far as I think the world needs .
Thank you .
Thank you .
One day , the <unk> of the <unk> Times <unk> <unk> was <unk> for the center of the <unk> <unk> <unk> when they <unk> a beautiful music .
<unk> <unk> by a man , a <unk> , fascinating man , with the <unk> <unk> , without <unk> , who <unk> a <unk> who had two <unk> .
I &apos;m going to tell a story that many of you know , because the <unk> of <unk> <unk> for a book , which , <unk> , was <unk> to the big screen , with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> the part of <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> in the part of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> that <unk> was <unk> because of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> was <unk> .
<unk> <unk> the <unk> , <unk> a terrible <unk> , and 30 years later , I &apos;m going to <unk> like a without the streets on the streets of <unk> <unk> <unk> in the center of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all of you to read the book , or to look at the movie to understand not just the <unk> <unk> that <unk> between these two men ,
My name is <unk> <unk> . I &apos;m a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> games for 10 years , and my <unk> for the next 10 years , is to try to save the next 10 years is to try to save the world as online games .
To do that I have a plan , and I <unk> in the most people , <unk> all of you , to spend more time doing more <unk> and interesting .
At the moment , three billion hours a week <unk> .
And some of you might think , &quot; <unk> a lot of time to play . &quot;
maybe too much time , <unk> how many problems we have to solve in the real world .
In fact , in my research , <unk> the <unk> for <unk> , actually , is the opposite .
<unk> billion a week aren &apos;t <unk> <unk> to solve the <unk> problems in the world .
In fact , I think if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we have to <unk> that <unk> .
I <unk> that the total we need is for <unk> billion hours every week .
It &apos;s probably an idea that a <unk> <unk> , so the <unk> , to <unk> the concept .
If we want to solve problems which <unk> , poverty , <unk> , climate change , <unk> , <unk> , I believe that we have the <unk> of playing online play , for at least <unk> billion to the <unk> , for the next <unk> . No , they &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> .
That &apos;s why . This is a <unk> picture , because I think I &apos;m going to play is so important for the <unk> of human species . <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , wanted to <unk> the game .
So she <unk> <unk> as she <unk> .
And this is a <unk> <unk> of play .
If you &apos;re not <unk> <unk> you can <unk> some of the <unk> of this picture .
You can probably see the sense of <unk> , a little bit of fear , but also , <unk> <unk> <unk> in a very difficult problem .
If you &apos;re <unk> <unk> , <unk> some of the <unk> , the <unk> around the eyes , and around the mouth is a <unk> <unk> .
And the <unk> <unk> show .
This is a <unk> <unk> at a step from something called a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , it &apos;s a term that you &apos;ve heard . OK . Okay .
So we have <unk> <unk> between us .
A <unk> <unk> is such a <unk> result that you don &apos;t seem as possible to when you don &apos;t <unk> it .
It &apos;s almost beyond the <unk> of the imagination , and when you <unk> is a <unk> to find out what you &apos;re really capable . This is a <unk> <unk> .
This <unk> is a step from a <unk> <unk> .
And this is the <unk> that we need to see on the <unk> of millions of <unk> of the problems in the world as we <unk> the next hundred years . <unk> the next hundred years . <unk> the <unk> of the next hundred years .
<unk> this is the <unk> that we see in the life of all the days as we <unk> to deal with <unk> problems .
This is the <unk> I call &quot; <unk> . &quot; I &apos;m not <unk> in the <unk> . &quot; And I &apos;m <unk> . &quot;
I &apos;m <unk> with <unk> . &quot; I &apos;m not <unk> in the <unk> . &quot;
This is a <unk> in my old neighborhood of <unk> , in California , where I did the <unk> about why we are more <unk> in the game than in real life .
And this is a problem of a lot of <unk> <unk> : <unk> that we &apos;re not <unk> as much as in games .
And I don &apos;t mean <unk> just as a successful <unk> , even though the success is : <unk> in the online <unk> .
But I mean , &quot; <unk> &quot; in the sense of <unk> to do something important , I started <unk> and <unk> .
And when we &apos;re in an online world , I think a lot of us become the best <unk> of itself , the most able to help them <unk> on a problem for all the time , to <unk> after a <unk> and trying to <unk> it .
And in real life , when you <unk> a <unk> , when you <unk> a <unk> , often we don &apos;t like this : we <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , maybe <unk> , <unk> or <unk> .
We never <unk> these <unk> as we <unk> , simply don &apos;t exist in a game .
So this is what I wanted to study at university .
What is that in a game , we feel that we can &apos;t get any <unk> ?
How can we <unk> those <unk> from games and <unk> to the real world ?
So I studied games like <unk> of <unk> , which is really the environment <unk> for <unk> problems .
And I started out some of the things that make <unk> so possible in the online <unk> .
The first is that , when you go into one of these <unk> <unk> , especially in <unk> of <unk> , there are different characters different <unk> that come to the point out of a mission to save the world . It &apos;s going to come from now .
But not any mission : a perfectly <unk> mission at the current level in the game . Right ?
So you can <unk> it .
They never give you a challenge .
But it &apos;s in your <unk> . So you have to <unk> <unk> .
But there &apos;s no <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , you don &apos;t have time to <unk> the <unk> , there is always something important and to do .
And there are also <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , hundreds of thousands of people , <unk> to you to <unk> your <unk> mission .
It &apos;s not such a common thing , this feeling that we have <unk> <unk> .
And there is this <unk> <unk> , this <unk> that <unk> , about why we are , and what we &apos;re doing .
And then all of this <unk> <unk> --
You &apos;ve heard about <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> one in intelligence .
I don &apos;t understand that kind of <unk> <unk> in real life .
When I <unk> this stage , I &apos;m not going to go in front of an audience , and <unk> one in <unk> ideas .
I don &apos;t understand that kind of <unk> in real life .
Now , the problem of <unk> online as a <unk> of <unk> is that giving so <unk> to be a step from a <unk> , all the time , which <unk> to spend all our time in these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s better than reality .
That &apos;s why , <unk> , <unk> , all of the <unk> of <unk> have been <unk> million years to solve the <unk> problems .
This is not a <unk> thing .
But in perspective : <unk> million years ago was the time in which one of our <unk> <unk> <unk> .
That was the first <unk> to walk <unk> .
Okay , so when we &apos;re talking about how long we &apos;re going to play , the only way we &apos;re going to talk about <unk> , is to talk about <unk> . It &apos;s a great thing , but also , because we &apos;ve discovered that we &apos;re going to <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> what we &apos;re able to do , what we &apos;re human , we &apos;re <unk> what we &apos;re going to be human heart .
This is true , I think .
So let &apos;s take this interesting <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> by a <unk> at <unk> University .
The young <unk> <unk> today in a country with a lot of <unk> culture , will have been <unk> hours of <unk> online <unk> , at the age of <unk> .
<unk> hours is an interesting number for two reasons .
First of all , for the children in the United States <unk> hours is the <unk> number of hours <unk> in the United States .
So we have a whole bunch of <unk> education in which young people <unk> as being <unk> <unk> <unk> at the time at school in which , everything else .
And some of you will probably read the new book by <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
If you &apos;ve done that you &apos;ve read it you &apos;ve read the <unk> theory , the theory of <unk> hours for success .
It &apos;s based on a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , which would say that if you <unk> hours of <unk> <unk> at any <unk> age .
<unk> <unk> in that something as much as the best people in the world .
So , what we have now is a whole generation of young generation is <unk> genes .
So , the question is , how do you get these <unk> ?
because if we could understand what this is going to be a lot of human resources without <unk> .
This is the number of people in the world who <unk> at least an online day to play .
These are our genes of the game .
500 million people who are <unk> <unk> -- in something .
And in the next <unk> , we &apos;re going to have a billion <unk> <unk> in that something .
If you don &apos;t know this , this is what <unk> us : the <unk> industry is <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> energy and work with the network rather than the Internet at <unk> <unk> <unk> of the Internet in India , in particular <unk> , China , <unk> , <unk> online <unk> .
<unk> is a billion <unk> in the next <unk> .
This is <unk> us to <unk> billion <unk> .
So , I started to think about what these games are <unk> us in genes .
These are four <unk> I <unk> . The first is a <unk> <unk> .
Okay . <unk> like a <unk> form of <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> is the <unk> to act immediately to deal with a <unk> , with a <unk> hope of success .
The <unk> <unk> believe that a <unk> is possible , and it &apos;s always worth <unk> , and <unk> now .
The <unk> <unk> are not with their hands .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in <unk> a social <unk> .
There are a lot of some interesting research showing that we find better with other people after having <unk> with them , even though they have <unk> .
And the reason is that it takes a lot of trust to play with someone : we have trust their time with us , who <unk> with the same rules and <unk> with the same rules and <unk> to the game .
So , <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> we have a lot of social <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> . <unk> .
You know , there &apos;s a reason why the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> hours a week , almost as a <unk> job .
It &apos;s because we know , as we <unk> , that we &apos;re <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> working , rather than <unk> or <unk> .
We know that we are <unk> , as a human being , to work <unk> to something that has .
And the <unk> <unk> are <unk> to work <unk> <unk> , if <unk> is <unk> a <unk> task .
<unk> , a <unk> meaning .
<unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> to <unk> <unk> , to human stories , on a <unk> scale .
For example , a little information to help create a context .
We all have <unk> , the biggest <unk> in the world .
The second largest <unk> in the world , with almost <unk> <unk> is the <unk> of <unk> <unk> million people use it every month .
They &apos;ve <unk> more information about <unk> of <unk> in the Internet , which is on any other <unk> in the world .
They &apos;re building a <unk> <unk> .
We were building a <unk> source of <unk> information .
OK , these are the four <unk> that together only <unk> one thing .
<unk> <unk> are individuals of <unk> <unk> .
These are people who believe they are capable of changing the world .
The only problem is that they &apos;re capable of <unk> <unk> , but not the real thing .
This is the problem I &apos;m trying to solve .
There &apos;s a <unk> named <unk> <unk> .
His studies are <unk> . He &apos;s <unk> the reason that people <unk> so much time , energy and money , in <unk> online .
He said , &quot; We &apos;re <unk> what &apos;s going to happen less than a mass <unk> into the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And it &apos;s a <unk> , so it &apos;s <unk> , and it says -- not like me , I &apos;m a <unk> .
But he <unk> -- he <unk> that this is a perfectly <unk> thing , because <unk> can get more <unk> in the online life .
We have to have more social relationships in a game that &apos;s not in real life .
You have a better <unk> and you get more <unk> in a game that is not in real life .
So , <unk> , for now , it &apos;s perfectly <unk> for the <unk> <unk> , to spend more time in the real world , I agree that this is <unk> , for now , but it &apos;s not , in fact , but it &apos;s not , in any way , a <unk> situation .
Here we have <unk> from something that <unk> <unk> years ago .
These are <unk> <unk> , made of <unk> <unk> <unk> , we had <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> . And these <unk> are the first tools that we had <unk> <unk> from humanity .
If you look at the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , you know , you will have this story .
It &apos;s the story of the <unk> and why .
<unk> <unk> that game , in particular , the games of <unk> , were <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> , during the time of <unk> .
I thought the <unk> was so <unk> , that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> to do something <unk> .
People in <unk> , the population was in <unk> , was a <unk> situation , they needed a <unk> solution .
So , <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> law for all <unk> .
One day , everyone would <unk> .
The next day , everybody would <unk> .
And it turns out that <unk> in the games of <unk> , from the moment that play is so <unk> , and <unk> us in a state of <unk> <unk> , who <unk> the fact that we have nothing to eat .
And so one day <unk> , and one day <unk> .
And by <unk> , I <unk> that 18 years , <unk> to <unk> <unk> a day and <unk> that <unk> .
I think that &apos;s exactly the way we use games a day of today .
It <unk> the game to <unk> the real world .
It &apos;s about the games to <unk> from everything that doesn &apos;t work in our real environment , from all that we don &apos;t believe in real life , and <unk> what we need from games .
But we don &apos;t have to <unk> <unk> here .
This is interesting <unk> : <unk> , after 18 years , the <unk> will not <unk> , so the <unk> <unk> that would have been <unk> to <unk> .
<unk> the entire <unk> <unk> , <unk> a <unk> in <unk> , and the <unk> of that <unk> <unk> to an <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> and <unk> in trying to find a new land where living , <unk> behind the right number of people to survive with the <unk> available resources , with hope to bring their <unk> from some other part , where they could have <unk> .
It &apos;s a little <unk> , right ?
But <unk> , studies on DNA <unk> that the <unk> that the <unk> that the <unk> that would then take the <unk> , <unk> DNA <unk> of <unk> .
So , scientists have <unk> that the story from <unk> is a real story .
And <unk> , they found <unk> of a global <unk> that <unk> almost 20 years could explain the <unk> .
So this incredible story could be true . It may actually have <unk> their culture , <unk> in 18 years , and then be so <unk> , and knowledge as well as <unk> <unk> in the game . And so <unk> .
OK , we can do it .
<unk> <unk> of <unk> from <unk> .
It was the first game of <unk> series of <unk> <unk> of <unk> . This is 16 years ago .
They started <unk> for 18 years , we started <unk> for 16 years .
I say , we &apos;re <unk> for our <unk> game .
They <unk> half of the population on a new world .
It &apos;s from here that <unk> the idea of <unk> billion hours a week .
We believe that half of us are <unk> for <unk> an hour a day to play , until we <unk> the problems of the real world .
You know what you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; How do we solve the real world problems in a game ? &quot; Well , that &apos;s what I &apos;ve <unk> my work in the <unk> years , <unk> the <unk> for the <unk> .
In our <unk> <unk> <unk> , we have this <unk> that <unk> our idea of how we should <unk> with the future .
We don &apos;t want to <unk> the future .
What we want to do is to <unk> the future .
You can imagine the <unk> from the best results , and then we want to give people the opportunity to actually <unk> .
We could imagine <unk> <unk> for people to <unk> .
I &apos;m going to show you three games that I &apos;ve done , and that &apos;s a <unk> of giving people the tools to create <unk> in their future .
This is &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
We did this game in <unk> .
It &apos;s an online game in which it <unk> to survive a <unk> of oil .
<unk> is not real , but we have <unk> <unk> material to make you believe that it is , and to make the real life living as if you can <unk> it . So , when you <unk> in the game , you <unk> in which area <unk> , and we <unk> you in a real time , we show you in real time , data that exactly the cost of the oil ,
The impact on the <unk> , if there are <unk> , if there are <unk> , and you have to think about how to <unk> your life <unk> if this is real . <unk> you have a <unk> on it , of <unk> .
We <unk> this game with <unk> <unk> in <unk> , and we <unk> them from then for three years , and what I can tell you is that it &apos;s a <unk> experience .
<unk> wants to change the way they live only because it &apos;s a good thing for the world or because it &apos;s a <unk> to do it .
But if you <unk> them in a <unk> <unk> and <unk> , &quot; we have no longer .
This is an amazing story ! A <unk> that you can <unk> .
<unk> yourself to see how they <unk> . &quot;
Most of our <unk> have learned in the game .
So , for the next play <unk> the world , we decided to save the world , we decided to <unk> higher the problem of oil <unk> .
We have a game called <unk> , at the <unk> for the <unk> , and the <unk> was : a <unk> has <unk> that humanity only have other <unk> years on this planet .
The <unk> is called &quot; <unk> of <unk> <unk> . &quot; <unk> . &quot;
We asked people to <unk> online almost like a <unk> <unk> film .
They <unk> the <unk> <unk> film , <unk> a dream team : there is the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and they all have something to do to save the world , but in our game , instead of having only five people in the dream team from , and that &apos;s your future <unk> , and it &apos;s your <unk> for the future of the future , the future of the future , the future of <unk> , the future and the future of the future , the future of the future , the future of the future , the future of the future , the future of the future of the future , the future , the future , the future of the future of the future of <unk> and the future , the
<unk> people <unk> for eight weeks , they <unk> 500 <unk> <unk> solutions that you can find if you go online and <unk> on Google &quot; <unk> . &quot;
And finally , the last game , <unk> the three <unk> of <unk> . This is a game with the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> game from the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , like <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> with <unk> <unk> for <unk> Africa , we &apos;re starting to learn the <unk> of social innovation .
There is a story in <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the imagination and the <unk> .
<unk> all of you to share this game with young people , everywhere in the world , in particular areas in the developing world , who may be <unk> from <unk> to start thinking about their social <unk> to save the world .
It &apos;s now to end .
I want to ask a question .
What do you think ?
We have all these incredible <unk> , we have these games that are <unk> projects of what we could do , but nobody of these have still <unk> the real world .
Well , I hope that we can agree with me that the <unk> <unk> are a human <unk> that we can use to do the work in the real world , that the games are <unk> , that we have these incredible <unk> , a social <unk> , this <unk> <unk> , the ability to <unk> a social <unk> , this <unk> and <unk> of an <unk> <unk> .
I hope that we can <unk> meeting to play games that are <unk> , to survive on this planet for another century , and my hope is that I &apos;m going to <unk> and <unk> as these .
When we go back to the next <unk> , two things are you that we can make any future to imagine , and that we can play any game .
So , I say , let &apos;s go to the games that <unk> the world .
Thank you .
For some time , I &apos;ve been interested in the <unk> effect , it may seem like a <unk> thing , if you <unk> , unless you get from my point of view , &quot; which is , &quot; something <unk> is being <unk> at <unk> point from being something real . &quot; In other words , the effect , in <unk> , because the <unk> of <unk> have a <unk> effect in some of the studies , just because the <unk> think
that what &apos;s happening is to a <unk> or something like that --
The pain <unk> , for example , if you believe they have a <unk> effect in the body called the <unk> effect .
<unk> of <unk> becomes something true for the <unk> that you have .
I want to show you a <unk> <unk> <unk> , very simple .
And I &apos;m going to show you how it works . This is a <unk> that &apos;s present in all the books for children .
I learned it alone with <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
I <unk> it for you and therefore .
And so I &apos;m going to tell you why I <unk> it .
Here &apos;s what happens .
The <unk> , which you can <unk> ; my hand , which you can <unk> .
I just <unk> my <unk> in my <unk> , like this .
<unk> on the <unk> .
To be sure that nothing <unk> or <unk> from my <unk> .
I &apos;m going to take my <unk> like this .
And so you can see that you &apos;ve ever got . We &apos;re going to be able to <unk> . We &apos;re going to go from my <unk> .
And the purpose of all that is simple .
I started <unk> my hand , and if all went well , my <unk> <unk> animal <unk> .
It &apos;s actually so <unk> to its place that I can <unk> , and the <unk> doesn &apos;t <unk> .
<unk> goes up or down from my <unk> .
<unk> . You can <unk> anything .
<unk> !
This is a <unk> that often <unk> to children .
which is <unk> to the <unk> , because you can learn a lot about the <unk> <unk> , even though <unk> is very simple .
Many of you in this room <unk> this <unk> .
Here &apos;s what happens to <unk> the <unk> in my hand .
I <unk> <unk> my <unk> .
to <unk> that <unk> or <unk> by my <unk> , this is a <unk> .
The reason I &apos;m <unk> the <unk> is because this is the <unk> of <unk> .
In the moment my hand is moving away from you , this finger here , my <unk> , <unk> , <unk> from <unk> was , in a position that <unk> in the outside of so <unk> .
There &apos;s somebody who didn &apos;t have a <unk> here .
That &apos;s the way , right here , right .
And when I also <unk> my finger .
We can talk about why it is <unk> , because we don &apos;t know that there are just three <unk> <unk> because the mind , and the way we <unk> information , not <unk> , one , two , three . They <unk> them .
But that &apos;s not the point . Right ? And when I <unk> my hand , I &apos;m going to go through the animal <unk> , but through <unk> , <unk> my <unk> here .
And when I <unk> my finger , same thing , when I <unk> back , this movement <unk> your finger .
<unk> away the hand . The <unk> is away .
It &apos;s a <unk> that you can do with your friends and <unk> . Thank you .
Now , what does this have to do with the <unk> effect ?
I read a <unk> , a year ago that <unk> me <unk> .
I &apos;m not a doctor or a <unk> , which was an amazing thing .
It looks like that if you <unk> a <unk> in the form of a <unk> <unk> , just a <unk> <unk> <unk> , has a <unk> effect .
But if you <unk> the form and <unk> the <unk> , in the form of a smaller <unk> , and the color and you <unk> a letter is <unk> .
Even though , there is no <unk> -- are <unk> of <unk> .
But a <unk> <unk> is not <unk> as a blue <unk> .
What ?
But anyway , it &apos;s not here .
<unk> are <unk> of any form .
A <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> by one <unk> and <unk> on the other is better than a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> has a role .
A <unk> twice a day , it &apos;s not as <unk> as three <unk> -- I don &apos;t remember the <unk> .
But the point is --
-- that these <unk> have a role .
And the shape has a role .
And if you want the <unk> <unk> , you have to use a <unk> .
Right ? A <unk> with something -- a couple of <unk> of something <unk> .
I <unk> it into a patient --
This is a <unk> image in their mind , much <unk> than the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s real , this <unk> -- let me show you one other time when I get <unk> .
The point is that the <unk> <unk> is not as <unk> as the blue that is not as <unk> as the <unk> , which is not as a <unk> .
And none of these has a <unk> quality .
It &apos;s just your believe that makes them in your <unk> and <unk> the effect .
I wanted to see if I could take this idea and start a <unk> <unk> .
And to do something that is a <unk> <unk> and make it real .
And we know from that study that when you want a effect need to use the <unk> .
This is a <unk> of seven <unk> , very <unk> .
I <unk> it a little bit .
This is my meat . This is not <unk> special .
This is my skin . This is not a <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m going to <unk> my skin and get this <unk> to the <unk> part .
If <unk> <unk> -- if I could easily <unk> -- I did it for some friends in the <unk> , the other night , and for some people who don &apos;t <unk> , and a woman is almost <unk> .
So if you can easily <unk> , you &apos;ll find that I &apos;m not going to <unk> the next <unk> in fact , you know , I &apos;m going to do the first <unk> here .
You can see , you can look at the other end .
So here &apos;s what happens , right here , the beginning of my <unk> to the lower of my arm just <unk> a little hole .
<unk> . I &apos;m <unk> you ?
And now a little bit through my skin , and out on the other side , like that .
Now , we &apos;re in the same position where we were with the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> but you can &apos;t <unk> my <unk> now , right ?
So I &apos;ll show you . Here , two , three , four , five , five , yes , right --
I know what people think when they see that .
He said , &quot; <unk> is not going to be so <unk> to just <unk> a few minute . &quot;
So , let me give you a <unk> .
How do you feel good .
Yes , I know it <unk> out there , &quot; OK , I don &apos;t have seen it . &quot;
People in the <unk> <unk> are <unk> .
Let me show you .
This is really my skin . It &apos;s not a special effect of <unk> .
This is my meat , and I can <unk> around .
I mean , if you <unk> look at the other end , don &apos;t look at it .
People at the bottom or whether it was true --
And there &apos;s a hole here and a hole here , if it was true . &quot;
Well , now I &apos;m going to get some blood for you .
Here .
I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> my arm , and I &apos;m going to show you that there are no <unk> .
But I think in this context and with the idea of taking something <unk> and <unk> into something true , the <unk> <unk> is , and I <unk> from the stage .
We have a lot of times in the next few days , I hope I will not <unk> the time . Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
So , in my life , I &apos;ve met a lot of fish .
I just <unk> two .
The first one is <unk> more than another <unk> story .
It was a <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> one of the most <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
That fish !
What was even better , was from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
So , you go to the <unk> in the <unk> .
I &apos;ve been <unk> in a relationship with this beauty for several months .
One day , the head of the company , I <unk> to talk to me about a <unk> event at the <unk> <unk> .
&quot; <unk> &quot; I said .
This was a company that <unk> to solve what happened was a <unk> problem for our <unk> .
How do we continue to have the fish in our <unk> ?
<unk> the last 50 years , we have <unk> in the same way that we &apos;ve <unk> to the ground the <unk> .
<unk> was <unk> .
<unk> percent of the big fish , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
There &apos;s almost nothing left .
So , we <unk> or less <unk> , the <unk> of fish , <unk> part of our future .
There are a lot of <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of fish <unk> , for the least the <unk> of them , and they are <unk> . They are <unk> . They <unk> the <unk> for example .
A big problem is there is a <unk> rate of 15 to one .
This means that it takes 15 <unk> of fish to get a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s not very sustainable .
And the <unk> is also not a big one .
So here &apos;s where , finally there was a company <unk> to do it in the right way .
I wanted to <unk> it .
The day before the event , I <unk> at the head of the company <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; I said , &quot; I said , &quot; You know , you &apos;re <unk> to do <unk> so far , in the open , which is not <unk> . &quot;
&quot; <unk> , &quot; he said , &quot; We are so <unk> by the <unk> that our <unk> are <unk> , not <unk> . &quot;
And then I said , &quot; We &apos;re basically a part of the world . &quot;
&quot; Is the <unk> rate ? <unk> at one said .
&quot; The best in the business . &quot;
<unk> to one , great .
&quot; Would you like to eat a thing ? What would you eat to the fish ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; he said .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; I said . And I <unk> the <unk> . &quot;
That night , I was in bed , <unk> , but what <unk> is a sustainable <unk> ?
So the next day , a little bit of the event , <unk> still <unk> .
I said , &quot; <unk> , are you going to give me some <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
He knew that he didn &apos;t , and he was going around .
Well , let &apos;s start with a little bit of people in the company , and no one <unk> <unk> .
<unk> finally <unk> with the <unk> <unk> .
He also <unk> .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; I said , &quot; Would you give me a few examples of <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
Well , he <unk> some <unk> some <unk> <unk> of the fish , and then said , &quot; <unk> of <unk> . &quot;
I said , &quot; <unk> of <unk> ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Yes , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . &quot;
He said , &quot; <unk> <unk> of your <unk> is <unk> ? &quot;
<unk> , say , two percent .
&quot; Well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
He said , &quot; <unk> , what is there is to the <unk> fish of <unk> to eat ? &quot;
There was a long <unk> on the phone and said , &quot; There are just <unk> in the world . &quot;
I &apos;m going to talk about this fish .
No , not because I &apos;m one of those <unk> <unk> of good food and traditional .
Well , actually , I am .
No , in fact , I &apos;m going to talk about this fish , because , you know , you know , you know , <unk> <unk> .
The second fish is a different love history .
It &apos;s a <unk> story that kind of history that <unk> the <unk> and the most <unk> .
We <unk> it for the first time in a <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
My <unk> was talking to me on this fish .
<unk> was <unk> .
<unk> on the table had a white color , almost <unk> .
The <unk> had too much <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> of how it had to be <unk> .
<unk> , it was still <unk> .
Who is able to make a good fish after <unk> <unk> ?
I didn &apos;t , but this guy .
<unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s actually called <unk> .
No , he didn &apos;t <unk> the fish , and it &apos;s not a <unk> .
For less , not in the sense that it &apos;s usually .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . The <unk> that is a <unk> of fish in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> was <unk> by <unk> .
<unk> <unk> on the one that was essentially a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> the earth by building a series of <unk> <unk> that the water in the river .
Well , we couldn &apos;t make it work .
And , from the <unk> point , it was a <unk> .
He <unk> something like 90 percent of the birds and , <unk> the place , it &apos;s about many birds .
So , in <unk> a company <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> the ground .
What do you do ?
<unk> the flow of <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Instead of <unk> water from the ground <unk> the <unk> to <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> .
<unk> a fish <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and in this process , <unk> and this company completely <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> is amazing .
I mean , you &apos;ve never seen something like this .
<unk> the <unk> that seems to be a million miles away , and everything that you see are <unk> <unk> and this <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
I was there a little time ago with <unk> .
It &apos;s an amazing guy , Charles <unk> <unk> and a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Okay ? <unk> <unk> in the middle of this <unk> and I <unk> , <unk> , I had the <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> its lesson of biology .
<unk> I <unk> a white <unk> .
And then he <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , and then he <unk> a kind of fish that <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> .
It turns out that <unk> <unk> <unk> in Africa .
I asked him how he became such a fish <unk> .
I said , &quot; <unk> ? I don &apos;t know any fish .
I &apos;m a <unk> in relationships . &quot;
And immediately after you <unk> on <unk> birds , <unk> <unk> and <unk> plants .
We didn &apos;t know , this was very fascinating , you know , something like the <unk> community .
It &apos;s interesting , but I was <unk> .
And my head <unk> to <unk> that <unk> fish that I had <unk> last night .
So I said , &quot; <unk> , what makes your fish so good ? &quot;
He <unk> the <unk> .
&quot; I know , I know , <unk> , <unk> , relationships , yes , it &apos;s amazing .
But what do you <unk> ?
What is your <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
Well , I <unk> about how their <unk> is a system so <unk> that the fish will <unk> exactly what happened in an <unk> environment .
The <unk> of plants , the <unk> , the <unk> , is all that <unk> the fish .
The system is so in health that it is completely <unk> .
There are no <unk> .
Have you ever heard of a <unk> who doesn &apos;t give up to eating his animals ?
I later , I was <unk> around with <unk> <unk> , and I said , &quot; In a place like this natural different from any <unk> I &apos;ve ever seen , how do you <unk> ? &quot;
In that <unk> moment , it was like the <unk> of a film had <unk> <unk> .
It <unk> the corner and <unk> a scene between the <unk> thousands and thousands of <unk> , and thousands of <unk> <unk> a real <unk> that <unk> <unk> to the eye .
&quot; That &apos;s the success , &quot; he said .
&quot; <unk> their <unk> are <unk> . They are <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? I was completely <unk> .
I said , &quot; <unk> , but are not <unk> with your fish ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , he said .
&quot; <unk> about 20 percent of the fish and the <unk> of the fish .
<unk> year on this property , there were more than <unk> species .
It has become the biggest and one of the most important <unk> <unk> for birds across Europe . &quot;
He said , &quot; <unk> , but a <unk> population of birds isn &apos;t the last thing that <unk> in a fish <unk> ? &quot;
<unk> your head , no .
He said , &quot; We <unk> <unk> not <unk> .
This is a <unk> network .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> is the <unk> of the most <unk> <unk> is the system . &quot;
OK , so <unk> : A <unk> that doesn &apos;t give us to eat his own <unk> , and that measure his success in the <unk> of his <unk> .
A fish <unk> , but also a <unk> for birds .
<unk> , by the way , those <unk> should not even be there .
<unk> the <unk> in a city <unk> <unk> miles where the ground of the soil are better for building .
Every morning , <unk> for <unk> miles and come to the <unk> and every night , you &apos;re doing other <unk> miles per <unk> .
They do it because they &apos;re able to follow the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> serious .
<unk> something like the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> so <unk> .
And I said , &quot; <unk> , <unk> <unk> miles up to the <unk> and then <unk> miles back <unk> ?
Do they do it for their little ? &quot;
I <unk> as if I had just <unk> a song of <unk> <unk> .
He said , &quot; No , they do it because food is better . &quot;
I didn &apos;t talk to you about my skin <unk> fish that was <unk> , and I usually don &apos;t like the skin of the fish .
I don &apos;t like <unk> , I don &apos;t like to <unk> .
It &apos;s that <unk> <unk> , like <unk> .
It never <unk> .
<unk> , when I <unk> it in that <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> didn &apos;t know for any skin of the fish .
He had a <unk> <unk> and <unk> was like giving a <unk> to the ocean .
He <unk> this to <unk> , and he <unk> .
He said , &quot; <unk> is like a <unk> .
It &apos;s the last <unk> before any of the fish .
It &apos;s <unk> for <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And then he said , &quot; But our water doesn &apos;t <unk> . &quot;
Okay . A <unk> who doesn &apos;t <unk> his fish .
A <unk> that <unk> its success on the basis of the success of his <unk> .
And then I realized that when he says the <unk> doesn &apos;t <unk> very much the thing because the water <unk> in that <unk> comes from the <unk> river that is a river that <unk> with all the things that the <unk> <unk> to bring <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And when it <unk> along the system , it <unk> the water is <unk> than when it &apos;s <unk> .
The system is so in health , which <unk> water .
So , not just a <unk> that doesn &apos;t take his animals not just a <unk> that size of his <unk> , but a <unk> that is literally a <unk> of the water <unk> , but a <unk> that is literally a <unk> of <unk> of water and not just for you .
Because when the water <unk> , you go to the <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> in the ocean , I know , but I <unk> the <unk> , and so I can also do that you because this <unk> of love as <unk> is also <unk> .
You could say it &apos;s a <unk> for the future of good food is going to be <unk> of fish .
What we need now is a <unk> new <unk> of agriculture in which food is really a good <unk> .
But for many people , this is a little too <unk> .
We are not <unk> , we <unk> food .
We are <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> of little <unk> .
<unk> the little <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of the local food <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
And when you believe that these are the things that <unk> the future of good food from some part <unk> and says , &quot; <unk> you , I also <unk> the <unk> <unk> , but how do you think we can <unk> the whole world ?
How do you <unk> the world ? &quot;
Can I be <unk> ?
It &apos;s a question that I don &apos;t like that .
No , no , because we &apos;re already <unk> that we can <unk> the world .
A billion people <unk> <unk> today .
One billion -- more than there have ever been -- because of the huge <unk> in the distribution .
You see , I don &apos;t like this question , because it <unk> the <unk> of our food system in the last 50 years .
<unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the fish <unk> , and all this time the <unk> industry , just asked . &quot; If we can get more people more <unk> , which is there are wrong in what we do ? &quot;
This is the <unk> .
It was <unk> .
It &apos;s been the <unk> business plan .
<unk> <unk> for what is , an industry in <unk> an industry that is quickly <unk> , <unk> the <unk> capital that makes capital possible .
This is not a industry , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
Our <unk> today is <unk> not because of the <unk> in <unk> but for the last <unk> , not for the last <unk> , but for the <unk> water , not for the <unk> , but for the water <unk> is not for <unk> , but for the <unk> water , not for the <unk> , but for the fish in the sea .
<unk> <unk> the world ?
<unk> <unk> : How are we going to <unk> ourselves ?
Or good , how can we create the conditions that are <unk> to every local communities in <unk> itself ?
In order to do that , we don &apos;t look at the model of the future .
It &apos;s a <unk> and <unk> model .
It &apos;s about capital , chemistry and <unk> , and it never really <unk> anything good to eat .
Instead , let &apos;s look at the <unk> model .
It &apos;s what we &apos;re going to put on two billion years of the experience on work .
<unk> in <unk> , <unk> as <unk> <unk> and <unk> that are not <unk> in themselves to <unk> that are not <unk> in themselves to <unk> that <unk> instead of <unk> <unk> that <unk> instead of only <unk> <unk> that are not only <unk> but <unk> in relationships , because they are the ones that are also <unk> in the <unk> .
If I have to be really <unk> , they &apos;re better <unk> than I &apos;ve ever been .
You know , I think that &apos;s good , because if that &apos;s the future of food , it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
Thank you .
I grew up with a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> a <unk> , an hour back and forth every day .
And I was always <unk> in a book , a book of <unk> , which <unk> my mind in other <unk> , and <unk> , in <unk> form , that <unk> sense , that <unk> sense of <unk> that I had .
And that <unk> also <unk> in the fact that every time I wasn &apos;t at school I was out in the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> them to the <unk> .
I was a real science <unk> .
But it &apos;s always <unk> to try to understand the world , understanding the <unk> of possible .
And my love for the <unk> actually seemed to <unk> the world around me , because what was happening in the late &apos; <unk> , we were going to the moon , we were going on the moon , <unk> the oceans , <unk> <unk> <unk> in our <unk> with its <unk> <unk> that <unk> us and places and a wonderful world that we couldn &apos;t imagine .
So , all seemed to <unk> my passion for <unk> .
And I was an artist .
I could draw . <unk> <unk> .
And <unk> , there were no <unk> of this <unk> film <unk> , and not all of these pictures in my head .
<unk> , when I <unk> a book , all <unk> , <unk> , to put something on the screen of our <unk> .
And so , my response was <unk> , draw creatures , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , robots , <unk> <unk> , all this stuff .
We had <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the behind the book of <unk> .
This is because creativity had to find a <unk> way .
And it &apos;s <unk> an interesting thing : the <unk> <unk> programs very <unk> me very much for the fact that there was a <unk> world right here on the earth .
<unk> I would never go to a <unk> world on a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> very <unk> .
But that was a world where I could really go for , right here on the planet , more <unk> and <unk> of what I could ever imagine <unk> these books .
So , I decided that I would become a <unk> at the age of 15 .
And the only problem was that <unk> in a small country in <unk> , <unk> miles from the ocean .
But I didn &apos;t let me <unk> .
I <unk> my father found a school in <unk> in <unk> , New York , just past the <unk> of where I was <unk> .
And so I was able to take the <unk> in a <unk> <unk> in <unk> , New York .
And I couldn &apos;t see the ocean , for another two years , until we <unk> it in California .
<unk> then , in the last <unk> 40 years , I &apos;ve <unk> about <unk> hours <unk> water , and 500 of these hours in <unk> .
And I learned that the <unk> of the ocean , even the <unk> ocean , are <unk> of amazing life that really goes beyond our imagination .
The <unk> of nature is without <unk> to our human imagination .
And today , I &apos;m <unk> from what I see when I do <unk> .
And my story of love with the <unk> ocean , <unk> than it &apos;s ever been .
But when I <unk> a career , from <unk> , I <unk> to make films .
It &apos;s got to be the best way to <unk> this <unk> of <unk> with images .
And , as a kid , <unk> <unk> <unk> and so on .
So making films was the only way to put together images and stories and stories .
All <unk> .
And of course the stories I <unk> to tell was stories of <unk> : &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; and &quot; The <unk> . &quot;
And with &quot; The <unk> , &quot; I <unk> my love for <unk> and <unk> with the <unk> of a film .
So , I <unk> the two <unk> .
<unk> &quot; The <unk> &quot; came out of something interesting that was <unk> a <unk> problem in that film , which is creating that sort of <unk> water <unk> , we <unk> the <unk> <unk> with the computer .
And so it was born the first character to the <unk> surface and <unk> to the computer that was ever seen in a movie .
And even though the movie doesn &apos;t have a lot of money , <unk> that &apos;s <unk> , I &apos;ve been <unk> of something extraordinary , all the public was <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
You know , it &apos;s the law of <unk> <unk> that every <unk> technology is <unk> by <unk> .
You &apos;re seeing something <unk> .
And that really <unk> me .
And I thought , &quot; <unk> , this is a thing that has to be <unk> in the <unk> art . &quot;
So , with &quot; <unk> two , &quot; my next film , we went far beyond .
<unk> with the <unk> <unk> and <unk> , we created the <unk> <unk> <unk> in that movie . The <unk> <unk> by how he would <unk> that effect .
And it <unk> . And we &apos;ve got a new <unk> .
And we <unk> the same result with an audience .
But we <unk> a little bit more with that movie .
So , <unk> a line between these two <unk> of experience , I &apos;ve come to the <unk> that this would be a new world , was a whole new world of creativity .
<unk> , I <unk> a company with <unk> <unk> , my <unk> friend <unk> , who was the main <unk> , who was the main <unk> and designer of creatures in that time , and we call it <unk> <unk> .
And the principle of society was <unk> to <unk> the past , the <unk> <unk> <unk> and so on , and go directly to the digital production .
And so we did , and we gave it an <unk> for a while .
But we went back to half the &apos; <unk> in the <unk> part of creatures and characters , which is what we had <unk> society .
So I wrote this text &quot; <unk> &quot; with the <unk> &quot; with the <unk> of <unk> on the <unk> effects , <unk> to the computer , with human <unk> , and all the major characters in the computers and the whole world in the computer .
And it &apos;s been <unk> to <unk> .
The kids in society have told me that they didn &apos;t have been able to do it for a while .
So , I <unk> it and I made this film of a <unk> <unk> .
I <unk> it there as a &quot; <unk> and <unk> on a <unk> . &quot;
It would be a story of <unk> love , a <unk> film .
<unk> , what I wanted to do was to see the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
That &apos;s why I did that film .
And it &apos;s the truth . They didn &apos;t know .
But I <unk> it up . I said , &quot; I &apos;m going to go to the <unk> .
The <unk> for the beginning of the movie .
It &apos;s very important . It &apos;s a great <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And I <unk> them to <unk> a <unk> .
It seems <unk> . But this <unk> us back to imagination that creates reality .
Because we really created a reality , and six months after I <unk> on a <unk> <unk> at two miles and <unk> in the <unk> of the North <unk> , to look at the true <unk> , not in a movie , not in high definition , but for really .
I was <unk> .
And there &apos;s a lot of <unk> , we had to build <unk> and <unk> and a lot of other things .
But I was <unk> by those <unk> <unk> , was like a <unk> mission .
Where everything was <unk> <unk> and <unk> enormous <unk> .
I <unk> you in this <unk> , you go down to this <unk> <unk> environment , where there are no <unk> to be <unk> , where you can &apos;t come back by alone .
And I thought , &quot; <unk> . It &apos;s like living in a <unk> film .
It &apos;s really great . &quot;
And so , I was <unk> by the <unk> of the ocean <unk> .
Of course , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It was <unk> .
It was <unk> . It was imagination .
And it was an experience that <unk> couldn &apos;t <unk> me .
Of course , I could imagine a <unk> , and create a <unk> effect . But I couldn &apos;t figure out what <unk> out of the <unk> .
In our <unk> , I saw creatures with <unk> <unk> and , sometimes , things that I had never seen before , things that nobody had ever seen before , that , in fact , they weren &apos;t even <unk> from science at the time that we <unk> and imagine .
So I was all taken from this , and I had to do more .
So I got a <unk> decision .
After the <unk> <unk> , I said , &quot; OK , I said , &quot; OK , I &apos;m going to go from my <unk> job for a while . &quot;
So , we started <unk> these <unk> .
We went to the <unk> and <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> .
We have a little robot that we created with <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And the idea was to go into and do an <unk> <unk> , which was never done .
<unk> had ever <unk> within the <unk> . They didn &apos;t have the <unk> to do it , so we created the technology to do it .
So here we go on the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> that <unk> just like this , where I knew they had <unk> their <unk> .
And I &apos;m <unk> a little <unk> <unk> through the <unk> of <unk> .
When I say this , I &apos;m <unk> , but my mind is in <unk> .
It seemed to me to be <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> .
And it was the most <unk> experience that I &apos;ve ever lived , because I &apos;ve ever lived in , before I knew what the <unk> would have been behind , before the <unk> <unk> , because I had the <unk> for months <unk> the film .
And the <unk> was based on a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> model .
So it was an absolutely extraordinary experience .
And it really <unk> to me that in the <unk> experience of the <unk> that you can <unk> through these <unk> , the mind is <unk> in <unk> , in this other form of existence .
It was really very deep .
And it could be a little <unk> of what could happen in some <unk> when you get <unk> for <unk> or other reasons in some kind of <unk> future , in some sort of the <unk> future that I can imagine , from the <unk> of which are .
So , we did these <unk> , and it started to <unk> what was there under , like the <unk> of the <unk> of the ocean where there were these <unk> animals .
<unk> , I &apos;m <unk> right here on the ground .
We live in a <unk> environment .
We don &apos;t go into a <unk> system on the <unk> of the sun as we do .
So , you can see animals that live close to 500 degrees <unk> .
It looks even impossible .
And at the same time , I was <unk> a lot of science , again , once again , is the flu of <unk> , <unk> .
And I ended up in the <unk> environment , really <unk> with NASA , <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of NASA , <unk> <unk> <unk> , going to <unk> , going to go to <unk> <unk> , and all these things , to fly to the <unk> <unk> <unk> with our <unk> .
It &apos;s been fascinating .
But what I &apos;m going to do is take scientists <unk> with us in <unk> .
And they <unk> down because they wanted to have <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> scientists , <unk> to these <unk> <unk> , <unk> down and <unk> them to see , take <unk> , <unk> and so on .
So , we were <unk> <unk> , but actually <unk> science , <unk> science ,
I had the <unk> between being <unk> <unk> , as a kid , to do those things for really .
And you know , in this path of discovery , I learned a lot .
I &apos;ve learned a lot of science . But I &apos;ve learned very much about <unk> .
Everybody thinks a <unk> <unk> is a leader , the <unk> of <unk> , or something like that .
I didn &apos;t know anything about <unk> before I do all those <unk> .
Because at some point I had to say , &quot; What am I doing here ?
Why am I doing that ? &quot;
It doesn &apos;t <unk> to do all these <unk> .
In <unk> we go to <unk> . There &apos;s no <unk> .
People think about that I &apos;ve gone to &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; which I <unk> the <unk> <unk> on a few <unk> .
I &apos;ve done all of these films , all these <unk> for a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , no <unk> , no money . What am I doing ?
I &apos;m doing it for the task in itself , for the challenge -- and the ocean is the largest challenge , for the <unk> of discovery , and to that strange <unk> that you <unk> when a little group of people form a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Because it was all with <unk> people , working together for years .
<unk> for <unk> months in <unk> for <unk> months .
And in that <unk> , you realize that the important thing is the <unk> thing that you have for them , and that they have for you , when you <unk> a task you can &apos;t explain to anybody else .
When you <unk> on the ground and it <unk> , &quot; We had to do this , and the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> , and that , all technology , and that , all technology , and the <unk> , the <unk> of the human <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , the <unk> of the human <unk> , or the soldiers who have lived all the <unk> or the soldiers have lived with something together and know that never <unk> .
<unk> a <unk> , create a <unk> of respect .
When I &apos;m <unk> to do my next film , which is &quot; <unk> , &quot; I &apos;ve been trying to <unk> the team and <unk> it to <unk> their respect .
It &apos;s really <unk> the <unk> .
And so I &apos;m going to <unk> here once again , with a little group , in <unk> <unk> with new technologies that don &apos;t get there .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
And we &apos;re <unk> a family , in the <unk> of four and a half years .
And she changed completely my way to make films .
People have <unk> by saying that I got organisms from the ocean , and I <unk> them on the planet .
For me , it was the <unk> of the way , the process itself , which was changed .
What can we do ?
What are the <unk> that we &apos;ve learned ?
I think the first is <unk> .
It &apos;s the most powerful thing that <unk> .
The imagination is a force that can actually <unk> a reality .
And the respect of the group is more important than all the <unk> in the world .
<unk> <unk> come to me and say , &quot; <unk> a few <unk> to do this . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Don &apos;t <unk> <unk> .
<unk> people <unk> the <unk> for you , you know , not by yourself .
And <unk> <unk> . &quot;
At NASA , they always say this <unk> , &quot; The <unk> is not <unk> . &quot;
But the <unk> has to be a <unk> in art and <unk> , because it &apos;s like doing a <unk> in <unk> .
And no important <unk> that has <unk> innovation is done without <unk> .
It &apos;s got to <unk> these <unk> .
This is the thought that I want to <unk> , which is in anything that is <unk> , but the fear doesn &apos;t . Thank you .
If you want to understand that today , you know , you know , the <unk> of the data that <unk> is bigger than the <unk> of its parts , and that , instead of thinking about <unk> information , I would like to give you new relationships so that we can get new relationships that we can see how we use information to make new <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s the <unk> <unk> <unk> for age .
This tool that I use is a little experiment .
It &apos;s called <unk> , and with <unk> , I can <unk> <unk> only one cause of death , say <unk> .
And now we see new relationships .
The reason is that here in the central part of the <unk> people are <unk> ; and there are more <unk> .
We can take a step back and <unk> the data because of death , we see that <unk> disease and cancer are the major <unk> , but not all of them .
If we go on and <unk> <unk> for age , we see that <unk> are the cause of death that we &apos;re going to be more .
<unk> <unk> , especially for men .
So you know that <unk> information and data in this way is a little bit like <unk> in a sea of <unk> information .
And if we can do it with <unk> data because we can &apos;t do it with <unk> ?
For example here we have the <unk> of any <unk> <unk> .
All over here .
You can see it in your <unk> and also try .
You can look at a <unk> .
Or a <unk> year .
You can <unk> a number in particular number .
For example , we take the <unk> <unk> in this number , their <unk> .
I &apos;m a <unk> <unk> <unk> , so I &apos;m going to go here and I see all the numbers in .
Now , if I want to take a look , could I think , &quot; Why don &apos;t you take a look at all the <unk> ? &quot;
<unk> a step back and <unk> the <unk> .
And I see <unk> <unk> .
Now , you know , you know , when you &apos;re going to understand that when you &apos;re going to get back and forth , it &apos;s not just a research , it &apos;s not <unk> .
But you do something different .
It &apos;s a way of the <unk> that we <unk> to use information .
We still have this idea that it may seem a little bit <unk> .
We took every single page of <unk> , and we <unk> it to a short <unk> that <unk> into a little <unk> , and a <unk> , which <unk> the <unk> area .
I &apos;m just going to show you the first 500 <unk> on <unk> .
Even in this <unk> <unk> we can do a lot .
It <unk> immediately which <unk> are the most <unk> on <unk> .
At this point , he <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
In this <unk> , we see that the <unk> of <unk> most often <unk> to this voice is the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
This is <unk> because it <unk> something that was in the pages of <unk> .
And you see it just <unk> up a step back to see the together .
If you take one of these <unk> , I can <unk> on the <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and everybody <unk> .
At this point , I can see that most <unk> <unk> from the world of science . A number of science <unk> .
Here &apos;s my head .
One is from music .
And , rather interesting , <unk> has also won a <unk> TED <unk> .
So let &apos;s start seeing all the <unk> of the TED <unk> .
For the first time , we &apos;re really <unk> in the network as if it was a network , not from page on the page , but at a <unk> level .
I want to show you another thing that might happen .
This is the New York Times site .
I mean , this <unk> -- I don &apos;t call it a <unk> , because it &apos;s not a <unk> , but it &apos;s still to see pages -- we <unk> this technology to every page , like this .
I can take a step back and immediately back to a <unk> <unk> . This is important because the only see the pages so I can see all the pages so I can see all the pages .
I can <unk> on what I did in <unk> moments .
In fact , you see the state of the <unk> I just <unk> .
I can sort of other things that I &apos;ve seen in the day .
If I want to take a step back and see all I can <unk> my <unk> or the <unk> of my research or the <unk> of my research .
Here we are <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> engine , here to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And from here , I can <unk> on my page and just <unk> it from here .
A <unk> <unk> many times , and in every case , the result is greater than the <unk> of the parts , of the data .
<unk> , in the world , data is <unk> as a kind of <unk> .
It &apos;s about <unk> of information .
It &apos;s about <unk> in data .
And if we <unk> all <unk> if we <unk> the Web <unk> instead of to go from one thing to the other , we &apos;ll go from many things to many other , and then see those structures that <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
And instead of <unk> <unk> in data , we could really <unk> information .
Instead of <unk> <unk> of information , we can <unk> out of knowledge .
And you know , maybe you get to the <unk> .
And with this <unk> you .
And these days everybody is talking about happiness .
I <unk> to <unk> the number of books <unk> the word &quot; happiness &quot; in <unk> and <unk> over the last five years , have <unk> to <unk> 40 , and there were many more .
There &apos;s a huge <unk> of interest in happiness , in <unk> .
There &apos;s a lot of <unk> about happiness .
We all have to make people <unk> .
But <unk> this flow of work , there are a series of &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; that somehow make <unk> ideas about happiness .
My talk of today is <unk> these &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And it &apos;s about <unk> people who think about happiness , and it &apos;s about <unk> that <unk> happiness , because we are <unk> all the other people .
The first of these <unk> is <unk> to <unk> complexity .
In fact , that the word happiness is not a useful word in how <unk> <unk> .
I think you can <unk> it to a particular meaning , but in the <unk> , <unk> <unk> of this <unk> and <unk> the most <unk> view of this <unk> and <unk> , the most <unk> view of what <unk> is the <unk> .
The second <unk> is the <unk> between experience and memory . It &apos;s basically about being happy in life and to be happy about your life or happy about your life .
And these are two very different <unk> , both of the concept of happiness .
And the third is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> the fact that we can &apos;t think of any <unk> that <unk> on the <unk> without <unk> .
I mean , it &apos;s a real <unk> <unk> .
and there &apos;s no way of doing the right thing .
I &apos;d like to start with an example of a person who , after a <unk> of questions and answers , after my lesson , <unk> a story .
&#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; &#91; <unk> &#93; <unk> <unk> music &#93; right at the end of the <unk> , <unk> a <unk> sound <unk> .
And then <unk> , in a very <unk> , who had <unk> the whole experience .
But it wasn &apos;t true .
What was <unk> was the <unk> of the experience .
He lived the experience .
And she had <unk> for 20 minutes of music .
But that &apos;s not going to happen because he worked with a certain <unk> ; I remember it was <unk> , and it was all that the <unk> .
What this <unk> tells us , at the bottom , is that we could think about ourselves and other people in terms of two <unk> <unk> .
There &apos;s a <unk> that lives in the present , who lives in the present , and it &apos;s able to <unk> the past , but it &apos;s <unk> only the present .
It &apos;s about the <unk> of the &quot; and what the <unk> is <unk> -- you know when the <unk> <unk> , &quot; makes you bad now , when you &apos;re going to here ? &quot;
And then there is the &quot; <unk> &quot; that &apos;s <unk> , &quot; that &apos;s <unk> , &quot; that <unk> your <unk> , and that &apos;s the <unk> of the history of our life , and that &quot; which is what the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : How you &apos;ve heard you in the last few days ? &quot;
or &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> your journey ? &quot; or something like that .
<unk> are two different <unk> , the <unk> that lives an experience , and what if the <unk> , and <unk> between the two is part of the <unk> on the <unk> of happiness .
The <unk> , is a <unk> .
And this process starts with a fundamental answer of our <unk> -- starts immediately .
We don &apos;t tell stories just when we talk about <unk> .
Our memory tell stories , <unk> , what we have is a story of our experiences is a story .
Let me start with an example .
It &apos;s an old study .
<unk> the experiences of two patients in a <unk> <unk> .
I didn &apos;t go into <unk> . It &apos;s not even <unk> a day , but it was <unk> when this study was <unk> in the &apos; <unk> .
They <unk> to <unk> patients <unk> their <unk> every 60 seconds .
And here are the results for two patients .
<unk> are their results .
If you ask , &quot; Who &apos;s got two more <unk> ? &quot;
It &apos;s a very simple question .
<unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
His <unk> <unk> more , and for every minute of <unk> <unk> from the patient . In fact , the patient <unk> has <unk> at least as much as it is .
But now there is another question : &quot; How much these patients think they <unk> ? &quot;
And here &apos;s the <unk> : <unk> the <unk> . <unk> A <unk> <unk> <unk>
The stories of the <unk> were different because one of the <unk> of the <unk> is the way you <unk> -- none of these stories is particularly <unk> -- but one of the two is particularly <unk> -- one of the two is particularly <unk> of the other .
And the <unk> is where the pain was <unk> at the end .
It &apos;s a <unk> story .
How do I <unk> ?
Why did we ask these people after the <unk> , and even a distance of time , &quot; How much <unk> is the experience , all <unk> ? &quot;
and <unk> <unk> for a long <unk> for you .
So this is a <unk> <unk> between the <unk> that lives the experience and the <unk> that the <unk> .
<unk> point of view that <unk> that lives the experience , is clear that <unk> has <unk> .
So , what you could do for the patient A , and we <unk> experiments , and we <unk> experiments , and it &apos;s actually done , and it works , you could <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> . And you can <unk> the <unk> <unk> without too much .
This is a little bit of pain in the patient , but only a little bit , and it &apos;s much less than before .
And by doing this for a couple of minutes , the <unk> that lives the experience of <unk> . A <unk> , and the <unk> that <unk> the <unk> experiences of <unk> . A very much better , because now the <unk> of his experience .
How do you tell a story ?
And that &apos;s true for the stories that come from the <unk> that are <unk> for the stories that are <unk> , the <unk> moments and the <unk> and the <unk> .
<unk> are very , very important , in this case , the final one .
So , the <unk> that lives living experiences life <unk> .
It &apos;s got moments in which it &apos;s <unk> . And you know , what happens to these moments ?
And the answer is simple .
It &apos;s <unk> for always to say that most of the moments of our lives -- for how I <unk> them -- I mean , the <unk> <unk> is saying about three seconds . That means that in a life , <unk> about <unk> million . In a month , if we <unk> about <unk> million .
Most of them are completely <unk> by the <unk> that <unk> .
And yet , in some way , you feel that they should be <unk> , that what happens in these moments of experience is our lives .
It &apos;s the <unk> that we &apos;re <unk> as we &apos;re in this world .
And as a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s not the story that the <unk> that <unk> <unk> for us .
So we have a <unk> that <unk> and a <unk> that lives experience that are quite different experiences .
The greatest difference between the two is like <unk> time .
In the view of the <unk> that lives the experiences of the <unk> , if you live in <unk> , and the second time , the <unk> of two weeks is two times better than the <unk> of a week .
But this is not completely the way the <unk> works .
For the <unk> that <unk> , a <unk> of two weeks is <unk> better than a week of <unk> because there are no new <unk> in <unk> .
You haven &apos;t changed history .
And in this way , the time is the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> that <unk> out of the <unk> that <unk> .
<unk> has a <unk> impact on this story .
<unk> , the <unk> that <unk> experiences <unk> more than <unk> and tell stories .
It &apos;s actually the <unk> that <unk> because if you <unk> a patient &apos;s who had , for example , two <unk> with two different <unk> and he &apos;s <unk> what he <unk> is doing .
The <unk> who live experiences doesn &apos;t have voice in these choices .
In fact , we &apos;re not <unk> between experiences , but among the <unk> of those experiences .
And even when we think about our future , we don &apos;t think about our future as experiences .
<unk> to our future as <unk> <unk> .
And basically you can <unk> this situation , like a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> , and you can think about the <unk> that <unk> as if you <unk> the <unk> that live the experiences of which , the <unk> that doesn &apos;t need .
I have the feeling that when we &apos;re going to <unk> <unk> the case that , <unk> in a good part of our <unk> that <unk> .
And this is a little bit difficult to <unk> .
<unk> , how much <unk> our <unk> ?
This is one of the <unk> who is <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
When I think about that , I get a <unk> in my mind a few years ago , which is one of the best <unk> of my life , and that I think <unk> often , respect to other <unk> .
And I &apos;ve probably got to think about the <unk> of that three weeks , to say , 25 minutes in the last four years .
If I &apos;ve ever opened the <unk> with <unk> photographs of the journey , I would <unk> another one . It &apos;s about three weeks of journey that <unk> into <unk> an hour and <unk> . It looks like there &apos;s a <unk> .
<unk> , I could be a little <unk> in my <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> , but even if you were more of this , a <unk> question is <unk> .
Why do we take weight of the weight that we <unk> experiences ?
So now I want you to an experiment with thinking .
Imagine that in the <unk> <unk> <unk> that at the end of the <unk> <unk> all the photographs <unk> , and that <unk> a medicine for <unk> <unk> nothing .
<unk> the same <unk> ? And if you want to choose a different <unk> , you create a <unk> between the two <unk> and you have to think about how to solve that <unk> and <unk> , in fact , if you think , in terms of time , you have an answer .
And if you think in terms of <unk> , you could get another answer .
The because we <unk> the <unk> that we do , is a problem that <unk> us to choices between the two <unk> .
The two <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In fact , two <unk> of <unk> , that we can use one for each <unk> .
So , can you ask : How much is the <unk> that makes experience ?
And then you can ask : How much are the moments in the <unk> life that experiences ?
And it &apos;s about <unk> happiness for moments .
What are the emotions that we can measure ?
And , by the way , we are able to do this , pretty good idea of the <unk> of the <unk> that lives the experiences in time .
If you look at the happiness of <unk> , which is a completely different thing .
It &apos;s not about how <unk> a <unk> person .
It &apos;s about how <unk> or <unk> it is when he thinks of his life .
It &apos;s a very different idea .
We &apos;re not going to be able to <unk> these two <unk> , not will be <unk> in the studies of happiness , and I <unk> to a group of <unk> students , who <unk> the studies of <unk> in a long period of exactly the same way .
The difference between happiness of the <unk> that lives and the <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> has been <unk> in the last few years , and they are now in the last <unk> to measure the two <unk> , the <unk> <unk> has a world where over a million people have been <unk> to a <unk> on what they think about their lives and their experiences .
And there were other studies in this direction .
So in the last few years , we started <unk> about happiness of two <unk> .
And the biggest lesson we learned , is that they &apos;re very different .
You have to know how much a person is <unk> with life , and yet that doesn &apos;t tell you much about how much <unk> <unk> your life and <unk> .
To give you an idea of <unk> , <unk> is about <unk> .
That means that if you <unk> somebody , and you say , &quot; <unk> , her father is <unk> , &quot; How many <unk> of his <unk> ? &quot;
Well , he <unk> something on his <unk> , but with a lot of <unk> .
It &apos;s always about <unk> .
If I tell you that somebody thinks his life is at the level of eight <unk> in a very <unk> <unk> on how happy they are with their <unk> who are living experiences .
So <unk> is low .
We have a certain knowledge of what the <unk> of the happy <unk> .
We know that money is very important , the <unk> are very important .
We know that being <unk> to be <unk> with people who <unk> us , <unk> of time with people who are <unk> .
There are other <unk> <unk> , but these are the main ones .
So , if you want to <unk> happiness of two very different things .
The <unk> of what I told is that we should not think about happiness as a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s about two completely different ideas .
In <unk> , very quickly , another reason why we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we don &apos;t pay attention to happiness is that we don &apos;t think about the same things when we think about life .
<unk> , if you ask the simple question about how happy people are in California , you don &apos;t want to get the wrong answer .
When you ask this question , you think it &apos;s going to be <unk> in California , in <unk> .
What happens is that when you think about life in California , you &apos;re thinking about <unk> between California and other places , and for example that <unk> is on climate .
<unk> , it turns out that climate is not so important to the <unk> that lives the experience and not very important for the <unk> that <unk> that is what we <unk> are people .
But <unk> the <unk> that <unk> is in <unk> , you could end -- some people could , at the end , <unk> in California .
And it &apos;s interesting to <unk> the people who <unk> in California in hope of being <unk> .
<unk> , the <unk> that lives are <unk> experiences .
We know it .
But a <unk> thing . It was <unk> to be <unk> , because when you think , you know , how terrible it was time in <unk> .
And I decided to <unk> the right decision .
It &apos;s very difficult to think of <unk> <unk> , and I think I &apos;ve been given the idea of how difficult it is .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you . I &apos;ve got a question for you .
Thank you very much .
When we were on the phone a couple of weeks ago , it <unk> me that an interesting result that &apos;s from the <unk> of <unk> .
Is it something that thinks we can share because we still have a few minutes ?
<unk> <unk> : Yeah .
I think the most interesting result that we found in the <unk> <unk> is a number , which we &apos;re not going to find .
We found that , with <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> that lives the experiences of <unk> .
When we <unk> like the <unk> <unk> with the income , we found that , in <unk> of an income per year , for Americans , on a <unk> <unk> , for Americans , on a very <unk> <unk> of about American <unk> , it &apos;s a very <unk> <unk> of about American <unk> , under a year .
CA : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> dollars a year , people are <unk> , and they become more <unk> . And they become <unk> as they become more <unk> , Al <unk> .
I mean , I saw <unk> <unk> the lines .
<unk> , what happens is that money doesn &apos;t <unk> the happiness of the experience , but the <unk> of money certainly <unk> <unk> , and we can measure that <unk> very , very clearly .
In terms of the other <unk> , the <unk> that is all another story .
More money , the more <unk> six .
This talk is not about emotions .
CA : But <unk> , all the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of happiness .
If people <unk> this discovery , basically <unk> all over what we &apos;ve been doing , for example , politics on <unk> and so on .
<unk> the possibility that <unk> , and the nation in general , can take a discovery like that <unk> and bring forward a public policy about it ?
<unk> : I think that <unk> the role of happiness in public policy .
The <unk> of <unk> is going to be <unk> in the United States , but in the <unk> <unk> , is becoming <unk> , and other countries .
People are <unk> to recognize that they should think about happiness when they think about public policy .
It <unk> us a little bit and people tend to <unk> if they want to study the experience of happiness or if they want to study the <unk> of life that we need to start this <unk> <unk> .
As you <unk> the <unk> , it takes a number of how you think , and on what you think about the <unk> that you think about the <unk> that <unk> or the experiences .
This is all about politics , I think , in the years .
In the United States , they &apos;re doing <unk> to measure the happiness of the population .
And that , I think , <unk> to be part by the next <unk> , maybe two , of the <unk> <unk> .
CA : <unk> , I think that &apos;s going to be , or for the least one should be , the <unk> of <unk> politics in the next few years .
Thank you very much for having the <unk> economy .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m going to talk today about energy and climate .
It may seem strange , because in my work at <unk> <unk> <unk> me of <unk> and <unk> , things from <unk> and giving the world two billion people in the best living better .
But climate and energy , in fact , are extremely important for these people , <unk> , are more important for them for everyone else in the world .
A climate means climate for many years , <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , or too <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in ways that their environment simply cannot support .
which leads to <unk> . <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> are for them .
Even the cost of energy is , for them , important .
In fact , if you <unk> the price of one thing , to <unk> poverty , <unk> of much energy .
The price of energy is <unk> over time .
And a <unk> civilization through progress in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> has <unk> that industrial .
And in the <unk> century , we <unk> to a <unk> <unk> in the price of electricity , which is why we have <unk> , <unk> , we can create <unk> materials and do so many things .
So , in the <unk> world , so we &apos;re about electricity in a <unk> situation .
But as the <unk> price , for example of half , we have to <unk> a new <unk> , the <unk> of CO2 emissions .
CO2 is <unk> the planet , and its <unk> is very simple .
CO2 <unk> causes a <unk> of temperature , which actually <unk> very <unk> .
<unk> on climate and , maybe even worse , effects , in the sense that natural <unk> can &apos;t <unk> these <unk> changes and therefore <unk> .
The <unk> of how much <unk> the temperature because of a CO2 increase , and how we <unk> the two things <unk> the other , is <unk> , but not very much .
And there &apos;s certainly <unk> about how much <unk> will be <unk> , but it will be extremely <unk> .
So , I often asked the best scientists : do we have to reduce emissions almost zero ?
Can &apos;t we only get half or to a <unk> ?
And the answer is that , until you get almost zero , the temperature <unk> to <unk> .
It &apos;s a big challenge , so .
It &apos;s not like to say , &quot; You &apos;ve got a <unk> <unk> <unk> under a <unk> <unk> . &quot;
It &apos;s not about &quot; <unk> a little bit . &quot;
It &apos;s about <unk> <unk> .
Now , we <unk> a lot of CO2 every year , over <unk> billion <unk> .
<unk> 20 <unk> per American .
For the <unk> of the poor countries , is less than a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The average world is about five <unk> <unk> .
And somehow , we need to make <unk> that <unk> to zero .
emissions are <unk> <unk> .
Some <unk> changes have changed this <unk> , so we have to move from <unk> to zero .
This <unk> has four <unk> .
It &apos;s a series of <unk> .
We have the <unk> on the left , CO2 , which <unk> to be <unk> , and the <unk> on the right are the population , the services that on average , the energy media <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and we see how we can <unk> it .
<unk> , one of these numbers have to <unk> at almost zero .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
We see a little bit .
The first <unk> is population .
The world has <unk> billion <unk> .
It <unk> us to the <unk> billion .
If we do a good job with the new <unk> , the <unk> , health , we can <unk> maybe 10 , 15 percent , but here <unk> a increase in about 30 percent .
The second <unk> are the services that we use .
That <unk> all , the food that <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
<unk> things , and <unk> of poverty is to <unk> these services for almost everybody in the world .
And it &apos;s an amazing thing that this <unk> number .
In the <unk> world , in a billion <unk> , probably can <unk> and use less , but on average , every year , this <unk> number .
And so , <unk> , the amount of <unk> <unk> services will be <unk> .
This is a very simple example of service .
You &apos;ve got the <unk> in your house , to do the <unk> , but these guys don &apos;t , so <unk> and <unk> their <unk> under the <unk> <unk> .
How much at <unk> -- and , the energy for <unk> service -- here finally there &apos;s good news .
This <unk> is not <unk> .
Thank you very much <unk> , new ways of <unk> , <unk> made , <unk> <unk> , for a lot of services can <unk> energy .
In some services , you can reduce .
There are others , like <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> are very , very , very <unk> .
So , <unk> , in the best cases , energy <unk> <unk> <unk> from three to maybe six times .
But these first three <unk> <unk> <unk> emissions .
It &apos;s not enough .
<unk> the <unk> <unk> , the key <unk> , the <unk> of CO2 <unk> for energy .
The question is , can we get to zero ?
If you <unk> , no .
If you get natural gas , no .
<unk> all the ways to produce today &apos;s electricity , <unk> , <unk> <unk> and nuclear CO2 .
So what we &apos;re going to do on a global scale .
And we need <unk> <unk> .
I mean , &quot; <unk> , I don &apos;t mean something impossible .
<unk> is a <unk> . The <unk> computer is a <unk> .
the Internet , and its services , are a <unk> .
People today have <unk> to creation of a lot of <unk> .
We usually don &apos;t have a <unk> , a <unk> within which <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> and something that happens , something else doesn &apos;t .
In this case , we have to drive all the speed , and make a <unk> in a very <unk> time .
I asked : How do this concept ?
Is there any natural example , any <unk> that <unk> the imagination of people ?
I <unk> a year ago , when I was <unk> <unk> , and people will make it fun .
<unk> them of the fact that , in the world , there are people who are <unk> with <unk> .
This is my idea for energy .
I decided that to fly <unk> would be this year , my <unk> to the environment .
Here &apos;s the <unk> .
They tell me that they &apos;re not going to go out of the <unk> .
Now , we can <unk> <unk> <unk> like this , but they &apos;re not going to help .
We need a lot of solutions that are , which is based on very large scale and very <unk> , and <unk> is <unk> in many <unk> , I think only five important <unk> effects .
I <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> , nuclear <unk> , nuclear <unk> , <unk> .
We also need to give some <unk> , and if they can do more than I do , but I &apos;m interested in <unk> that I could work on <unk> of these five , and I &apos;m not going to be <unk> .
<unk> for the first <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> or natural gas that is .
Here &apos;s our job seems very simple , but it &apos;s not , and it &apos;s <unk> the CO2 , after <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , somewhere , and <unk> that will <unk> us .
There are now <unk> technologies that <unk> 60 percent -- 80 percent of CO2 , but achieve 100 percent will be very hard , and it &apos;s going to be difficult to agree on where we <unk> all this CO2 .
The most <unk> question is anyway .
Who <unk> ?
Who knows something that is literally billions of times more <unk> than any other kind of <unk> <unk> , like nuclear or anything else ?
It &apos;s a huge <unk> .
So it &apos;s a hard problem .
The other source would be nuclear .
But also nuclear <unk> three big problems .
The cost , especially in <unk> countries , is high .
The <unk> issue of security , the <unk> <unk> that nothing can go , and <unk> the <unk> is <unk> by human <unk> , and that the <unk> doesn &apos;t <unk> .
And how do you <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> the <unk> , the <unk> are many .
People need to be <unk> .
So , you know , very difficult problems , which you could solve , and where you should work .
<unk> three of five <unk> I <unk> .
These are the people often <unk> &quot; <unk> . &quot;
And , in fact , the great <unk> of not <unk> a <unk> , <unk> some <unk> .
The first is that the <unk> energy <unk> with these technologies are <unk> <unk> to the central one of <unk> .
It &apos;s about <unk> energy . And so many miles <unk> , of areas of times more <unk> than a normal <unk> .
And these <unk> are <unk> .
The sun doesn &apos;t <unk> the whole day , and all the day <unk> .
<unk> , if you <unk> from these <unk> , you have to find a way of <unk> energy even when the source doesn &apos;t <unk> .
<unk> challenges we <unk> on the front of the cost .
And the distribution .
For example , this <unk> source is in <unk> .
So you don &apos;t just need technology , but you also have to do the <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
And finally , the problem of <unk> .
To <unk> the size of the problem , I <unk> all kinds of <unk> <unk> today , for cars , <unk> , <unk> , any kind , I <unk> them with the amount of electricity in the world , and I found that all the <unk> <unk> in the world and I found that all the <unk> in the world , and I found that all the <unk> in the world .
So we really need a big step forward , a hundred times than the <unk> now .
That &apos;s not impossible , but of course it &apos;s not impossible .
This problem is already <unk> when the <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; 20 or 30 percent of the energy <unk> .
If you then get those <unk> for 100 percent , you need a <unk> <unk> .
But what &apos;s the right approach ? What is the right approach ?
Is it a <unk> <unk> ? What could that solve this problem ?
A lot of companies , have to work .
We need at least hundred people in each one of these five <unk> .
A lot of them , <unk> <unk> . That &apos;s good .
And I think here , in the TED group , a lot of people are working in these <unk> .
Bill <unk> has different companies , in which a call <unk> that <unk> great technologies in the solar <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> in <unk> of companies that are doing great things , and they have interesting <unk> , and I &apos;m <unk> my <unk> to this .
<unk> <unk> and I are <unk> a company , which is <unk> you , <unk> the nuclear street .
There are some <unk> in <unk> , nuclear <unk> , nuclear <unk> , nuclear <unk> .
But from a long time , the sector is <unk> , that there are some good ideas around is not so amazing .
The idea of <unk> is that , instead of only <unk> part of the <unk> , the <unk> , is one percent of the available <unk> , we decided to <unk> the <unk> , <unk> percent . It &apos;s a <unk> idea , in a certain sense .
For the truth , it &apos;s been <unk> for a long time , but it &apos;s never been <unk> if it would <unk> or not , because of the <unk> of the <unk> today , you can do a <unk> and see it &apos;s going on .
And <unk> <unk> <unk> percent of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It <unk> the <unk> , and you use the <unk> <unk> of <unk> today , which become , from the problem that they were , a <unk> <unk> .
It <unk> the <unk> as the <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s a kind of <unk> .
It &apos;s like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In the view of <unk> the problem is <unk> .
Here &apos;s a picture of a place in <unk> .
This is the <unk> , <unk> percent of the <unk> , which was <unk> the part now <unk> as <unk> , and so it &apos;s called <unk> <unk> .
These &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> power to the United States for <unk> .
And <unk> water <unk> , with an economic process , there would be enough for the rest of life on this planet .
So a lot of challenges we <unk> , but this is an example of the hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need for <unk> .
How should we measure our progress ?
What should <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> the goal , and then we <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
You &apos;ve heard a lot of people talking about 80 percent of the <unk> . It &apos;s very important <unk> .
20 percent will be produced by <unk> countries , and a little bit of agriculture .
At that point , we &apos;ll have <unk> the <unk> and the production of <unk> .
To get to 80 percent , so , the <unk> <unk> , <unk> countries like China , will have to be completely <unk> their electricity .
The other question is , are we <unk> this technology to zero ?
<unk> we <unk> it in <unk> countries ?
Is we also <unk> <unk> ?
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a key <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what should look like the <unk> <unk> ?
It should also have the same two <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to start getting <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> will be the amount of CO2 CO2 , and so the temperature .
But the <unk> in this matter , doing things that we don &apos;t have big <unk> . It has a only <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , to the other , which is the speed of innovation of new <unk> .
We have to <unk> these <unk> at all speed , and we can measure the speed from the number of companies , <unk> <unk> .
A lot of books have been <unk> about it .
And the book is called &quot; The choice , &quot; The choice , &quot; and David <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
These books are the problem , and they create a context in which they <unk> the <unk> because these things are <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
A lot of things have to <unk> <unk> .
So I have a wish .
A very <unk> wish that <unk> technology .
If you had to choose one just wish for the next 50 years , in <unk> : you can choose the country , the <unk> of the country , the <unk> of an <unk> , or do this thing that &apos;s <unk> half and not <unk> this thing that &apos;s <unk> half and not <unk> this last thing that last .
That would be the biggest impact .
If this wish is not <unk> , the <unk> between who thinks and who &apos;s <unk> , between the United States and China , between <unk> and China , between <unk> and China , in <unk> countries , is going to be <unk> , and especially , life of those two billion people will be <unk> .
So , what do we do ?
What do I &apos;m going to take the <unk> and <unk> ?
It &apos;s necessary for research .
When <unk> <unk> <unk> in places like <unk> , they should not just talk about CO2 .
It also <unk> the <unk> program , and I &apos;m going to tell you how little <unk> in these <unk> <unk> .
We need <unk> , <unk> on CO2 , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , tools that <unk> the cost of <unk> .
We have to <unk> the message .
We have to make this more <unk> and <unk> , and it has to <unk> the government .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , but I think <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you .
Thank you . Just to <unk> more on <unk> , that &apos;s --
first of all , can you <unk> an idea of the size of the <unk> ?
Bill <unk> : <unk> the software , <unk> the <unk> , <unk> all the great scientists , which we already have done , <unk> <unk> of millions , and even when we have <unk> the materials in a <unk> <unk> , to be <unk> that will be <unk> to <unk> , <unk> only hundreds of millions of millions .
The difficult thing is to build the <unk> <unk> , to find <unk> billion , the <unk> <unk> , where we built the first <unk> .
Once the first one , if it works like <unk> , it &apos;s going to be the <unk> of <unk> because the cost , the <unk> energy <unk> , are completely different from nuclear power that we know today .
CA : So , if you <unk> well , that <unk> the building , well , of a <unk> <unk> <unk> of nuclear <unk> , of this kind of <unk> <unk> .
And then the process starts from the top and <unk> down ?
<unk> : Right . <unk> , now , are <unk> <unk> , many people , many people , many <unk> that can &apos;t work , <unk> <unk> , things that <unk> and <unk> --
It &apos;s not good .
If the <unk> is very cheap , and you can <unk> <unk> for 60 years , <unk> into and <unk> all of those complexity .
<unk> there , <unk> for <unk> years , and then <unk> .
CA : That &apos;s a nuclear <unk> out of <unk> .
<unk> : Yeah . Well , the <unk> can come up there , and then you can <unk> them in another <unk> and <unk> .
And <unk> with the <unk> already <unk> , now <unk> in <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
<unk> our first <unk> .
So what was a <unk> problem is going to be the <unk> of our , and the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , as soon as this process is going to be .
CA : But what about the world potential for the potential of this technology , where do you get a lot of interest in its <unk> ?
<unk> : Well , there &apos;s no place in particular place , and there are all these interesting rules of <unk> on everything that &apos;s <unk> nuclear , so it &apos;s very <unk> .
Our <unk> was in <unk> , India , China .
I just met <unk> for <unk> .
We &apos;ve talked about how this idea is going on .
They &apos;re <unk> . <unk> and <unk> have done in this field .
It &apos;s a <unk> on something that &apos;s already done .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s a kind of <unk> fast , that many countries have built , so anybody who &apos;s built it , so anyone who &apos;s built it .
CA : What are the time and what are the <unk> that kind of <unk> ?
<unk> : Well , for one of these projects to the whole thing that makes energy , which doesn &apos;t cost much , we &apos;re talking about 20 years for <unk> and 20 to <unk> .
This is the <unk> that the <unk> patterns .
<unk> , if all <unk> well , that &apos;s not <unk> <unk> , it could easily <unk> this goal .
And now there are , <unk> , <unk> of companies in the sector , which <unk> , if they work for their <unk> , if their <unk> <unk> are going to be <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s better if a lot of <unk> solutions , because at that point <unk> to a <unk> of solutions .
It needs at least <unk> .
CA : <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , this is the biggest one you <unk> ?
<unk> : A <unk> revolution is the most important thing .
It would be also without the <unk> <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> make it really much more important .
In the nuclear <unk> there are other <unk> .
We don &apos;t know their work well like this , but one is the nuclear <unk> , a different approach .
There &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . It seems to me to do , but perhaps they say the same thing of us .
So there are several of them , but the <unk> is that a million times more energy than a million times more energy than a <unk> , say , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the potential , in terms of the environment , in terms of the environment , in terms of the environment , in terms of the environment , in terms of the environment .
CA : And if it doesn &apos;t work , what do we do ?
We shouldn &apos;t we be able to <unk> <unk> <unk> to try to keep the <unk> temperature ?
<unk> : If you <unk> in that situation , it &apos;s a little bit like when you &apos;re too <unk> , and you &apos;re going to have a <unk> <unk> .
Where do you start at that point ? Do you need a <unk> or something like that .
There &apos;s a whole line of research on the <unk> <unk> , which are various <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 20 or 30 years in which <unk> the action .
It &apos;s like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> they don &apos;t need .
Some people say you shouldn &apos;t even work at the <unk> because you could , you could continue to eat because the <unk> <unk> you .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a <unk> choice , but now in the <unk> of the problem , but in the <unk> of the <unk> of solutions , in the case of the <unk> events in case .
CA : <unk> : If I had a <unk> or two to <unk> them , like <unk> <unk> that have <unk> ?
<unk> : Well , there are different kinds of <unk> and the ones that <unk> <unk> are very few .
Some people say there is a <unk> <unk> because of the <unk> that <unk> the effects of <unk> .
It &apos;s very , very few things that you can also say that there &apos;s a <unk> on a million people <unk> . Here the main problem <unk> .
I &apos;m going to have a <unk> now and <unk> the <unk> only <unk> much later .
And so , when you &apos;re <unk> by a thousand <unk> , the idea of making <unk> that <unk> only later --
<unk> for <unk> not well .
In fact , the relationship of the <unk> <unk> <unk> ; there are people in the world who looks at the <unk> and says , OK , it &apos;s not that bad .
The fact is that just that <unk> should <unk> to action .
But my dream is that if we can get <unk> <unk> , and to <unk> the <unk> of CO2 , then the <unk> <unk> : OK , you know , I don &apos;t care if we don &apos;t <unk> CO2 , almost <unk> that we <unk> it , but it &apos;s because it &apos;s <unk> .
CA : That would be your response to the <unk> <unk> <unk> , that if you <unk> all your <unk> to solve the CO2 problem , your other <unk> , your other <unk> , are going to be <unk> . And what &apos;s going to happen , when there are better things to do , that means <unk> resources ?
<unk> : Well , the <unk> <unk> in research and development --
We say that the <unk> should <unk> 10 billion in the <unk> of the <unk> now is not so <unk> .
It shouldn &apos;t be <unk> resources to other <unk> .
The things that make a lot of money , and they &apos;re also <unk> <unk> , are the <unk> to <unk> solutions .
For me , it &apos;s <unk> .
<unk> that you &apos;re not <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> to the point where it is very cheap , I think the <unk> <unk> <unk> in technology that have the potential for <unk> costs .
If the <unk> was , &quot; <unk> the energy <unk> , so that only <unk> can <unk> , &quot; all of the <unk> can pay for five times as much energy .
The <unk> would be for those two billion .
And <unk> also <unk> his <unk> .
His argument now is : &quot; Why don &apos;t it <unk> more <unk> than <unk> and <unk> ? &quot;
For her past again , you know , <unk> between the &quot; <unk> , &quot; but he realized that it &apos;s a pretty <unk> group , and so he &apos;s <unk> the question of <unk> and <unk> .
And it &apos;s a question that I think is <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s amazing how little <unk> <unk> in research and development .
CA : Well , Bill , I think that &apos;s <unk> <unk> of the audience who I hope to see your <unk> to become reality . Thank you .
<unk> : Thank you .
I &apos;d like to share with you one month ago as I was <unk> an article for the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ve always got my <unk> of <unk> <unk> every time I &apos;d <unk> something , but I &apos;d already finished <unk> the <unk> and I never realized that I never in my life for the word &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; to see what I would find .
Let me show you the result .
&quot; <unk> , <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> <unk> this list of voice to a friend of mine and at the beginning , it was so <unk> , but as soon as I had the word <unk> my voice <unk> , and I had to <unk> from the <unk> and the impact that the <unk> of these words have left me .
You know , we &apos;re talking about an old <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m thinking , it &apos;s going to be a <unk> , right .
But , in fact , the <unk> of <unk> was early &apos; <unk> .
when I was <unk> schools , I was <unk> schools and <unk> what I was coming out of my family and <unk> to other children and the world around me .
and , <unk> <unk> , thank God , I was not using the <unk> of <unk> at that time .
I mean , from this <unk> seems that I &apos;m <unk> in a world that <unk> someone like me as one who has nothing <unk> in any way for them , when , in fact , I &apos;m <unk> for the opportunities and <unk> that my life has <unk> .
So , I immediately went to see on the <unk> <unk> in the network , <unk> to find a <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> version of <unk> .
<unk> , it &apos;s not much better .
I find the <unk> two words under &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; particularly <unk> , &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot; So , it &apos;s not just <unk> the words .
that &apos;s what we believe about people when we <unk> them with these words .
is about values behind these words , and how we <unk> them <unk> them .
Our language flu our thinking and our view of the world and how we see other people .
In fact , a lot of <unk> , <unk> that <unk> , and that <unk> , which <unk> <unk> was more powerful , because to say things <unk> <unk> to existence .
So , what do we want to bring it , a person who is <unk> , or a person with greater force ?
So , we were doing something simple as <unk> a person , we could <unk> <unk> and <unk> on their <unk> .
<unk> &apos;t you <unk> <unk> for them ?
And one person , so that he opened the <unk> , was the <unk> of <unk> , I was a <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
His name is <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , whose name , <unk> , was too difficult to <unk> for most Americans , so it became <unk> .
And the <unk> <unk> always <unk> <unk> , and he had a <unk> <unk> to work with children .
It &apos;s basically anything about the time that I spent in the hospital , with the <unk> of <unk> .
I had to do what I was <unk> <unk> <unk> with these <unk> <unk> <unk> , in different colors , you know , to build the <unk> <unk> of the legs .
And I <unk> these <unk> more than anything .
I <unk> them , I <unk> them , really <unk> .
And , you know , I knew already , like a five years , with the <unk> <unk> to try to <unk> from these <unk> , <unk> .
And , one day , he came to one of my <unk> <unk> and <unk> , these <unk> .
And she said , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , you &apos;re a very <unk> child , I think he <unk> one of those <unk> .
&quot; When the <unk> , you get 100 dollars . &quot;
Now , of course it was just a little <unk> of the <unk> <unk> to make the <unk> that I didn &apos;t want to do in front of the perspective , but , what he did , what he did , was he to give a different form .
and <unk> in an interesting experience for me .
And I &apos;m <unk> today , the <unk> of his view , and his <unk> about me as a strong child , has <unk> my view of myself in a <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> person into the future .
This is an example of how adults with <unk> of power can <unk> the force of a child .
But , in the example of before with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , our language is not from the possibility of <unk> to the reality that everybody <unk> , the chance of a <unk> to see itself as <unk> .
Our language , it was not at the step with changes of our society , many of which have been <unk> by <unk> .
of course , from a doctor &apos;s doctor , my legs , the <unk> to the <unk> for <unk> , <unk> and also <unk> for <unk> <unk> that are <unk> people to <unk> with their ability , and <unk> people to <unk> with their ability , and to people in their ability to <unk> their own <unk> , <unk> , <unk> people of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> people of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , to <unk> their own <unk> .
So , perhaps , <unk> technology <unk> now more than what has always been a truth , that everybody has something <unk> and <unk> from <unk> to our society , and the human <unk> of <unk> is our biggest quality .
The human ability to <unk> , is something interesting , because people have wanted to <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I have to tell you that .
This <unk> never went well , and I &apos;ve always <unk> myself in <unk> in <unk> to answer people on this , and I think I &apos;m beginning to understand why .
It &apos;s <unk> in this <unk> , <unk> <unk> , is the idea that the success , or happiness , is <unk> on the other side of a challenge , if my success in life , if my success in life is <unk> from a ability to <unk> or <unk> of this experience , or <unk> the <unk> <unk> of a life with <unk> , or what people who are <unk> as my <unk> .
But , in fact , we &apos;re <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> , <unk> , from a challenge , <unk> or both .
And I think it &apos;s a good thing .
The <unk> is not a <unk> that we have to <unk> our life .
It &apos;s part of our life .
And I think it &apos;s like my <unk> .
It &apos;s always with me a lot , and sometimes almost nothing , but it &apos;s always with me .
And , of course , you don &apos;t have to <unk> the impact , the weight of the <unk> of a person .
There are the <unk> and the challenges in life , and it &apos;s true to every single person , but the question is not whether we &apos;re not <unk> <unk> or not , but as the <unk> to face .
So , our responsibility is not simply <unk> people to us from the <unk> , but <unk> it in the right way .
And we make a lot of our children when we make them feel that they &apos;re not <unk> .
There &apos;s an important difference and <unk> between the medical <unk> that you &apos;re a <unk> person and the <unk> of the society that <unk> me <unk> me or not .
And , in fact , the only <unk> <unk> I had to face is if the world has ever thought I could be <unk> by those words .
In our <unk> to <unk> those who <unk> a <unk> , <unk> on their <unk> <unk> , or , really , the <unk> of their <unk> of life , we need to be <unk> not to put the first <unk> in a wall that actually <unk> somebody .
Maybe the <unk> model of looking at what &apos;s going on in you and how it &apos;s going to place , it can <unk> more the <unk> that the disease itself .
In fact , not <unk> one person in <unk> , we &apos;re not going to understand his <unk> , we &apos;re creating another <unk> disease that already have .
We &apos;re actually <unk> a <unk> to the value of a person in our community .
So we have to see through the disease and within the <unk> of human <unk> .
and , much more <unk> , there is a relationship between those <unk> <unk> and our <unk> creativity .
So , it &apos;s not about <unk> , or <unk> , these <unk> research as something that we want to <unk> or <unk> under the <unk> , but rather find those <unk> opportunities in a <unk> .
So , perhaps the idea that I want to explain is that there &apos;s no thing as an <unk> , as <unk> to it , <unk> <unk> , to use a term of <unk> <unk> , perhaps even <unk> together .
And , perhaps , if you look a <unk> like a natural thing and useful , it &apos;s <unk> by its <unk> .
In the year , the <unk> <unk> of Charles <unk> , and it was <unk> years ago , when we <unk> on evolution , who <unk> <unk> , I think , the truth of the human <unk> .
To put it in another way , it &apos;s not the <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> , and it &apos;s not even that <unk> , is the one that &apos;s most smart to changes .
<unk> is the <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> work , among other things , we can recognize that human ability to survive and <unk> is <unk> by the <unk> of the human spirit through <unk> in <unk> .
So , again , <unk> , is our biggest quality .
And , perhaps , <unk> , we &apos;re not interested , we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re made .
Maybe that &apos;s what gives us the <unk> , a sense of <unk> , a sense of <unk> , a sense of <unk> .
So , we can make a <unk> .
We can , <unk> the <unk> as something that is <unk> .
Maybe we can see it as a <unk> .
The <unk> is a <unk> that we &apos;re not yet .
I think the biggest <unk> that we &apos;ve <unk> is this idea of <unk> . Now , who is normal ?
There &apos;s no normal , there &apos;s a common <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> . There &apos;s no normal thing .
And you want to <unk> those <unk> people ?
I don &apos;t think so .
If you <unk> this <unk> from one of how to get <unk> to one in the possibilities , or <unk> , to be <unk> a little bit more <unk> , we can understand the force of so many children , and <unk> to <unk> their own <unk> with the community .
<unk> us that what we , as humans , we &apos;ve always wanted for the members of our community , is to be able to help us .
There &apos;s a <unk> that in <unk> , 60 <unk> years ago , <unk> to <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> with <unk> <unk> , and , perhaps , because of the experience and the <unk> of these people was <unk> value of the community . <unk> : they didn &apos;t understand this people as <unk> or <unk> ; they were <unk> as <unk> and <unk> .
This year ago , I was in a <unk> market in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and I was <unk> in front of a <unk> <unk> .
It was summer and I had <unk> <unk> .
I heard this guy , his voice behind me , &quot; but , it &apos;s not <unk> <unk> . &quot; And I <unk> , and there &apos;s this man of <unk> age . I had no idea who was .
And I said , &quot; <unk> , <unk> ? I don &apos;t remember any <unk> <unk> . &quot; He said , &quot; He said , &quot; But , you don &apos;t stop <unk> .
I mean , when we came up with you <unk> from your mother &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
Oh , that guy .
And , but of course , in fact , I <unk> a <unk> .
That <unk> was the <unk> <unk> , a man who I had only known from the stories of my mother on that day , because , clear , <unk> , are <unk> in <unk> of two weeks .
And so , the <unk> <unk> of my mother went to <unk> , so the man who <unk> me was a <unk> <unk> for my parents .
And , <unk> are <unk> without the <unk> , and I had the <unk> <unk> , some of my <unk> in this foot , and some in that , he had to be the <unk> , this <unk> has had to <unk> the bad news .
He said to me , &quot; I had to give this <unk> to your parents who you never <unk> , and who never <unk> the kind of <unk> that have the other children or any kind of <unk> life , and you gave me of the <unk> since then , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; <unk> thing is , he said , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> during the whole thing , which I <unk> in my whole <unk> , which I <unk> my school in my <unk> , a <unk> ,
I had <unk> with <unk> <unk> , you know , the <unk> of <unk> , which I had won my <unk> <unk> , or all of my <unk> <unk> , and all my <unk> <unk> , and <unk> them , <unk> to the students of her <unk> medicine and <unk> .
And he &apos;s called this part of the course of the course , the <unk> of human <unk> .
<unk> <unk> can keep in account of how <unk> can be and how <unk> it is in the quality of life of a person .
And the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and said , &quot; In my experience , unless he said , &quot; In my own experience , and even though the <unk> is <unk> a <unk> of <unk> , if it &apos;s just <unk> at the same same same time , a child will <unk> us . &quot;
You see , so the <unk> <unk> changed his <unk> .
It turns out there is a difference between a <unk> <unk> and what everybody can do with it .
And there was a change in my thinking about the years , in this , if you ask me when I was asked when I was 15 , if I had <unk> <unk> with my legs in meat and <unk> I would not have a second .
<unk> that kind of <unk> at the time .
If I do it today , I &apos;m not <unk> .
And it &apos;s because of the experiences that I had with them , not to <unk> experiences that I had with them .
and , perhaps , the change in me is <unk> because I &apos;ve been <unk> more to people who <unk> me .
You see , all you need is a person who <unk> the <unk> of your <unk> , and you &apos;re <unk> . If you can give somebody the <unk> of their <unk> force , the human spirit is so <unk> , if you can do it and <unk> a door for somebody at a moment <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> in the best ways .
You &apos;re <unk> to <unk> the <unk> alone .
in fact , the <unk> meaning of the <unk> word is <unk> is <unk> , <unk> out what &apos;s inside , to bring the potential .
So again , what is the potential we want to <unk> out ?
There was a case in the &apos; <unk> in <unk> <unk> , when they were <unk> by schools .
It &apos;s called &quot; <unk> &quot; in <unk> , &quot; We call it &quot; <unk> &quot; here in the <unk> .
that means <unk> the students <unk> from their <unk> .
And the students with the best <unk> have a <unk> program , and better teachers , <unk> well , they did it for a period of three months , <unk> students have been given <unk> <unk> .
And at the end of that three months , were <unk> to the <unk> level of &quot; <unk> . &quot; And , of course , the <unk> <unk> of this study , and that they took students from &quot; <unk> said they were <unk> . &quot; And , that &apos;s what happened to the end of the three months .
I thought they were <unk> to school , beyond the <unk> that I &apos;d left .
The <unk> part of this study was that even the teachers had been <unk> .
The teachers didn &apos;t know that was done this change .
<unk> was saying : These are the students from <unk> , and these are the ones with <unk> .
And so it &apos;s like they started <unk> .
So , I think the real <unk> is to have a <unk> spirit , and a <unk> spirit of <unk> .
You can &apos;t see the beauty .
It doesn &apos;t have our natural , <unk> <unk> and our <unk> ability to imagine .
If we can <unk> the human spirit to <unk> the hope , to see the beauty in themselves and in other people , to be <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> that we &apos;re using our <unk> force .
When the spirit has these <unk> , we can create new reality and new ways of being .
I &apos;d like to <unk> with a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> <unk> called the <unk> <unk> that gave me my friend <unk> <unk> .
and the <unk> is , &quot; The <unk> that <unk> only four words , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , not the <unk> of <unk> , but God who only <unk> four words and <unk> to <unk> , and you know , <unk> to <unk> with me .
Thank you .
